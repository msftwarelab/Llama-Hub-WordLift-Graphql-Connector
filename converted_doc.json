        "text": "E-A-T E-A-T is an acronym for Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness. It became famous in 2015 after Google published its Search Quality Evaluator Guidelines, where E-A-T made its first appearance. These guidelines were a milestone in the SEO industry as they were fundamental for a deeper understanding of how Google evaluates web pages.What is E-A-T, and why is it such a big deal?Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness can be defined as a number of signals that contribute to determining Page Quality. While Expertise is a characteristic that belongs to the page content\u2019s author, Authoritativeness and Trustworthiness also belong to the page content and the website.&nbsp;In other words, E-A-T determines the reliability of a source by taking into account:the Expertise of the author in the fieldthe socially recognized Authoritativeness of the content itself, of the author, and of the sourceand also Trustworthiness considered as the ability to provide honest, true, and accurate information.Google wants to give its users the best possible experience. Before anything else, this means giving them a set of results that can offer real value and can be trusted.&nbsp;Here is why E-A-T is important. It measures the capability of a specific author, source, or page to provide authentic value to the search engine\u2019s users.&nbsp;Especially when it comes to sensitive topics such as shopping, financial, medical, legal, and news, Google is cautious about the E-A-T factor, as web information can have a real impact on a user\u2019s life. Google collects those topics under the acronym YMYL that stands for Your Money, Your Life and that clearly states how a simple search can have a huge and serious impact on one\u2019s safety.What can you do in terms of SEO to show your E-A-T?Working on E-A-T means taking care of a wide number of aspects that go from editorial choices in terms of transparency and method to media relations and the capacity of setting your brand as an authority. We will not cover all the parts of this meticulous job, but we would like to focus on a single and yet powerful aspect: Structured Data.&nbsp;As Lily Ray \u2014 who has devoted a lot of work and study to this topic \u2014 suggests, including structured data in your E-A-T strategy is a sure way to support and give strength to your overall effort. Using structured data, you will talk in the same language as Google, and all search engines will understand what you mean.&nbsp;Among the schema types that are essential to E-A-T, these apply to most situations:Person: which is needed to identify the author of the content. It can be further enriched by using schema properties such as affiliation, jobTitle, sameAs, and much more.Organization: which can be used to identify the publisher of the website. It can be further enriched by using schema properties such as address, founder, legalname, and more.WebPage, BlogPosting, Article and NewsArticle: which can be used to identify a piece of content on your website. It is essential to connect these entities to its authors with the schema property \u201cAuthor\u201d which will help you build a strong connection between content and authoritative persons.&nbsp;Schema types strictly depend on your content model and on the kind of business that your website represents.&nbsp;To learn more about E-A-T and structured data, I recommend watching this webinar that analyses it from different perspectives.&nbsp;[wl_navigator title=\"Related articles\" limit=\"4\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" offset=\"0\" uniqid=\"\" order_by=\"ID DESC\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/navigator.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "Image SEO: optimizing images using machine learning In this article, I will share my findings while evolving how we use neural networks to describe the content of images. Images greatly contribute to a website\u2019s SEO and improve the user experience. Fully optimizing images is about helping users, and search engines, better understand an article's content or the product's characteristics.The SEO community has always been keen on recommending publishers and shop owners invest in visual elements. This has become even more important in 2023 as Google announced that over 10 billion people already use Lens.With our next generation of AI-powered technology, we\u2019re making it more visual, natural and intuitive to explore information.Elizabeth Reid VP, Search at GoogleTable of content:\u00a0Google's Image SEO best practices in 2023What is Agentive SEOHow to enrich image alt text on your website using AI.Evaluating language-vision modelsIntroducing LAVIS (short for LAnguage-VISion)Running the workflow for automatic image captioningContent moderationGet Comfortable with experimentsDon\u2019t settle for less than the best modelVisual Question Answering (VQA)ConclusionsHow I worked a few years agoReport from the first experiments using CNN and LSTMLast but not least: Image SEO Resolution[caption id=\"attachment_10292\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"800\"] Google\u2019s Image Search user interface[/caption]There are several aspects that Google mentions in its list of best practices for images that have been recently updated, but the work I\u2019ve been focusing on, for this article, is about providing alt text and captions in a semi-automated way. Alt text and captions, in general, improve accessibility for people that use screen readers or have limited connectivity and help search engines understand what the content of an article is about or what product we are trying to sell.We simply know that media search is way too ignored for what it\u2019s capable doing for publishers so we\u2019re throwing more engineers at it as well as more outreach.\u00a0Gary Illyes, Google's Chief of Sunshine and Happiness &amp; trends analystLet\u2019s start with the basic of Image SEO with this historical video from Matt Cutts that, back in 2007, explained to webmasters worldwide the importance of descriptive alt text in images.https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&amp;v=3NbuDpB_BTcGoogle's Image SEO Best Practices In 2023If you want to understand how images work on Google, I would suggest also watching John Mueller\u2019s latest video on SEO for Google Images.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfC27XgelgE&amp;t=4sTo summarize, here are the key issues highlighted in Google\u2019s recent update of its documentation for image SEO:Addition of \u201cWhen possible, use filenames that are short, but descriptive.\u201c, more emphasis on avoiding generic filenames and removing the need to translate filenames - in line with John Mueller\u2019s advice.From \u201cchoosing\u201d to \u201cwriting\u201d ALT text - a small change that could be referring to having human-curated ALTs for web accessibility rather than automated and \u201cchosen\u201d ALTs for the benefit of search engines (one of the reasons we are focusing on this area).Replaced the example.jpg with a descriptive filename example maine-coon-nap-800w.jpg.The credit for spotting this update fully goes to @roxanastingu (head of SEO in Alamy).\u00a0https://twitter.com/roxanastingu/status/1620738018742239232?&nbsp;What is Agentive SEOIn WordLift we build agentive technologies for digital marketers. I had the pleasure of meeting Christopher Noessel in San Francisco and learned from him the principles of agentive technology (Chris has written a terrific book that I recommend you to read called Designing Agentive Technologies). One of the most critical aspects of designing agentive tech is to focus on efficient workflows to augment human intelligence with the power of machines by considering the strengths and limitations of today\u2019s AI.I have been working on this specific task for several years now. I have seen the evolution of deep learning models, vision APIs, and procedures dealing with image and natural language processing. I started in 2020 using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) that extracted the features of the input image. This feature vector was sent to an RNN/LSTM network for language generation.In 2023 with the advent of Generative AI technology, we can introduce completely new workflows that leverage the power of transformer-based models trained on multimodal content. The technology we use has dramatically improved.How To Enrich Image Alt Text On Your Website Using AIEvaluating language-vision modelsEvaluating automatic image captioning systems is not a trivial task. Still, it remains an exciting area of research, as human judgments might only sometimes correlate well with automated metrics.To find the best system, I worked on a small batch of images (50) and used my judgment (as I worked on a domain I was familiar with) to rank the different models. Below is an example of the output provided by a selection of models when analyzing the image on the right.I am generally less interested in the model and more interested in finding the proper framework to work on the different tasks using different models. While running these analyses, I found a modular and extensible library by Salesforce called LAVIS for language-vision AI.Introducing LAVIS (short for LAnguage-VISion)LAVIS is a library for language-vision intelligence written in Python to help AI practitioners create and compare models for multimodal scenarios, such as image captioning and visual inferencing.\u00a0LAVIS is easy to use and provides access to over 30 pre-trained and task-specific fine-tuned model checkpoints of four popular foundation models: ALBEF, BLIP, CLIP, and ALPRO.\u00a0While testing different models in LAVIS, I decided to focus on BLIP2, a contrastive model pre-trained for visual question answering (VQA).\u00a0These systems combine the ability to extract features from images provided by BLIP2 with frozen large language models such as Google\u2019s T5 or Meta\u2019s OPT. A frozen language model is a pre-trained language model with its parameters fixed and can no longer be updated.In NLP, this term is commonly used to refer to models used for specific tasks such as text classification, named entity recognition, question answering, etc. These models can be fine-tuned by adding a few layers to the top of the pre-trained network and training these layers on a task-specific dataset. Still, the underlying parameters remain frozen and do not change during training. The idea behind this approach is to leverage the knowledge and understanding of language learning by the pre-trained model rather than starting from scratch for each new task.\u00a0Running The Workflow For Automatic Image CaptioningIn this experiment, we proceed by analyzing a selection of the editorial images taken from the homepage of fila.com (not a client of ours, I used it already in the past for the e-commerce internal linking analysis).These images are particularly challenging as they don\u2019t belong to a specific product or category of products but help communicate the brand\u2019s feelings. By improving the alt text, we want to make the homepage of fila.com more accessible to people with visual disabilities. Web accessibility deeply interconnects with SEO.The code is accessible and described in a Colab Notebook. We proceed as follows:We start with Google Sheets (here), where we store information on the media files we want to analyze. We use the gspread library to read and write back to Google Sheets.We run the Colab (you will need Colab Pro+ if you want to run the tests on the different options, otherwise, use the simpler model, and you might be able to run it also on a CPU)We run a validation of the data and some minimal data cleaning (the work here is brief, but in production, you will need to get more into the details).To ensure the text doesn\u2019t contain any inappropriate content, we use the OpenAI moderation end-point. You will need to add your OpenAI key.We also work on rewriting the brand name (from \u201cfila\u201d to \u201cFILA\u201d). This is purely an example to show you that once you have the caption, more can be done by leveraging, for example, the information on the page, such as the title and the meta description or any other editorial rule.We can now add back the descriptions in Google Sheets, and from there, we will add them to the content management system.Content moderationWhen dealing with brands, we must protect the customer's relationship. Automating SEO using ChatGPT is fascinating and highly accessible. Still, when starting a project like setting up a model for automating image captioning, I usually receive the following question \u201cis it safe to use AI?\u201d.\u00a0We must be cautious and protect the client\u2019s website against possible misuse of the language. The minimum we can do is work with a moderation endpoint like the one provided by OpenAI for free. It uses a GPT-based classifier, is constantly updated, and helps us detect and filter undesired content. As we can see from the code snippet below, if we send the first caption being generated, we expect the moderation endpoint to return \u201cFalse\u201d; when trying instead with a violent sentence like the one below, we expect to receive \u201cTrue.\u201dKeep on reading if you are interested in Visual Question Answering experiments or simply access to the code developed while working for one of the clients of our SEO management services.Get Comfortable With ExperimentsMachine learning requires a new mindset different from our traditional programming approach. You tend to write less code and focus most of the attention on the data for training the model and the validation pipeline. Validation is essential to ensure that the AI content is aligned with the brand's tone of voice and compliant with SEO and content guidelines.\u00a0Don\u2019t Settle For Less Than The Best ModelRarely in our industry can we safely opt for the trendiest model or the most popular API. Setting up your own pipeline for training an ML model, if you are building a product that thousands of people will benefit from is always the recommended path. I could quickly evaluate the results from BLIP, BLI2-OPT, and BLIP2-T5 out of the box using LAVIS. Here below, you can find the percentage of accurate captions generated by each model.As you can see, based on the human judgment of our SEO team, we generated a suitable caption 71.6% of the time. This percentage dramatically increased as we introduced some basic validation rules (like the rewriting of the brand name from \u201cfila\u201d to \u201cFILA\u201d). These simple adjustments and the fine-tuning of the model typically help us bring the percentage of success above 90%.Visual Question Answering (VQA)Using LAVIS, we can also experiment with more advanced use cases like VQA: a computer vision task where given a text-based question about an image, the system infers the answer. Let\u2019s review it in action using one of the sample images.As we can see, the model recognizes and highlights the FILA logo (at least one of the two) in the image.ConclusionsExperimenting in ML is essential in today\u2019s SEO automation workflows. Many resources, including pre-trained machine learning models and frameworks like LAVIS, can encode knowledge to help us in SEO tasks.Below we can appreciate the evolution of the technology and how an image of\u00a0 Bill Slawski (whom I miss a lot \ud83c\udf39) alongside a young Neil Patel is captioned now and how it was captioned a few years back.\u00a0How I Worked A Few Years AgoHere follows how this workflow was originally implemented back in 2019. I left the text untouched as a form of AI-powered SEO archeology to help us study the evolution of the techniques.\u00a0Report from the first experiments on automatic image captioning using CNN and LSTMArmed with passion and enthusiasm I set up a model for image captioning roughly following the architecture outlined in the article \u201cAutomatic Image Captioning using Deep Learning (CNN and LSTM) in PyTorch\u201c that is based on the results published in the \u201cShow and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator\u201d paper by Vinyals et al., 2014.The implementation is based on a combination of two different networks:A pre-trained resnet-152 model that acts as an encoder. It transforms the image into a vector of features that is sent to the decoderA decoder that uses an LSTM network (LSTM stands for Long short-term memory, and it is a Recurrent Neural Network) to compose the phrase that describes the featured vector received from the encoder. LSTM, I learned along the way, is used by Google and Alexa for speech recognition. Google also uses it in Google Assistant and in Google Translate.One of the main datasets used for training in image captioning is called COCO and is made of a vast number of images; each image has 5 different captions that describe it. I quickly realized that training the model on my laptop would have required almost 17 days of non-stop with the CPU running at full throttle. I had to be realistic and downloaded the available pre-trained model.RNNs for sure, are not hardware friendly and use enormous resources for training.Needless to say, I remained speechless as soon as everything was in place, and I was ready to make the model talk for the first time. By providing the image below, the result was encouraging.Unfortunately, as I moved forward with the experiments and from the giraffes moved into a more mundane scenery (the team in the office) the results were bizarre, to use a euphemism, and far from being usable in our competitive SEO landscape.Last but not least: Image SEO ResolutionAnother important aspect of images in SEO is resolution. Large images, in multiple formats (1:1, 4:3 and 16:9) are needed by Google to present content in carousels, tabs (rich results on multiple devices) and Google Discover. This is done using structured data and following some important recommendations.\u00a0WordLift automatically creates the three versions required by Google for each image, as long as you have at least 1,200 pixels on the smaller side of the image. Since this isn't always possible, we've trained a model that can enlarge and enhance the images on your website using the Super-Resolution technique for images.\u00a0This is the AI-powered Image Upscaler and if you want to learn more about it, how to use it for your image and what results you can get, you can read our article.\u00a0References\u00a0Google image SEO best practicesDesigning Agentive Technology - Christopher NoesselMeet LAVIS: A One-stop Library for Language-Vision AI Research and Applications - Dongxu Li, Junnan Li, Steven Hoi, Donald RoseAutomatic Image Captioning using Deep Learning (CNN and LSTM) in PyTorch - JalFaizy ShaikhShow and Tell: A Neural Image Caption Generator - Oriol Vinyals, Alexander Toshev, Samy Bengio, Dumitru Erhan - Cornell UniversityDeep Residual Learning for Image Recognition - Kaiming He, Xiangyu Zhang, Shaoqing Ren, Jian Sun - Cornell UniversityLearning to Evaluate Image Captioning - Yin Cui, Guandao Yang, Andreas Veit, Xun Huang, Serge Belongie -\u00a0Cornell UniversityBLIP-2: Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training with Frozen Image Encoders and Large Language Models - Junnan Li, Dongxu Li, Silvio Savarese, Steven Hoi - Cornell UniversityLearn more about SEO image optimization, see our last web story.[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

Even the websites that are not registered as news sites with Google have a (small) chance to appear in the carousel. In other words, blogs and other sources can be included.Let me be clear: I\u2019m not saying that it is easy for blogs to get a spot. It is possible, but being registered as a news site helps a lot as you will learn by reading further.&nbsp;As stated in this blog post, Google also features notable quotes and opinion pieces.

Enable AMP A top stories carousel is presented in the Google Developers Guide as a Search Feature that requires AMP implementation. So you need to support AMP on your website either as a native or paired mode. Unless you are starting to develop a new project from scratch you are going to use AMP in paired mode. This basically means that you are reusing the active theme's templates to display AMP responses. With this configuration, AMP uses a separate URL, whether the canonical URLs for your site will not have AMP. You can use the AMP Test Tool to ensure that your pages comply with Google Search requirements for AMP.Update: Google has announced that in 2021 it is going to launch the Page Experience Update. As it will go live, AMP will no longer be a requirement for the top stories section. In 2020, Google has already experimented with not-AMP news on the news carousel, primarily related to COVID-19 updates.&nbsp;Anyway, unless your website is hugely performant in terms of speed, AMP is still an excellent choice to serve mobile users with a better experience. 1a. Comply with AMP logo guidelinesYou need to make sure that the logo used to represent the publisher used in the structured data from AMP fits in a 60x600px rectangle, and either be exactly 60px high (preferred), or exactly 600px wide. A logo 450x45px would not be acceptable, even though it fits within the 600x60px rectangle.Remember also when you have a logo with a solid background to include 6px minimum padding around it. Wanna see an example? Here is WordLift Publisher\u2019s logo.2. Use structured data to markup your articlesGoogle describes the news carousel as \u201ca container that includes articles, live blogs, and videos\u201d and what helps Google understand the content on the page is the required structured data. So the second step is to make sure that you are supporting one of the following schema types:ArticleNewsArticle (subtype of Article)BlogPosting (subtype of Article)LiveBlogPosting (subtype of BlogPosting)DiscussionForumPosting (subtype of Article)VideoObject (subtype of Article)You may also want to use one of these structured data testing tool to validate your markup. 2a. When in paired mode, make sure to have the same structured data on both canonical and AMP pagesDepending on how you are generating your AMP, you might end up, as it happened to several of our clients, with a different structured data markup on your canonical and AMP pages. This shall be prevented; it is inconsistent and can stop Google from showing your articles in the top stories carousel (we learned the lesson the hard way). The indication about using the same markup is provided in the Google AMP guide. WordLift is fully compatible with the AMP Plugin (developed by Google, Automattic, and XWP), and AMP pages can inherit the schema.org markup of the canonical page and share the same JSON-LD. Read all about how to add structured data markup to AMP here.3. Use multiple large images in your markupGoogle in the article schema guide for AMP articles requires to provide, in the structured data markup, images that are at least 1.200 pixels wide and that have 800.000 pixels in total. This is not all - the guides also specify, that for best results, publishers shall provide multiple high-resolution images with the following aspect ratios: 16x9, 4x3, and 1x1.To learn more about Super-Resolution for images and try our AI-powered Image Upscaler for free, I recommend you to read our latest article. You can understand how to enlarge and enhance images from your website to improve structured data markup by using a state-of-the-art deep learning model.&nbsp;[caption id=\"attachment_9871\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"662\"] Aaron Bradley spotted it first, and it is indeed essential[/caption]3a. Keep the main content always at the center of your imagesYou can use a 'universal image format' that will work across multiple devices and in all social circumstances with automatic cropping (square, 16:9 4:3 or 16:10). To do so, it's essential to always keep the core of your image at the very center of it. See it here how Jason Barnard does it for his podcast. ?[caption id=\"attachment_13363\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"2560\"] How to design your images to work with automatic cropping.[/caption]3b. Be specific when describing your imagesAlt-text is essential and should be as specific as possible to describe images to visitors who cannot see them.It is an essential aspect of accessible web design, and it is also strategic for image SEO. Google strives to index and to serve high-quality and accessible content to its users, and we shall do our best to support this process.In the US, we heard of a case where a website did not appear on Top Stories until they improved the alt text on the featured images (the main image of the article). They were (as many publishers do) re-using the title of the page as alt text.While this might work, in some rare cases, it is not considered an accessible practice and should be avoided.4. Remember that being part of Google News is not required, but... it helps a lot! Google can feature any article matching the above criteria in the top stories carousel based on its organic algorithmic selection,&nbsp;but... the reality is slightly different. Let\u2019s see why:The Top Stories Carousel is indeed a SERP feature that evolved from the Google News box, and it now serves the same goal, The main difference is that the top stories carousel's content should NOT be restricted to outlets Google News approved. The truth is that, as a result of the \"fake news\" scandal that exploded in November 2016, Google has removed less-than-reliable sources (and smaller sites that are not in Google News) from the top stories carousel. NewsDashboard published data showing that more than 99% of desktop news box results and 97% of mobile news box results are from Google News sites.So unless you have the authority of Reddit, Yoast, and similar websites, there are many more chances for you to land in the news box if you are Google News approved. If you want to dig deeper into Top Stories and Google News\u2019 relationship,&nbsp;go follow this thread on the Google News Help Forum.4a. Follow the editorial guidelines of Google NewsGoogle provides news publishers with a set of content policies to ensure a positive experience for the readers. It is not only about being newsworthy and keep on writing fresh new content; it also about limiting advertising, preventing sponsored content, malicious links, or anything that can be considered hateful, offensive, or dangerous.Here you can find all the editorial criteria to follow and&nbsp;the recommendations that Danny Sullivan from Google provided in this post titled \"Ways to Succeed in Google News\".&nbsp;4b. Avoid article content errorsIn order to be featured in Google News, there are few technical aspects to be considered: Prevent article fragmentation. If you have isolated sentences that are not grouped into paragraphs, you might get an error, and your article will be rejected from Google News.Write articles that are not too short and not too long. It means to write more than 80 words and prevent your pages from being too long to read. We usually see that articles between 600-800 words are a good match for Google News.Make sure to write headlines of a maximum of 110 characters.Review all the article content errors that you need to avoid to be eligible for Google News.4c. Focus on original reporting&nbsp;Google has updated its news algorithm to focus more on originality as reported on September 13th, 2019 by the New York Times: Google Says a Change in Its Algorithm Will Highlight \u2018Original Reporting\u2019.&nbsp;It has also been also confirmed several times on the Google News Publisher Help Community.\"I would recommend doing more work, or more obvious work, on original reporting - fresh, new, original facts and information that isn't published elsewhere.\" Chris Andrews (Platinum Product Expert) answering a question related to Top Stories.&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Speed, Speed, and again SpeedNews readers want to be able to find fresh updates as fast as possible \u2014 and, especially on mobile, people&nbsp;care a lot about the speed of a page. A top story is a mobile SERP feature that is&nbsp;purely organic-driven. If you get to the top 5 results of Google, you can get it, and it will be an extra boost for your traffic. If you are not top ranking, you will not get your spot in the news carousel (in most cases).&nbsp; Starting in July 2018, page speed has become a ranking factor for all mobile searches, and this means that your website needs to be blazing fast.[wl_navigator]6. Show your E-A-T&nbsp;Google wants to give its users the best possible experience. Before anything else, this means giving them a set of results that can offer real value and can be trusted.&nbsp;Here is why E-A-T (acronym for Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) is important. It measures the capability of a specific author, source, or page to provide authentic value to the search engine\u2019s users.&nbsp;Working on E-A-T means taking care of a wide number of aspects that go from editorial choices in terms of transparency and method to media relations and the capacity of setting your brand as an authority. We will not cover all the parts of this meticulous job, but we would like to focus on a single and yet powerful aspect: Structured Data.&nbsp;As Lily Ray \u2014 who has devoted a lot of work and study to this topic \u2014 suggests, including structured data in your E-A-T strategy is a sure way to support and give strength to your overall effort. Using structured data, you will talk in the same language as Google, and all search engines will understand what you mean.&nbsp;To get featured in the Top Stories Carousel it is essential, in terms of E-A-T, to connect your content with its author. How should you do that?Markup your content with these entity types: Article, BlogPost, or NewsArticle&nbsp;Make sure you use the property Author to connect the piece of content to the person who wrote it.&nbsp;Create a Person entity for all your authors and make sure that the author property of each article recalls the corresponding Person entity.&nbsp;Enrich the entities of your authors with properties such as affiliation, jobTitle, and connect them to other trustable sources using the sameAs property.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To learn more about E-A-T and structured data, I recommend watching this webinar that analyses it from different perspectives.&nbsp;How to track when you have been featured in the Top Stories Tracking traffic generated from the Top Stories is not immediate. You can only do that by looking at specific queries from the Google Search Console, using third-party tools like Semrush, or RankRanger or look for specific patterns in Google Analytics. The simplest way I found is to start from the Google Search Console by filtering results for Rich Results and AMP Articles.[caption id=\"attachment_9874\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"600\"] Google Search Console configuration[/caption]When you see a spike, you can look from a mobile device for the related keyword and hopefully find the matching article. Remember also that a given result might only occur in a specific country. For example, this article was only visible from Google in the US, so we could only detect it by changing the territory in the Google Search preferences and using the incognito mode.From Google Analytics, we can also spot a top story by looking for a peak like the one below. As you can see, that spike, in most cases, is only there for a 48-72 hours maximum. &nbsp;[caption id=\"attachment_9876\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"221\"] Google Analytics for the article that entered the carousel.[/caption]Given the relationship between Google News and Top Stories, you might want to analyze these patterns by filtering top articles in Google News. You can do it easily&nbsp;in Google Analytics by knowing that &nbsp;Incoming readers with referrers of 'news.google.com' or 'news.url.google.com' are from Google News.Here is a quick overview of how to set the filters in the Organic Research tab of Semrush to check if you are featured or not. This is one of our happy clients (a large news organization in Italy) that followed our guidelines and entered the carousel in one month.It is also worth noticing that in a few days (less than one month), achieving this goal has generated an amount of traffic worth 8.300$.Once again there are plenty of SERP feature optimization chances that we can leverage on when combining structured data with more traditional SEO factors and, they do create an enormous difference for your audience reach.[et_bloom_inline optin_id=\"optin_6\"]This article was originally published on December 11th, 2018.

        "text": "Top 5 SEO Trends for 2023! 2023 is the year of the Generative Web (or Text-to-X if you like). The most significant shift in how we create, find, and consume content online. AI-generated content will be indistinguishable from human-generated content and has demonstrated in 2022 the potential to revolutionise journalism, SEO, and content marketing.&nbsp;&nbsp;\u201cI don't know what's going on. I don't understand anything except the rules for symbol manipulation. Now in this case I want to say that the robot has no intentional states at all; it is simply moving about as a result of its electrical wiring and its program. And furthermore, by instantiating the program I have no intentional states of the relevant type. All I do is follow formal instructions about manipulating formal symbols.\u201dJohn R. Searle - (1980) Minds, brains, and programs.We founded WordLift with the belief that websites would eventually be transformed into datasets, and that AI would assist us in navigating the vast global information ecosystem. Our goal is to continue making data accessible and easy to use for everyone, while empowering successful AI projects.&nbsp;SEO has changed forever as queries that would traditionally go to Google, are being intercepted by ChatGPT. This is happening at the speed of 1 million prompts per day.\u201cLLMO, or large language model optimization, is a term we coined to refer to ensuring your business information is mentioned within a large language model (LLM). One effective technique for this is in-context learning.\u201dHan Xiao and Alex C-G - Jina AIMore than ever, optimization techniques to increase demand for products and services are critical for businesses. SEO continues to evolve to accommodate the changing nature of search and the increasing use of Conversational AI. In our industry, we have long optimized for AI-specific ranking factors, such as a website's ability to provide a clear and coherent response to a given search query, or the use of structured data to make it easier for Google to understand and interpret a website's content, or even how to get into Google's Knowledge Graph. That was just the beginning. In 2023, things are changing at an unprecedented pace as generative technology delivers a new result for every new user, a new result for every problem, and at web scale. The game has begun and here are my predictions.In a nutshell:Automation and augmentation remain closely intertwined, and the ability to experiment with new optimization techniques such as in-context learning, instructions-based prompts, and other emerging behaviours of foundational models remains anchored to an extensible data fabric and brand authority.We build Knowledge Graphs to structure data, making it more flexible and easier for brands to interact with Generative Tech.WORKING RESPONSIBLY WITH AI SYSTEMS IS NOT AN OPTION: IT IS AN IMPERATIVE.Gary Marcus at EMNLP 2022 reminding us how LLMs are prone to factually incorrect information (a.k.a. \u201cfluent bullshit\u201d) - IF WE DO AI WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT ETHICSAs in previous years, I'd like to thank the amazing colleagues I work with, as well as our great clients and investors. These annual SEO trends are not only my predictions, but also the trends WordLift will focus on to ensure the success of our clients and the continued development of our platform.What Are The Top Trends For SEO In 2023?Here are the top 5 trends you need to watch in 2023:Generative ContentE-E-A-T and Structured DataMultimodal eCommerceIntent is kingRecession mode: game on1. Generative ContentGenerative tech has made significant strides in 2022, with advances in deep learning and natural language processing leading to the development of sophisticated AI systems that we have been able to use on a wide range of SEO tasks.The current state-of-the-art in many deep learning domains typically relies on three key components:Large, scalable architectures (such as those based on the Transformer)Head-based transfer learning where a generic head layer takes pre-trained representations to predict an output classPrompting where a task-specific pattern string is designed to coax the model into producing a textual output corresponding to a given class.These models can be applied to a variety of data types, including images, videos, and audio. In the area of AI-powered SEO, some of the most successful models we have used include BERT, RoBERTa, BART, DistillBERT, T5, and GPT-3 trained on billions of tokens of English text using masked language modeling techniques.I expect a strong acceleration in how external knowledge is incorporated into learning by enhancing prompting. We have tested multiple ways to expand words in prompts from a knowledge base (i.e., a taxonomy). Significant progress has been made on the research front by Liu et al. using an LM to generate relevant knowledge statements in a few-shot setting. Notable is the work of incorporating additional knowledge data by enhancing the training data using entity descriptions and entity types (see Arora et al.) or how in-context learning performance can be improved by providing a better explanation in prompts as proposed by Xi Ye et al.. In layman's terms, working with curated external data will help LLMs get smarter without sacrificing performance.We can also foresee that data is becoming the real bottleneck when training LMs. Jordan Hoffmann and the team at DeepMind introduced a 70B LM called \"Chinchilla\" that outperformed bigger LMs (GPT-3, Gopher) by scaling training data and not exclusively parameters. If adding more data helps improve the performances, we can understand why OpenAI is developing speech recognition systems like \"Whisper\" that can feed the otherwise severely starved and under-trained LMs with trillions of text tokens from YouTube or any Podcast available. More than general-domain data is needed; this will also apply to fine-tuning our custom models; I expect we will source more information from existing multimedia content.Under the pressure of more users moving to ChatGPT for different queries, Google will soon introduce its conversational AI machinery. I expect Google\u2019s attempt to take advantage of both the web index and E-E-A-T signals.By experimenting in 2022 with LLMs in SEOs, we have learned a few lessons that are shaping our way forward:We need to focus on fact-oriented information to bring value to the end user. Only by improving factual accuracy (Truthful AI), we can future-proof AI-generated content as Google improves its spam detection algorithms. The highest cost lies in building validation pipelines that can provide any brand with accurate information and the proper writing style and tone of voice.Fine-tuning and in-context learning are powerful approaches that can be made available to content creators and SEOs with effective feedback loops. When we adequately engaged the content team, we saved time and significantly improved quality.Prompt improvements can be obtained by comparing the visual similarity of synthetic images produced using text-to-image and CLIP. This is also an exciting line of research to follow in the coming months (see the visual entitlement work by Song et al.)Prompt improvement and verification by combining GPT-3 with DALL\u00b7E 2We are not Jasper (or any other off-the-shelf content generation tool that supports content writing); we are an SEO automation platform leveraging semantic data: to make an impact, we must wear our SEO hat first.The Generative Web is changing the way content is delivered to the end user; content exists in its unique form once it reaches the target audience. However, the need to organize content using entities remains. For example, look at the chain presented in the following thread and the limitations of AI systems that do not use knowledge graphs.https://twitter.com/cyberandy/status/1602646415632637954?s=20&amp;t=tkVZXiUSm6xFuW8zCP_5qgWe can see the same issue using the newly introduced chatbot (YouChat) on You.com. It is terrific and plausible, but unable to understand what it is talking about.YouChat by You.comIn-Context Learning ExplainedHere is an example of how injecting factual information in the prompt helps fine-tuning the result.This is Lily Ray\u2019s experiment (see here) that helps us understand the limitations of LMs.Takeaway:Ask yourself what data can make your prompts unique. In-context learning requires a clear understanding of entities; we need facts (triples) to add more context while prompting the model. The Generative AI starts here.Focus on strengthening the content validation pipeline; ensure that the tone of voice is always suitable for the brand.Be responsible when using AI and find the best feedback loop by joining forces with domain experts and content creators.2. E-E-A-T and Structured DataGoogle's content quality evaluation will get stricter as more synthetic content is created. LLMs will also be affected; their quality is at risk as they will be fed their own content from now on. Brand equity will grow in importance in 2023. Performance marketing, social media networks, and online advertising will lose traction as we move forward (TikTok might even get banned soon in the US). The proliferation of AI content adds noise to the searcher experience, and only strong brands will succeed and take full advantage of the opportunities offered by generative tech. Looking at the structured data types in your industry and building a solid plan will strengthen your brand. We have seen the importance (for eCommerce websites) of sophisticated Product and Review markup. It is best to have an error-free structured data implementation that guides the crawler and establishes the authority for the brand and its ambassadors (editors, content authors, and domain experts). The power of a brand will also depend on its ability to publish connected data at scale. Having structured and linked data, using identifiers, and having other data sources and websites citing products, places, events, and people is no longer a niche experiment; it is becoming a profitable strategy for many brands.&nbsp;&nbsp;Takeaway: Focus on your authority by connecting your data with other data. Design a flawless structured data strategy and follow Google\u2019s quality guidelines for content. They will be a lifesaver as you will embrace AI Content. Set up your off-site Structured Linked Data plan; it\u2019s link-building on steroids.3. Multimodal eCommerceSEO for eCommerce has evolved significantly in 2022, and Google has put greater emphasis on user experience and quality content to gain traction over Amazon. Additionally, the use of artificial intelligence in its algorithms (like the product review algorithm) and the introduction of the product knowledge graph panels require merchants to adapt their strategies to the evolving trends constantly. Even before the opening of ChatGPT and the \u201ccode red\u201d that Google is issuing to respond to OpenAI and Microsoft, eCommerce searches had become more conversational and multimodal.&nbsp;This has led to concrete opportunities for brands investing in creating a suitable knowledge base of question-and-answer pairs associated with products and product categories. Our success in automating the generation of FAQ content for eCommerce websites has been significant, with thousands of new snippets that brought double-digit sales growth. Our product here will continue to improve to be brighter at sifting through queries, fact-checking answers, and interacting with editors and SEOs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Generating product photography using Midjourney.With Google Lens receiving more than 8 billion queries per month, developing robust product visuals for the different SKUs is also becoming an imperative. MUM is naturally anticipating the next step on the searcher journey and images are, for most products, a key element.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we can see the uptake of 35.6% on the clicks on the variant group with the enhanced markup where we improved both quality and quantity of the images associated with the Product Markup.We also must consider the interplay between Google Lens and local search, as users can now search images and text combined to find products from local retailers. It\u2019s an excellent opportunity to show the importance of a solid structured data strategy emphasising data linking.A new opportunity is made available with Google\u2019s multisearch \u201cnear me\u201d queries.As we convert products into entities for the product knowledge graph, I can also see the value of improving the semantic annotations for images and bringing full support for 3D models recently introduced in Google search for sneakers and other product types.Annotating images will be an important optimization task.The drivers behind Multimodal eCommerce are also represented by the evolution of smart glasses and AR/VR experiences that are slowly entering the market.&nbsp;Takeaway: Invest in AI workflows to develop comprehensive product images, improve image resolution when needed, experiment with text-to-image and image-to-image foundational models to build the proper context for your products, and work on image annotations. A robust strategy for image annotation will allow your organization to gain additional visibility on search and help you fine-tune contrastive models like CLIP for visual inference.4. Intent Is KingFoundational model-based recommendation systems accelerate content discovery by providing users with personalized content based on their search history and interests. I expect an increase in queryless traffic as users will need less to enter specific keywords or phrases to find relevant content. Instead, the recommendations are generated by pre-emptively predicting the user intent. As seen in previous years, traffic from Google Discover will represent a valuable stream of clicks, as it originates from users actively interested in the recommended content. Intent detection using LLMs will enable a new wave of recommendation tools besides Google Discover and Microsoft Start. The ability to interact more directly with search engines like You.com will let publishers and brands craft the user experience when their core entities are being searched.The ability to augment search results and recommendations inside You.com is exciting: \u201cBuild Your Own Panel\u201d!Takeaway: Develop new traffic streams, optimize for Google Discover, and look for emerging platforms to expose content and products in new and innovative ways. Building apps inside Social Networks, Search Engines, or Chatbot platforms will be an important trend to follow.5. Recession Mode: Game OnAfter a sustained period of slow economic growth, the end of the pandemic, and the war in Ukraine, we are facing a global recession with high unemployment, low consumer confidence, and declining business investment. The economic hardship and the decline in investment in risky assets have also led to the cryptocurrency crisis. These are difficult times, but I am confident that the digital economy in general will show some resilience. As they cut advertising spending, more companies will also turn to organic growth. In the SEO space (or the new LLMO arena where we optimize data for GPT-4 and the like), we need to focus on two things: 1) doing more with less through automation and 2) investing in solid reporting. Digital marketing needs to prove its value to the bottom line, and we can leverage AI for better SEO predictions, causal impact analysis, and A/B testing. If we can not deliver at least a 3x increase in value (for every dollar spent, our approach or technology brings in at least $3 in revenue), we are not the right partner. To be successful, you must constantly introduce new ideas and strategies. If you do not innovate, you are much more likely to become irrelevant. 2023 is the year of the productivity boost. We can quickly solve problems that slow us down with just a few lines of code, a small prompt, or no code at all. It's a dream come true, and it's enabling a new wave of small tools that will change the way we work forever.Takeaway: Improve your reporting skills and tooling, look extensively at the business impact that SEO and digital marketing creates. As less investment can be made, remain lean and embrace open innovation. Companies will need a stream of innovation. Be ready to incorporate ideas, technologies, and knowledge from outside your organization.Are you ready to innovate on SEO in 2023? Still have a question?

        "text": "How we boosted our traffic by 504.17% with a SEO-Friendly Web Story Google Web Stories are a web-based version of the famous \"Stories\" format that we see on social networking apps like Instagram and TikTok. This new format allows anyone to easily create short, engaging, and dynamic content, which is then playable across any browser on the Open Web.&nbsp;This blog post is also available as Web Story ?&nbsp; \"SEO-Friendly Web Story\"How do I create an SEO-friendly Web Story?Here are my tips for boosting your traffic using Web Stories:Create a Web Story for your top ranking articlesUse jump-links to connect the Web Story with the key passages of your articleAdd numbers to each step of the Web Story and be conciseCover one topic with multiple anglesUse videos and animations to communicate the messageLet Google index your StoryBe authentic and provide clear byline and information about the authorAn extra tip for finding more ideas.As part of Google's commitment to making the Web more visually appealing and engaging, Web Stories have been recently promoted in the United States, India, and Brazil at the top of Discover. I have experimented with several clients throughout 2020 with this new format and, by the end of this year, I decided to create my first Web Story on this blog to present my SEO predictions. Here is what happened and why you should keep reading this blog post.My Web Story went viral on Google Discover (not sure if we can talk about virality in Discover's context, but you got my point): in a few days, traffic went up on our website by 504%. For our small website (we began working as a company in 2017), this is by far the most successful piece of content we ever had. And, yes, proudly I can say that Google's John Mueller liked it too ?https://twitter.com/JohnMu/status/1341879877138604038?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwWhile this is the first of its kind, I had the privilege of contributing to a few other successful Web Stories for our VIP clients and have learned enough about optimizing content for Google Discover to share a few tips.Clicks generated by my SEO Trends Web Story on Google Discover in a week.1. Create a Web Story for your top ranking articlesA Web Story is a short, easy to consume piece of content that uses visual, slideshow-like content to summarize something that you know well. A Web Story is for your top ranking blog post what a trailer is for a movie: a smartly composed selection of \"shots\" that can inspire your readers to find out about your article. Google will trust your Web Story since it already ranks your blog post (or web page) on that topic. Moreover, there is no risk of cannibalization\u2014quite the contrary. The Web Story is intertwined with the article, and Google does a fantastic job contributing to both.https://twitter.com/cyberandy/status/1342001396766400512?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwHow do I create a Web Story?&nbsp;There are two options, really:&nbsp;You can use a 3d party tool like MakeStories, Newsroom AI or if you are using WordPress as your CMS, Google's Web Stories Editor (here is the perfect Web Story to get you started).&nbsp;Or you can code it yourself by following guidelines and tutorials on the AMP website.Here is Google\u2019s Web Story plugin for WordPress2. Use jump-links to connect the Web Story with the key passages of your articleThe more we link the Web Story with the article behind it, the more we help our readers find what they need the most.&nbsp;In today's era of information explosion, content fragmentation is a prominent characteristic and a fantastic opportunity. If we can quickly drive our reader where he/she finds the highest value from our content, our mission is really accomplished. Practically speaking, this means creating a direct link from every frame of your Story to your article's relevant section. It seems easy, but it does require a solid outline in your blog post.&nbsp;How do I create a jump-link from my Web Story?Practically speaking, you create a jump-link, using Google's web story editor for WordPress, by adding the URL in the \"Link\" section (see below). Here you will add the link that points directly to the internal section of the webpage.Here is an example, click on this link, and you will jump directly to the next section of this article. This is the type of link that you will use inside your Story.&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Add numbers to each step of the Web Story and be conciseWe want to add numbers 1-2-3-4-5-6 to each step of our Story to help users understand the position and increase the content scannability. We want our content to be super easy to read and, yes - a good story doesn't have too much content for each slide - keeping things easy to read in less than 10 seconds is a good practice. We want to be straightforward, easy to be read, and essential. Large blocks of text don't work.&nbsp;To summarize this article and condense it into a Web Story, I used our WordLift's automatic text summarizer ? .&nbsp;[et_pb_section global_module=\"13757\"][/et_pb_section]4. Cover one topic with multiple anglesImagine the traffic on Google Discover to be organized around user interests. We know that predictive search in Google leverages the so-called Topic Layer in the Knowledge Graph to understand user interests. While it is vital to tap into an exact knowledge domain, we want to feed Google News AI/ML with content that brings various perspectives on the given topic. So if my topic is SEO, writing a story on the upcoming trends is a great way to be interesting for a wider audience. Each trend might capture the attention of a different audience segment within that same context.Here is a brilliant research work that Abby Hamilton did on user interests to get an idea of how the topic layer works. Keep in mind that the data is biased. Abby shared a questionnaire with the SEO community - for this reason, SEO is a larger topic than it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;5. Use videos and animations to communicate the messageLike any movie trailer, you need to condense complex meanings in a short, engaging sequence. Reducing thousands of words in a compelling slideshow requires all the magic that you can think of. From animating objects separately to using full-screen video backgrounds, try always to be interesting and thoughtful (use all the pixels you have, but never waste your readers' attention span).&nbsp; &nbsp;6. Let Google index your StoryAs simple as it sounds, indexing is still challenging, especially when you try new things. Here is what we can do to let Google find our stories.&nbsp;Add direct links to the Web Story from its related article; embedding is also an option but a less valid one: it will slow down your article and collapse both pieces into one URL. A link is always preferable.&nbsp;Add a dedicated sitemap for Web Stories. Yoast does an excellent job at managing sitemaps, including the one that you need for Web Stories. Here is an example of the&nbsp; web-story-sitemap.xml (from our website)Add a navigation link (from your homepage, from the footer menu, or anywhere else you like) to the Web Story landing page. This page is typically located under yourwebsite.com/web-stories/ that feature links to all of your Web Stories.&nbsp;Link your stories one to another. We might guess that if a user likes the first one, they might like similar content of the same kind.&nbsp;&nbsp;7. Be authentic and provide clear byline and information about the authorGoogle's automated systems carefully select content based on expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness (E-A-T).

        "text": "The Power of Product Knowledge Graph for E-commerce This post is part of a series that dives deep into the power of data for e-commerce. You can find the other posts here:The Power of Product Knowledge Graph for E-commerceTouch your SEO: Introducing Physical SEOThe GS1 Digital Link explained for SEO Jedis (and their clients)The Only Thing Missing in Your Omnichannel E-commerce Strategy is\u2026With the supersonic development of the technologies users have access to, there is so much more to e-commerce these days than buying and selling online. Efficient strategies for user engagement and customer retention are those that put at the centre of e-commerce the user - the empowered user brands are striving to build meaningful and smooth experiences for. On the Web, as much as these memorable experiences are related to the creativity of the editorial content, they are also inextricably linked to the data behind this content.Think of it, on the Web the interactions between a user and a business are also interactions between a user\u2019s data and an enterprise\u2019s data. The reason that matters for e-commerce is that when thinking about attracting customers to your \u201cvirtual window\u201d you need to also consider the data underpinnings of their journey towards your product. How are your product pages connected? Are they represented in a universal way for other machine applications to read them? Are they also interlinked to other products, to editorial content, generally to knowledge outside your website or to knowledge?Meet Joe: The social customer struggling to connect the dots of your e-commerce contentMeet Joe! Your social, truly empowered customer. Being connected and having realised that he can ask more from companies and know more within a couple of clicks, Joe\u2019s expectations throughout his customer journey are rising. Yet, no matter the fact that he has lots of tools to engage with a brand or navigate information to satisfy a need, he is still struggling.&nbsp;He jumps across multiple sites, checks for inventory, checks for product availability, delivery, details. In a nutshell Joe does all the leg work which, as you will see, you and your relevant data strategy, can spare him.An experience map showing opportunities to meet visitor needs both inside and outside a museum.Orchestrating Experiences: Collaborative Design for Complexity, Risdon, Quattlebaum, 2018, New York: Rosenfeld MediaIf we take a closer look at the touchpoints and the activities of Joe, we will see that the question of engagement and consistency, especially when it comes to e-commerce&nbsp; interactions and transactions is a question of providing data that is required for platforms to understand what we are selling to Joe and what content Joe needs across his journey.&nbsp;As we see from the exhaustive customer journey map the authors of Orchestrating experiences took the time and consideration to create, this is not about one single, discrete search. It is about multiple steps during which Joe will come back several times before making the final move of purchase: he would look for customers' feedback, qualified reviews, imagery, FAQs, advertising and a lot more before making the transaction. That means that all our e-commerce content and data need to be in sync across all the platforms, devices and spaces (Google Shopping, Google Search, Google Image Search, Bing Shopping) Joe visits.And it is at that challenging point where the power of a product knowledge graph for e-commerce comes into play.Getting data right. With a Product Knowledge Graph.A Product Knowledge Graph is an e-commerce specific form of knowledge graph built to improve product findability and end-user experiences by enriching a brand\u2019s content with data. It consists of data about products, brands, product categories, product features, reviews, hi-res images, shipping data, FAQs and a lot more. Made of structured data and extended product mark-up, injected across both editorial and product content, a product knowledge graph is built on top of the product database to link all data together combining both structured information, (for instance, the list of products for a brand) or unstructured (for example the descriptions related to a collection of products).&nbsp;Simply put, a Product Knowledge graph bridges the currently existing gap (hindering Joe\u2019s smooth experience and our brand's opportunities to connect to Joe where he most needs it) between product content and editorial content.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider this scenario: Joe, the empowered customer we met above, is looking for new sunglasses. The ones that he bought before do not suit his new exercise routine - running. So he tries to get some models that might fit his needs. He is not aware that there are special models of sunglasses that are created for running, yet he is very well aware of his need - glasses that fit well, don\u2019t bounce up and down, are water resistant, maybe with high UV protection etc.&nbsp;So here\u2019s Joe, starting his navigation on the Web with a query.&nbsp;He might try to search for tips for running with sunglasses. Or what models of sunglasses fit best for running. What unites all these queries is their navigational nature. That is, their essence implies the intent of Joe - not to buy right away but to explore various options. In contrast, transactional queries would look differently, this is where Joe will know what he is searching and will be now comparing prices and quality and availability. These two different queries (with a different intent behind them) map the uneven, meandering way Joe, or any other given person, reaches a product.&nbsp;In the context of e-commerce, it is our goal (if we want to share with Joe the information and the products we have and offer in a meaningful way) to link our editorial content (the one that explains what models of sunglasses are good for running, what types of these models exist for what kind of running and what are the benefits of having glasses for running, etc.) to purely transactional information, such as prices, availability, types, product number, payment methods, delivery information.And this is exactly what a Product Knowledge Graph does for our data and clients. It makes possible the curation and creation of editorial content as a network of data which you serve not only to Joe (and customers) but also to different types of machine applications that Joe (and other customers and leads and prospects) use to navigate your content (search engines, chatbots, personal assistants etc.). As an example, think about the Product Knowledge Panel in Google, probably the most dynamic and smart rich snippet on the search result pages. Building a Product Knowledge Graphs allows you to show information-rich Content Cards with a link to any product you mention in your articles, tutorials, listicles, and, in short, in any kind of content page on your website.Learn how to build a product knowledge graph from your merchant feed to get more traffic on Google and search engines. Okay, You Got a Product Knowledge Graph and Now What?What a Product Knowledge Graph knowledge does for e-commerce websites can be summarized in three general benefits (the ones users will thank you for!)Visibility &amp; SEOImmersive contentInteroperability.To unpack these, let\u2019s look at each and connect them to smooth customer experience on one side and well connected data on the other side.Visibility: How structured data helps people (and search engines) \u201csee\u201d you?The reason a Product Knowledge Graph makes your content visible is because it gives it machine-readable descriptions that are highly interlinked. Just like Google Knowledge Graph.The Product Knowledge Graph though is not a knowledge graph, as it is not generic, but well targeted to a specific need: discoverability. It is a dedicated graph built to provide answers with the ultimate goal of being robot-readable. Focused on discoverability, a Product Knowledge Graph allows you to level up your ecommerce marketing through providing the data structure for hyper-targeted content, richly interlinked content, enriched with product.Immersive content: why content needs data as to power better user experiences?&nbsp;In order for content to create the immersive environments we all want, it needs not only the editorial touch but also a way for content to be assembled dynamically and thoroughly connected.The Product Knowledge Graph, for example, connects blog posts with products and product categories.&nbsp;Thus you can build all kinds of meaningful content experiences. For example, a Navigator and Product Faceted Search, can help your user navigate seamlessly editorial content and at the point when they are ready painlessly move to buying what they decided to, instantly seeing prices, prices, availability, types, delivery information, etc.The Product Navigator of WordLift for WooCommerceInteroperability: How to use data to sell more?Like any enterprise these days, e-commerce activities are more and more dependent on working with data that can be easily shared across different devices, platforms, softwares.

This flow was described by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. It is a state where we are completely absorbed by what we are doing and in which we fully involved with the activity at hand, feeling engaged, fulfilled and rewarded.&nbsp;And&nbsp;in the 1990s the flow was wisely linked to the shift marketing communications are going through in hypermedia environments. According to the researchers Novak and Hoffman, flow characterizes virtually every aspect of the interaction between the user and the environments they navigate through hypermedia. It is this concept of flow that&nbsp;can help an e-commerce website stand out by providing information and value. A flow which is efficiently facilitated for the user through the smart use of linked, interoperable data - to cater for the needs of human users and their machine applications.Curious to know more about Product Knowledge Graphs?

        "text": "Why Structured Data for E-Commerce Can Make or Break Your Sales 2022 is a turning point for e-commerce SEONothing like search marketing can impact your e-commerce traffic and sales. If you are an e-commerce owner \u2014 or an e-commerce manager \u2014 you know that SEO is a key factor to drive sales, especially if paid traffic is too expensive. This year we are at a turning point: in fact, in 2022 using structured data has really become crucial to get the best exposure on Google. For free. Here is what happened: back in April this year, Bill Ready, President of Commerce at Google, made an announcement that was going to change the game rules for e-commerce owners. Its title was loud and clear: It's now free to sell on Google. The core message in there was:Search results on the Google Shopping tab will consist primarily of free listings, helping merchants better connect with consumers, regardless of whether they advertise on Google.After a few months, Bill published another important announcement: free retail listings landed on Google Search. Now, we\u2019re bringing free listings to the main Google Search results page in the U.S., helping shoppers choose the products and sellers that will serve them best, from the widest variety of options.Boom! That's really a game-changer. It allows e-commerce sites to get more exposure for their products and increase the CTR. How can you get into Google's Free Product Listings?Here is where structured data comes in handy. Adding a layer of metadata to all your products allows Google to display them to potential customers. So, here is the real question: how do you add structured data to your products?In this article, I will show you how to use structured data to get organically into Google's free product listings and also how to benefit from the same technology to gently push your users to shift from informational pages to product pages.Why Google is selling your goods for freeLet's take a few steps back and set the context. Behind this openness, of course, Big G is chasing its own interests. When looking for a product, often users go straight to Amazon's search box and skip Google search. In 2018, research published by Jumpshot found that Amazon, with 54% of the market share, took over Google in terms of product search. For Google, that's an issue. Amazon Vs Google in the product search battleAdvertising money and sales need to stay on the same track. To put it simply, in order to collect more money from advertisers that want to sell their products, Google needs more traffic made by users that specifically search for products. On the other side, users tend to choose Amazon because it has a larger and well-organized offer of products. In the product search battle, Google is competing with Jeff Bezos' war machine. Some argue that even if more product searches take place directly within Amazon, Google is still an important source of traffic for all online retailers, including Amazon. Keep this in mind, because we are going to dive deeper into this specific aspect in the next paragraphs. To overcome its most feared competitor Google needs to showcase more products \u2014 and to escalate its capacity, what Big G needs, in the end, is to have more data.That's why Mountain View's giant is opening its doors to free product listing. In the long-run the data about products provided by e-commerce websites will help Google win the product search battle. What's in it for you?On the bright side, between two parties, the third gain. And in this fight between two giants, e-commerce sites of all sizes are going to earn free visibility and better exposure if they play their cards well. Implementing (or improving) structured data on your e-commerce is the way to win more visibility for your products on Google's SERP, get a higher CTR from organic search, and ultimately close more sales.What is structured data for e-commerce?In the context of SEO for e-commerce, structured data is a specific piece of code that follows the standards of schema.org and allows search engines to understand and classify the content of your web pages, identify your products and their specific features, and easily interact with the content architecture of your website.Using structured data impacts SEO results because&nbsp;schema.org markup makes your content eligible for specific rich results and&nbsp;SERP&nbsp;features such as Google's Free Product Listings&nbsp;\u2014 which help your pages gain a higher CTR. The advantages of structured data go far beyond SEO, and also include opportunities of content reuse, internal findabilty, and&nbsp;semantic analytics. But, let's start from the SERP. How does structured data for e-commerce look like in the SERP?Adding structured data to your products allows you to be eligible for Google Merchant and, therefore, to get into Google's Product Listings. How your products look like on the SERP depends on how deep and accurate your data is. With lack of structured data, your product looks poor. But when you add structured data, it\u2019s another story. Product features and categories, rating, availability, and other relevant information create an informative rich snippet that helps your product stand out in the crowded Google Shopping page. Think at structured data as a special trick to grab the user\u2019s attention and improve your CTR.As you can see in the screenshot above, accurate and complete structured data results in exhaustive Product Snippets. Inaccurate or poor structured data results in simpler snippets like the one in the screenshot below \u2014 or it may not get a spot on the SERP at all.How to add state-of-the-art structured linked data to your e-commerceWordLift adds to your products state-of-the-art structured data and extended product markup that allows you to get more visibility on Google\u2019s retail listing.&nbsp;Furthermore, WordLift allows you to create a Product Knowledge Graph out of the relevant connections between products, brands, product categories and features.&nbsp;This e-commerce specific form of knowledge graph is a powerful tool to enhance the findability of your products. On one side, it helps you get better results in terms of organic search traffic and, on the other, it helps you improve the internal linking structure and refine your product recommendations.&nbsp;If you want to learn more about this and discuss your e-commerce SEO with one of our experts, just book a call.Grow your organic traffic and give a boost to your conversionsTalk with one of our SEO experts!If you want to learn more about this topic, don't miss Doreid Haddad's webinar: how structured data impacts e-commerce sales.

Transactional, informational, and mixed search intentsSure, when a user searches for a specific product, this search is most likely going to result in a conversion. That's why the so-called transactional queries worth so much to Google and to its advertisers \u2014 and most of the time they are also very competitive in terms of CPC. But transactional queries are not the only way to get a sale done. Informational searches can also play a role into the customer journey \u2014 and here is where content marketing makes the most sense: in fact, when you help potential customers to better understand a matter connected with your products and you can trigger them to buy your products. Mixed search intents are often overlooked, but they can play a key role for your sales. What are mixed search intents and how to target themSearch intent is not always binary. Many SERPs try to give an answer to mixed search intents.In these cases, Google populates the SERP with both informational and transactional result, allowing customers to disambiguate their need by making a choice. Let's say that you have an eyewear e-commerce. Of course, in terms of SEO you are targeting eyeglasses brands and specific products that you are selling. But, there is more potential in users' searches. For example, a potential customer who wants to buy new sunglasses may not look for a specific brand or model, and instead try to figure out what are the latest trends before making a purchase. The query would look something like this: sunglasses 2020. Here is what Google gives to these kind of users, whose real intent is ambiguous. As you can see the search engine result page (SERP) contains a Sponsored Product Carousel on the top, while most of the blue links are informative pieces of content related with sunglasses trends for this year. What does it mean? As an e-commerce owner, you can target these mixed search intents to attract potential customers on your website both by entering into Google's Product listings (paid, in this specific case), and by creating a page which puts together informative content and a showcase of your products related with the search. How to gently push your readers to shift from informational to product pagesFor sure, Content marketing is a powerful way to attract potential customers that are just looking for information, exploring a topic, and maybe planning to buy. How do you trigger your readers to buy a product?&nbsp;To shift from informational to transactional intents, you need to gently push your readers to become customers.&nbsp;WordLift puts in the hands of any e-commerce owner the tools to help potential customers take the leap and buy something.1. Product NavigatorE-commerce SEO by WordLift's Product Navigator gives a concrete shape to your readers\u2019 desires by suggesting a series of products that they might be interested in.&nbsp;The Product Navigator of E-commerce SEO by WordLift on Oakley.com USA2.

Product Context CardWhen you mention a specific product on a page, Context Cards allow your readers to have a sneak peek on that product by looking at a very nice preview.&nbsp;&nbsp;How Product Context Cards look like in the context of an editorial piece of contentWrap-up: the pillars of e-commerce SEO strategy in 2022Structured Data is the keyNowadays, adding structured data to your e-commerce product is not only the easiest way to enter into Google Free Product Listings, but it's also the best one, as it allows you to dive deep into the product features. In this way, the users will get an outstanding first glance of your product on the SERP and be enticed to click. If you use WordLift, you can add state-of-the-art structured linked data to your e-commerce without writing a single line of code. The AI will take care of that. Mixed search intents are the low hanging fruit in search marketing for e-commerce websitesSearches are not black or white. The fact that Google can't disambiguate the intent behind generic searches is an opportunity in terms of content marketing. Creating content that targets mixed intent queries could untapp many sales.Always Be ClosingPushing your content readers and potential customers to click on one of your products and buy it requires an intelligent mix of content and UX. Showcasing your products on informational pages or giving your customer's several alternatives and product pairings create a number of chances for the users to see, desire, buy what you're selling.

In a way, Seneca\u2019s legacy provides a way to \u201cphilosophically structure our own lives\u201d (see Massimo Pigliucci\u2019s introduction and commentary to Seneca\u2019s On the happy Life).Seneca\u2019s writings teach us to look at life, ourselves and the human nature in a more calm way with an understanding that reaches beyond the external circumstances and into the very essence of our own being (and doing).Seneca\u2019s written word remains a wonderful place to run away from the noise of the crowd (see Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 7 - On Crowds) where it is upon us to realize the brevity of life (see. Seneca, De Brevitate Vitae) and be very careful with the only thing that is ours and that we so often loose entrapped with pointless digital activities - time (ref. Seneca's advice to collect and keep time: \u201ccollige et serva\u201d from\u00a0Moral letters to Lucilius/Letter 1 - On Saving Time).Seneca\u2019s Life: A Rise, an Exile, a SuicideSeneca was born in Cordoba, capital of the Roman province of Baetica and today\u2019s city of Spain, in the affluent family of Seneca the Elder, Roman rhetorician and writer, and Helvetia, a well-educated woman of a prominent Baetican family.In his early age, Seneca moved to Rome with his father to study rhetoric. After a period of youthful convalescence in Egypt, where his aunt\u2019s husband was a prefect, at the age of 31, Seneca returned to Rome to begin a career in politics and law.During the reign of emperor Caligula (37-40) Seneca was a member of the Senate and established himself as a writer and orator, renowned for his eloquence.In the year 41, Seneca was sentenced in exile in Corsica by emperor Claudius for an alleged adultery. After spending 8 years in exile Seneca was recalled to Rome by Agrippina, the new wife of emperor Claudius and the mother of Nero, the soon-to-be emperor. Becoming a praetor and further the tutor of the future emperor Seneca\u2019s career entered a 10-year rise.In the final years of his life, Seneca withdrew from public life and Roman politics to the countryside where he composed a considerable part of his works.In 65 AD, when Seneca was about 60 years old, under suspicion of conspiring against the emperor, the philosopher was ordered to commit suicide. And so he did.Seneca\u2019s Works: An Immense, Wide-Ranging Literary and Philosophical LegacyThe works of Seneca the Younger comprise a large body of writings with various styles and of diverse form. Most of them cannot be dated with precision and many are known only as titles. The surviving works by Seneca, date between 41 and 65 and include poetry (tragedies and epigrams), prose (philosophical treatises and letters) and a Menippean Satire.Seneca wrote a total of 9 tragedies which are the only fully preserved works of this genre in Rome: \tMedea \tOedipus \tAgamemnon \tThyestes \tTroades (The Trojan Women) \tPhoenissae (The Phoenician Women) \tPhaedra \tHercules Furens (The Madness of Hercules) \tHercules Oetaeus (Hercules on Oeta)In his tragedies, Seneca uses stories and characters from the dramas of Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides, strengthening the pathos they originally carry and amplifying the ugliness of the immoral, conceived as an opposition of virtue - the higher good according to the Stoic principles.The ideas of Stoicism - the ancient Greek school of philosophy founded by Zeno, Seneca develops in his Dialogues. Collectively known as Dialogi, Seneca\u2019s Dialogues are 10 treatises in 12 books, as found in an eleventh-century Ambrosian manuscript. Among the most prominent of them are: \tDe Vita Beata (On the happy life) \tAd Marciam, De consolatione (To Marcia, On consolation) \tAd Helviam matrem, De consolatione (To Helvia, On consolation) \tDe Brevitate Vitae (On the shortness of life) \tDe Providentia (On providence) \tDe ira (On anger) \tDe Tranquillitate Animi (On tranquillity of mind) \tDe Constantia Sapientis (On the Firmness of the Wise Person)Among Seneca\u2019s other works are Apocolocyntosis divi Claudii (Pumpkinification of the Divine Claudius) - a witty political skit, and Naturales quaestiones (Natural Questions) where Seneca writes about the problems of the nature of things, which inevitably are associated with ethics.Ethics, virtue and good life are discussed in Seneca\u2019s Ad Lucilium epistulae morales (Moral Letters to Lucilius). The 124 essays are concise treatises in the form of diatribe in which specific occasions of everyday life evoke philosophical generalizations, treating a wide range of moral challenges.The Seneca RenaissanceSeneca\u2019s philosophical views, considered among the most read in Stoics teachings, and his way of seeing the virtuous life have resonated loudly for many authors and readers from Antiquity till today. How \u201cSeneca\u2019s intellectual power is currently radiating far beyond the realm of specialized philosophy \u201d is very well described in Brill's Companion to Seneca: Philosopher and Dramatist.With Seneca\u2019s maxims for ethical understandings and behaviour he has been an inspiration for more than 2 millennia. True to the tradition of Stoicism, in his philosophical treatises Seneca places an emphasis on virtue, austerity and self-possession. And it seems that this never-ending desire to understand the self and master it that makes Seneca\u2019s writings timeless.",

        "text": "Implementing Structured Data for SEO with Bill Slawski https://wordlift.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/structured-data-seo.mp3We had the opportunity to interview Bill Slawski, Director of SEO Research at Go Fish Digital, Creator and Author of SEO by the Sea. Bill Slawski is among the most authoritative people in the SEO community, a hybrid between an academic researcher and a practitioner. He has been looking at how search engines work since 1996. With Andrea Volpini we took the chance to ask Bill a few questions to understand how SEO is evolving and why you should understand the current picture, to keep implementing a successful SEO strategy! When did you start with SEO?Bill Slawski: I started doing SEO in 1996. I also made my first site in 1996. The brother of one of the people I worked on that site, she was selling computers for a digital equipment corp at that time., she sent us an email saying, \"Hey, we just started this new website. You guys might like it.\" It was the time in which AltaVista was a primary search engine. This was my first chance to see a search engine in action. My client said, \"We need to be in this.\" I tried to figure out how, and that was my first attempt at doing SEO!After the launch of Google Discover, it seems that we live in a query-less world? How has SEO changed? Bill Slawski: It has changed, but it hasn't changed that much. I remember in 2007 giving a presentation in an SEO meetup on named entities. Things have been in the atmosphere. We just haven't really brought them to the forefront and talked about them too much. Query-less searches example? You're driving down the road 50 miles an hour, you wave your phone around in the air and it's a signal to your phone asking you where you're going. \"Give me navigation, what's ahead of us? What's the traffic like? Are there detours?\" And your phone can tell you that. It can say there's a five-minute delay up ahead. You really don't need a query for that.What do you then, If you don't need a query?Bill Slawski: Well, for the Google Now, for it to show you search suggestions, it needs to have some idea of what your search history is like, what you're interested in. In Google Now, you can feed it information about your interests, but it can also look at what you've searched for in the past, what you look like you have an interest in. If you want to see certain information about a certain sports team or a movie or a TV series, you search for those things and it knows you have an interest in them.Andrea Volpini: It's a context that gets built around the user. In one analysis that we run from one of our VIP customers, by looking at the data from the Google search console I found extremely interesting how it had reached 42%! You can see actually this big bump is due to the fact that Google started to account this data. This fact might be scaring a lot of people in the SEO industry. As, if we live in a query-less world, how do you optimize for it? Can we do SEO in a query-less world?Bill Slawski: They (SEO practitioners) should be happy about it. They should be excited about it.Andrea Volpini: I was super excited. When I saw it, for me, it was like a revelation, because I have always put a lot of effort into creating data and metadata. Before we arrived to structure data, it's always been a very important aspect of the website that we build. I used to build CMS, so I was really into creating data. But I underestimated the impact of a content recommendation through Google Discover when it comes to the traffic of a new website. Did you expect something like this?Bill Slawski: If you watch how Google is tracking trends, entity search, and you can identify which things are entities by them having an entity type associated with them, something other than just search term, so you search for a baseball team or a football team and you see search term is one category associated with it, and the other category might be professional Chicago baseball team. The professional Chicago baseball team is the entity. Google's tracking entities. What this means is when they identify interests that you may have, they may do that somewhat broadly, and they may show you as a searcher in Google Now in Discover things related to that. If you write about some things with some level of generalization that might fit some of the broader categories that match a lot, you're gonna show up in some of those discovery things.It's like when Google used to show headers in search results, \"Search news now,\" or \"Top news now,\" and identify your site or something you wrote as a blog post as something fits top news now category, you didn't apply to have that. You were a beneficiary of Google's recommendation.Andrea Volpini: Yes. When I saw this, I started to look a little bit at the data in the Google search console of this client and then another client and then another client again. What I found out by comparing these first sites is that Google is tending not to make an overlap with Google search and Discover, meaning that if it's bringing traffic on Google search, the page might not be featured on Discover. The pages that are featured on Discover that are also on Google search as high ranking. But I found extremely interesting the fact that pages that didn't receive any organic traffic had been discovered by Google Discover as if Google is trying to differentiate these channels.Is this two-level search effect widening? Bill Slawski: I think they're trying to broaden, we might say, broaden our experience. Give us things that we're not necessarily searching for, but are related. There's at least one AI program I've worked with where it looks at my Twitter stream and recommends storage for me based upon where I've been tweeting. I see Google taking a role like that: \"These are some other things they might be interested in that they haven't been searching for. Let me show them to them.\" There's a brilliant Google contributor video about the Semantic Search Engine. The first few minutes, he starts off saying, \"Okay, I had trouble deciding what to name this video. I thought about The Discover Search Engine. Then I thought about A Decision Search Engine and realized Bing had already taken that. A Smart Search Engine. Well, that's obvious.\"But capturing what we're interested in is something Google's seeming to try to do more of with the related questions that people also ask. We're seeing Google trying to keep us on search results pages, clicking through, question after question, seeing things that are related that we're interested in. Probably tracking every click that we make as to what we might have some interest in. With one box results, the same type of thing. They'll keep on showing us one box results if we keep on clicking on them. If we stop clicking on them, they'll change those.Andrea Volpini: Where are we going with all of these? How do you see the role of SEO is changing? What would you recommend to an SEO that starts today, what should he become? You told us how you started in '96 with someone asking you to be on AltaVista, and I remember AltaVista quite well. I also worked with AltaVista myself, and we started to use AltaVista for intranet. What would you recommend to someone that starts SEO today?Bill Slawski: I'm gonna go back to 2005 to a project I worked on then. It was for Baltimore.org. It was a visitor's center of Baltimore, the conference center. They wanted people to visit the city and see it and see everything they had to offer. They were trying to rank well for terms like Baltimore bars and Baltimore sports. They got in their heads that they wanted to rank well for Baltimore black history. We tried to optimize a page for Baltimore black history. We put the words \"Baltimore Black History\" on the page a few times. There were too many other good sites which were talking about Baltimore's black history. We were failing miserably to rank well for that phrase. I turned to a copywriter and I said, \"There are great places in Baltimore to see they have something to do with this history. Let's write about those. Let's create a walking tour of the city. Let's show people the famous black churches and black colleges and the nine-foot-tall statue of Billie Holiday, the six townhomes that Frederick Douglas bought in his 60s.\"He was an escaped slave at one point in time, came back to Baltimore as he got older and a lot richer and started buying properties and became a businessman. Let's show people those places. Let's tell them how to get there.\" We created a page that was walking tour of Baltimore. After three months, it was the sixth most visited page on that site, a site of about 300 pages or so. That was really good. That was successful. It got people to actually visit the city of Baltimore. They wanted to see those things.Aaron Bradley ran this series of tweets the other day where one of the things he said was, \"Don't get worried about the switch in search engines to entities. Entities are all around us. They surround us. They're everywhere. They're everything you can write about. They're web pages. They're people. They're places.\" It's true. If we switch from a search based on words, on matching words, on documents to words and queries, we're missing the opportunity to write about things, to identify attributes, properties associated with those things to tell people about what's in the world around us, and they're gonna search for those things. That's a movement that search engine makes you, being able to understand what you're talking about something in particular and return information about that thing.Andrea Volpini: The new SEO should become basically a contextual writer, someone that intercepts the intents and can create good content around it. Is there something else in the profession of SEO in 2020?Bill Slawski: One of the things I read about recently was something called entity extraction. Search engine being able to read a page, identify all the things that are on that page that are being written about, and all the contexts that surround those things, all the classes, all the ... you see the example on the post I wrote about was a baseball player, Bryce Harper. Bryce Harper was a Washington National. Bryce Harper hits home runs. That's the context. He's hit so many home runs over his career. Having search engine being able to take facts on a page, understand them, and make a collection of those facts, compare them to what's said on other pages about the same entities, so they can fact check. It can do the fact check-in itself. It doesn't need some news organizations to do that.Andrea Volpini: Well, this is the reason when we started our project, my initial idea was to create a semantic editor to let people create link data. I didn't look at SEO as a potential market, but then I realized that immediately, all the interest was coming from, indeed, the SEO community. For instance, we created your entity on the WordLift website. This means that when we annotate the content with our tool, we have this permanent linked data ID. In the beginning, I thought it was natural to have permanent linked data IDs, because this was the way that the semantic web worked. But then I suddenly realized there is a very strong SEO effect in doing that because Google is also crawling this RDF that I'm publishing.I saw a few months back that it's actually a different class of IP that Google uses for crawling this data. Do you think that it still makes sense to publish your own linked data ID, or it's okay to use other IDs? Do you see value in publishing data with your own systems?Bill Slawski: Something I haven't really thought about too much. But it's worth considering. I've seen people publishing those. I've tried to put one of those together, and I asked myself, \"Why am I doing this? Is there gonna be value to it? Is it gonna be worthwhile?\" But when I put together my homepage, a page about me, I wanted to try it, see what it was capable of, to see what it might show in search engines for doing that. Some of it showed some of it didn't. It was interesting to experiment with and try and see what the rest of the world is catching onto when you do create that stuff.Andrea Volpini: But this is actually how the entity of Gennaro Cuofano was born in the Knowledge Graph. We started to add a lot of reference in telling Google, \"Here is Gennaro, is also authors of these books.\" As soon as we injected this information into our Knowledge Graph and into the pages, for Google it was easier to collect the data and fact-check and say, \"Okay, this is the guy that wrote the book and now works for this company,\" and so on and so forth.Gennaro Cuofano: and Google provided a Knowledge Panel with a complete description. It was something that before, it was not showing up in search, or at least it was just partial information. It felt like, by providing this kind of information, we allowed the search engine, actually Google, to have a better context and fact-check the information which gave it authority to the information that I provided.Bill Slawski: Have you looked at Microsoft's Concept Graph?Andrea Volpini: Yes! It's even more advanced. I found it more advanced in away. It's also very quick in getting the information in. We have a lot more easy experience when we are someone that wants to be in Bing because as soon as we put such data it gets it into the panel.Bill Slawski: It surprised me because, for a while, stuff that Microsoft Research in Asia was doing was disappearing. They put together probates and it stopped. Nothing happened for a couple of years. It's been revived into the Microsoft Concept Graph, which is good to see. It's good to see they did something with all that work.Gennaro Cuofano: Plus, we don't know how much integration is also Bink and LinkedIn APIs Andrea Volpini: It's pretty strong! Probably the quickest entry in the Satori, the Knowledge Graph of Microsoft, is now for a person to be on LinkedIn, because it is like they're using this information.What other ways can we use the structure data currently for SEO? Bill Slawski: One of the things I would say to that is augmentation queries. I mentioned those in the presentation. Google will not only look at queries associated with pages about a particular person, place or thing, but it will also query the log information and will look at structured data associated with the page, and it will run queries based upon those. It's doing some machine learning to try to understand what else might be interesting about pages of yours. If these augmentation queries, the test queries that it runs about your page, tend to do as well as the original queries for your page in terms of people selecting things, people clicking on things. It might combine the augmentation query results with the original query results when it shows people them for your page.New schemas from the latest version of Schema 3.5 is the \u201cknows about\u201d attribute. I mentioned with the knows about attribute, you could be a plumber, you could know about drain repair. Some searches will send you plumbers, and they expect to see information just about Los Angeles plumbers, they may see a result from a Los Angeles plumber that talks about drain repair. That may be exactly what they're looking for. That may expand search results, expand something relevant to your site that you've identified as an area of expertise, which I think is interesting. I like that structured data is capable of a result like that.What is your favorite new addition to Schema 3.5?Bill Slawski: FAQ page!On Schema.org there's such a wide range. They're gonna update that every month now. But just having things like bed type is good.What do you think is the right balance when I add structured data to my pages between an over-complicated data structuring and simplicity?Bill Slawski: I Did SEO for a site a few years ago that was an apartment complex. It was having trouble renting units. There was a four-page apartment complex, and it showed up its dog park really well. It didn't show off things like the fact that if you took the elevator to the basement, you got let out to the DC metro where you could travel all throughout Washington DC, northern Virginia, and southern Maryland and visit all 31 Smithsonian, and a lot of other things that are underground, underneath that part of Virginia. It was right next to what's called Pentagon City, which is the largest shopping mall in Virginia. It's four stories tall, all underground. You can't see it from the street. Adding structured data to your page to identify those is something you can do. It's probably something you should include on the page itself.Maybe you want to include information, more information, on your pages about entities and include them in structured data, too, in a way that is really precise. You're using that language identified and Schema that subject matter experts describe as something people might want to know. It defines it well. It defines it easily.What you're saying is do what you do with your content with your data. If you put emphasis on an aspect content-wise, then you should also do the proper markup for it?Bill Slawski: Right! With the apartment complex I was talking about, location sells. It gets people to decide, \"This is where I want to live.\" Tell them about the area around them. Put that on your page and put that in your data. Don't show pictures of the dog park if you want to tell them what the area schools are like and what the community's like, what business is around, what opportunities there are. You can go to the basement, this apartment complex, and ride to the local baseball stadium or the local football stadium. You're blocks away. DC traffic is a nightmare. If you ride the metro line everywhere, you're much better off...Andrea Volpini: That's big. Also metro in real estate, we say it, it's always increased 30% the value of the real estate if you have a metro station close by. Definitely is relevant. Something that is relevant for the business should be put into consideration also when structuring the page.Is it worth also exploring Schema which is not yet officially used by Google? Bill Slawski: You can anticipate things that never happen. That's possible. But sometimes, maybe anticipating things correctly can be a competitive advantage if it comes into fruition that it's come about. You mentioned real estate. Have you seen things like walkability scores being used on realty sites? The idea that somebody can give you a metric to tell you where you can compare easily one location to another based on what you can do without a car, it's a nice feature. Being able to find out data about a location could be really useful.Andrea Volpini: This is why, getting back to the linked data ID, this is why having a linked data ID for the articles and the entities that describe the article become relevant because then you can query the data yourself, and then you can make an analysis of what neighborhood that the least amount of traffic, and see, \"Okay, did I write about this neighborhood or not?\" This is also one of the experiments that we do these days is that we bring the entity data from the page into Google Analytics to help the editorial team think about what traffic entities are generating across multiple pages. Entities in a way can also be used internally for organizing things and for saying, \"Yes, in this neighborhood, for instance, we have the least amount of criminality\" or things like that. You can start cross-checking data, not only waiting for Google to use the data. You can also use the data yourself.Is there any other aspect worth mentioning about how to use structured data for SEO? Bill Slawski: Mike Blumenthal wrote an article based upon something I wrote about, the thing about entity extraction. He said, \"Hotels are entities, and if you put information about hotels, about bookings, about locations, about amenities onto your pages so that people can find them, so people can identify those things, you're making their experience searching for things richer and more ...\"Andrea Volpini: We had a case where we had done especially this for lodging business. We have seen that as soon as we have started to add amenities as structured data, and most importantly, as soon as we had started to actually add geographic references to the places that this location we're in, we saw an increase, not in pure traffic terms. The traffic went up. But we also saw an interesting phenomenon of queries becoming broader. The site, before having structured data to the hotels and to the lodging business, received traffic from very few keywords. As soon as we started to add the structured data and typing amenities and services, we also added the Schema action for booking, we saw that Google was bringing a lot more traffic on long tail keywords for a lot of different location that this business had hotels in, but it was not being visible on Google.Bill Slawski: It wasn't just matching names of locations on your pages to names of locations and queries, it was Google understanding where you were located-What do you think Schema Actions are useful for?Bill Slawski: There was a patent that came out a couple of years ago where Google said, \"You can circle an entity on a mobile device and you can register actions associated with those entities.\" Somebody got the idea right and the concept wrong. They were thinking about touchscreens instead of voice. They never really rewrote that so that it was voice activated, so you could register actions with spoken queries instead of these touch queries. But I like the idea. Alexa has the programs, being able to register actions with your entities is not too different from what existed in Google before. Think about how you would optimize a local search page where you would make sure your address was in a postal format so that it was more likely to be found and used. Of course, you wanted people to drive to a location, you'd want to give them driving directions, and that's something you can register in action for now, but it's already in there. It feels like you're helping Google implement things that it should be implementing anyway, or you're likely to be.Andrea Volpini: Of course. I think that's a very beautiful point, that we're doing something that we should do. We're now doing it for Google, but that's the way it should be done. I like it. I like it a lot.How much do you think structured data's gonna help for voice search?Bill Slawski: I can see Schema not being necessary because of other things going on, like the entity extraction, where Google is trying to identify. But Google tends to do things in a redundant way. They tend to have two different channels to get the same thing done. If one gets something correct and the other doesn't, it fails to, they still have it covered. I think Schema gives them that chance. It gives site owners a chance to include things that maybe Google might have missed. If Google captures stuff and they have an organization like Schema behind them, which isn't the search engine, it's a bunch of volunteers who are subject matter experts in a lot of places or play those on TV, some are really good at that. Some of them miss some things. If you are a member of the Schema community mailing list, the conversations that take place where people call people on things, like, \"Wouldn't you do this for this? Wouldn't you do that? Why aren't you doing this?\" It's interesting to read those conversations.Andrea Volpini: Absolutely. I always enjoy the mailing list of Schema, because as you said, you have a different perspective and different subject matter expert that of course are in the need of declaring what their content is about. Yeah, I think that Schema, I see it as a site map for data. Even though Google can crawl the information, it always values the fact that there is someone behind that it's curating the data and that might add something that they might have missed, as you say, but also give them a chance to come to check and say, \"Okay, this is true or not?\"Bill Slawski: You want a scalable web. It does make sense to have editors curating what gets listed. That potentially is an issue with Wikipedia at some point in the future. There's only so much human edited knowledge it's gonna handle. When some event changes the world overnight and some facts about some important things change, you don't want human editors trying to catch up as quickly as they can to get it correct. You want some automated way of having that information updated. Will we see that? We have organizations like DeepMind mining sites like the DailyMail and CNN. They chose those not necessarily because they're the best sources of news, but because they're structured in a way that makes it easy to find that.What SEOs should be looking at as of now? What do they need be very careful about? Bill Slawski: It would be not to be intimidated by the search engine grabbing content from web pages and publishing it in knowledge panels. Look for the opportunities when they're there. Google is business, and as a business, they base what they do on advertising. But they're not trying to steal your business. They may take advantage of business models that maybe need to be a little more sophisticated than \u201chow tall is Abraham Lincoln? \u201cYou could probably build something a little bit more robust than that as a business model. But if Google's stealing your business model from you in what they publish on knowledge panels, you should work around its business model and not be intimidated by it. Consider how much of an opportunity it is potentially to have a channel where you're being focused upon, located easily, by people who might value your services.",

        "text": "The Fool The Fool (Le Mat or Il Matto, respectively in French and Italian decks) is one of the 78 cards in a Tarot deck and one of the 22 Trump cards that make up the Major Arcana. The Fool is technically unnumbered so it is represented by the number 0 or by the number twenty-two, making it the first or the last card in&nbsp;Major Arcana decksThe Fool is considered a powerful card: it stands for a new beginning as well as a mean to an end of something old (therefore its position at the beginning or at the end of the deck), it represents changing and risk.Tarots can be read in a positive or negative position entitling different meaning to it; when reading it in a positive position it stands for promising new horizons and challenges and unexpected but surprising experiences, all things illogical but winning. In the negative position reading it means the letting of one's self to the nothingness, depression and insecurity... an escape from reality.The card, like all Tarots, is composed of several elements: firstly, The Fool is seen wearing a colourful dress with a jester's hat and carries a knapsack over his back, full of his belongings. He is sided (or chased away) by an animal, often a dog or a cat, which torns his pants. All the elements may vary in interpretation and depiction depending on the origin of the Tarot deck.",

        "text": "Intertextuality Intertextuality is a word coined in late 1960s by philosopher Julia Kristeva to describe the phenomenon of a continual exchange and relationship building between texts.The term intertextuality was born within the paradigm of poststructuralism - a school of thought in which Kristeva is often included, along with Derrida, Foucault, Baudrillard. Originally intertextuality served as a literary device for clarifying the process of interpreting any text by seeing the combination of multiple other texts that underlie it. Later, the term acquired a much wider scope of meanings to embody a myriad of textual and other interrelations.To understand a text through the prism of intertextuality is to perceive it as a tapestry of many other texts, ideas and contexts, woven together. Intertextuality invites us to read and interpret texts through their multiple references to other texts.No Text is a Hermetic Totality, Nor Intertextuality IsIntertextuality is best understood when looked at as a process of texts talking both to the reader and to each other thus forging the emergence of a sandbox for meaning where: \ttexts play \tvarious signifying systems merge \ttexts meet, influence, collide with and enrich each other.In other words, no text is an island, nor it is a hermetic totality. Powered by multiple references to other ideas, works, interpretations and contexts, every text steps on the shoulders of other texts, connecting implicitly or explicitly to their associations and understandings.Intertextuality itself is an intertextual beingOn one hand, Kristeva\u2019s term is intertextual in its essence; it merges her perception of Ferdinand de Saussure\u2019s semiotics (the study of how signs derive their meaning within the structure of a text) and Bakhtin\u2019s dialogism (the examination of the multiple meanings in each text and in each word (for more see the wonderful work:&nbsp;Interrogating Julia Kristeva's Concept of Intertextuality)A text, as explained by Kristeva in her work Desire in Language: A Semiotic Approach to Literature and Art, is:a permutation of texts, intertextuality in the given text,\u201d where \u201cseveral utterances, taken from other texts intersect and neutralize one anotherJulia&nbsp;Kristeva, Desire in Language: A Semiotic Approach to Literature and ArtOn the other hand, intertextuality\u2019s further existence implies a variety of intertextual relationships: with time the term accrues more meanings and understandings from various domains and disciplines to serve diverse purposes: from understanding texts, to deconstructing socio-cultural phenomena.Text is not a unilinear entity but a heterogeneous combination of texts. Any text is at once literary and social, creative and cultural. They are culturally and institutionally fashioned.Interrogating Julia Kristeva's Concept of IntertextualityFollow the White Rabbit: An Example of IntertextualityThere are numerous and diverse types of intertextual relationships and as many ways of finding such in any author piece. The most easy to spot examples of intertextuality are the references between and inside literature works. Next come movie allusions, or songs, collages. Creativity and its manifestations are literally all connected and in an endless loop of citation, echoing each other.Intertextuality is effortlessly remembered as texts echoing other texts.One of the many examples for such meaning amplification (or echoing), is the movie Matrix.Take the sentence \u201cFollow the White Rabbit\u201d, for example.When this rings in the reader\u2019s mind it not only relies on itself as a sentence but also steps on a broader plane of meanings: associations and previous knowledge accrued by the interpreter of this same line through their previous encounters with the sentence and the relationships it has entered before, the most obvious one being \u201cFollow the white rabbit\u201d for Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland.It in this way that the reference becomes weighty, saying more than one thing and serving as a springboard for the reader\u2019s mind to explore broader and deeper associations.Intertextuality in the Context of the World Wide WebWeb resources are in constant exchange of references, most of which made explicit with the help of the all-mighty hypertext. This provides ground for connections on many levels, thus expanding the ways we interpret and write texts.The way intertextuality helps us in the context of the World Wide Web is by providing a way to deconstruct reader\u2019s needs through their texts (social media, email interactions, blog comments, reviews, shares, interest graphs, questions etc) and on the basis of this to create richer, more relevant texts, broader content structures - with enough touching points and most importantly granular connections that allow interactions on multiple levels.Applying the understanding of intertextuality to the way we craft texts for the Web takes thinking about the links in these text on a whole new level and allows for finding just the right references to ideas, contexts and things to genuinely connect with the reader and add more meaning to their understanding of the subject in question. In practice, electronic, explicitly, traceable linked intertextuality means that one day we will say: hey, robo ? give me references to \u201cfollow the white rabbit\u201d. And isn\u2019t that a glamorous textual play and a magnificent opportunity for building relationships and meaning in cyberspace?",

        "text": "Build Your first Bot powered by WordPress Few weeks ago I did a very basic experiment to create, for one of our test websites, a bot on Telegram and to feed it with data coming from their WordPress website.Camminando Con is a trekking organization,&nbsp;offering&nbsp;hiking tours in a small valley one hour from Rome and the content structure of their website reflects their simple business model. They use WordLift to structure this content in a way that allows them to exploit it in several ways.&nbsp;WordLift helps digital editors organizing and structuring the content of a website. WordLift creates open datasets of all the things that matter and publishes them as open data.Presenting&nbsp;their excursions -&nbsp;structured by WordLift&nbsp;as events using the schema.org vocabulary - they describe all the sites&nbsp;they visit on their tours - represented as places in schema.org&nbsp;-&nbsp;so that anyone, by reading their site, can get a good understanding of the upcoming events and the territory they will explore.This structured data is then connected&nbsp;through WordLift's interactive map and discovery&nbsp;widgets that allow&nbsp;their users to explore related content.Once the content work is done, they promote it via&nbsp;their website and an active Facebook page. I thought I could add a new interaction channel to their communication plan, leveraging the knowledge graph they create&nbsp;event after event.&nbsp;Let's build the BotTelegram is a messaging platform similar to WhatsApp, WeChat or Facebook Messenger that lets users communicate in groups or one-to-one. I\u2019ve chosen Telegram because&nbsp;chat-bots can be easily created: you simply chat with another Bot called the \u2018BothFather\u2019 (just look for it and add it to your contact list) and your automata will be ready to go in a second. Here are the steps you need to follow: BotFather supports several commands; to create a new Bot open a chat with him and send the /newbot command.Take note of the API key (token) and remember&nbsp;that a bot always uses a user name ending in bot (i.e. WordLiftBot).Now&nbsp;create a new public (or private)&nbsp;channel and add the bot as administrator of the channel (the bot does\u2019t appear in the list of friend so you will need to remember its name and type it - WordLiftBot in our case).Your&nbsp;Bot is now the admin of the chat channel. Not bad in just few minutes, right? What\u2019s next? Next we need to get an update every time a new event is published on the CamminandoCon website. In the CamminandoCon website, as seen earlier, events are constantly updated to promote the upcoming hiking tours and every event focuses on 3 or 4 locations at the time (villages or point of interests that will be seen while walking).To recall their events&nbsp;we are going to use an HTTP end-point that WordLift adds to every website:&nbsp;http://&lt;yourwebsite&gt;/wl_entity_type/event; through this end-point we can get an ordered list of all the events published on the site; adding&nbsp;/feed/ to this URL (http://&lt;yourwebsite&gt;/wl_entity_type/event/feed)&nbsp;the list is automatically converted by WordPress into an RSS feed that we can use with our Bot.&nbsp;To glue our Telegram Bot with the RSS feed coming from WordLift - without writing a single line of code - I used IFTTT. Get a login there (if you don't have one already) and create a new recipe IF &gt; Feed adding the RSS feed generated by WordLift.The THEN part is a Maker (a simple app that lets you send web requests to publicly available APIs) and here is how to configure it:Last, you have to use the API key received by the Bot Father and add it before the /sendMessage as shown above (https://api.telegram.org/&lt;your-api-key&gt;/sendMessage). The method is set to POST and the Content Type is application/x-www-form-urlencoded. The Body contains the actual message that the Bot shall send. Here we can see we\u2019re asking to send the update in the @CamminandoCon channel and the text is a combination of elements derived from the RSS feed such as the Title, the URL and the Image.Here is the result as seen on the Telegram desktop client.Happy Bot development!",

        "text": "Why Affiliate Marketing Needs Content More Than Ever Affiliate marketing continues to boom as an industry. Made possible by the rapid advance of digital technology, the simple practice of distributing customized links has become a reliable source of income for those capable of reaching relevant audiences \u2014 people deemed \u2018influencers\u2019 with opinions on products and services likely to be mirrored by their followers.But ever since Twitter first got mainstream attention, we\u2019ve seen a move away from in-depth reviews and roundups and towards brief and formulaic social media posts. Aspiring celebrities litter their accounts with #ad posts offering nothing more than generic endorsements with mandated hold-the-product-and-smile photos.With all the clutter, an impartial observer might well conclude that there\u2019s way too much affiliate marketing \u2018content\u2019 already. They\u2019d be wrong, though. In fact, the affiliate marketing industry needs content more than ever. Why? Let\u2019s get into it.The demand for content isn\u2019t going downThe digital content landscape is much like an insatiable deep-sea behemoth \u2014 no matter how much it consumes on any given day, it\u2019s always in need of fresh, varied material shortly after. And though bland influencer posts get a lot of attention (and presumably do get results), they\u2019re like bite-sized snacks, light and inconsequential. No one browses the glossy photos of a celebrity Instagram account and burns out on high-quality content.Indeed, the average internet user is going to consume a broad range of content types. They might browse social media channels on their phone while commuting, read long-form articles throughout their working days, then watch YouTube videos after getting home (with newer generations favoring video). Each type of content they consume provides a fresh affiliate marketing opportunity, and consuming too much of one type isn\u2019t going to sour them on others.And new technology is going to keep bringing new content types. We\u2019ve already seen the world of podcasting become absolutely enormous (largely supported by affiliate marketing, notably), and it\u2019s possible that VR content will be next. Since any kind of content can be supported through affiliate links, there\u2019s a lot of space waiting to be filled.People respect transparent sponsorshipsConsider the ongoing struggles of digital advertising models. Tired of ads that affect their online experience and emboldened by access to ad-blocking tools, internet users have quickly lost their willingness to put up with invasive advertising methods. Even as programmatic technology squeezes ever-higher levels of efficiency from PPC, the industry suffers at the hands of user reluctance and marketing saturation.Affiliate marketing, though, can be done seamlessly without detracting from the content or engaging in any rhetorical shenanigans. And it doesn\u2019t even require any pretense. It\u2019s entirely possible to have a strong and productive seller/marketer arrangement without hiding anything from the prospective buyers \u2014 in fact, being entirely brazen can be very effective because people like being approached with honesty.When an influencer produces a high-quality video series openly sponsored by a particular brand, it makes both parties look good. The brand earns plaudits for financing good content and the influencer gets to show off improved production values. Provided the content is good enough, followers won\u2019t care about the promotional nature \u2014 and they\u2019ll be more likely to want to pointedly click on an affiliate link to support the brand (as opposed to doing so unknowingly).Social proof is enormously powerfulWith every day that passes, the internet gives us more e-commerce opportunities and more product information. No matter what you\u2019re looking to buy, you\u2019ll be able to find countless models, versions, configurations, and prices, with every business you encounter eager to claim that only their product is worth your time \u2014 ignore all other contenders.Since we can\u2019t reach out to touch items through the digital realm, we are required to judge for ourselves whether any given proposition is really worth our time, and it\u2019s hard to do that when we face so many similar options. That\u2019s why we rely so heavily on social proof. We need people whose opinions we trust to give us some guidance and help us figure out which products are worth our money and which brands are worth our time.While social proof has always been important (we are social animals, of course), it was less so when the internet was newer and people were inclined to give sites the benefit of the doubt.Following numerous high-profile cases of user data being leaked, and a general push towards higher security standards through things like HTTPS, users are on high alert, and not inclined to take unnecessary chances. If you can establish yourself as an expert in your field, people will absolutely listen to what you have to say.Discerning buyers are increasingly thoroughWe\u2019ve established that internet users are a lot more cautious than ever before when it comes to the companies they trust with their data or their money, but this isn\u2019t purely a result of the aforementioned data leaks \u2014 it\u2019s also a generational thing. Younger generations have reached maturity with the internet available to them, and feel perfectly comfortable engaging in large amounts of online research before making big decisions.Someone from an older generation might go into a large store, ask the assistant which camera they should buy, and then go with that option \u2014 someone younger would be far more likely to take an in-depth look at the features and search for a comprehensive breakdown to read. And since tastes vary, they might look at various different pieces of content before finding one coming from their kind of perspective.Combine the average buyer\u2019s desire for thorough analysis with their eagerness to find an influencer operating on their wavelength and you get an affiliate marketing world that always has room for good content from fresh faces.The viable marketing pool keeps growingAffiliate programs are far more common and well-rounded than ever before. The cost-effective nature of the model has been consistently demonstrated, and since detailed analytics make it easy to tell where a page visitor came from, the range of companies supporting affiliate marketing out of the gate continues to expand.Note that the end result of an affiliate marketing arrangement needn\u2019t be someone buying a product \u2014 it could be someone using a service, or downloading a file, or visiting a page. Through call-tracking software and the establishment of sophisticated analytics goals, you can place a monetary value on almost any action, online or offline. And where there\u2019s value, there\u2019s an opportunity for affiliate marketing.To get the ball rolling, try throwing together some niches on a whim. Here are some quick tips: \tStart with terms like \u201cbest\u201d, \u201ctop\u201d and \u201croundup\u201d \u2014 they\u2019re clear markers for affiliate reviews because they immediately get to the point. \tThink of a subject that you can usefully comment on and add a product or service associated with it (e.g. \u201cBest motorbikes\u201d or \u201cTop cycling gloves\u201d). \tTo find a query with less competition, add on some additional terms that you can optimize for. Try terms related to purpose (\u201cBest scarves for jogging\u201d), location (\u201cTop headphones in Chicago, Illinois\u201d) or pricing (\u201cBudget tax software roundup\u201d). \tOnce you find something without too much competition for rankings, start looking into affiliate schemes for those products \u2014 if you can\u2019t find anything, contact the seller\u00a0directly to see if you can arrange something manually.(Note: Be careful that you choose something with a fairly static range. For instance, \u201cBluetooth speakers in New York\u201d should return a product set that will change infrequently, while \u201cHouston businesses for sale\u201d won\u2019t be so useful because they\u2019re one-time deals and could sell while you\u2019re writing the content (content is great for real estate if you\u2019re close to the deals, but not if you\u2019re just doing affiliate work). If you\u2019re going to create high-quality affiliate content, make sure it can continue to deliver value on an ongoing basis.)As you can see, there\u2019s a remarkable amount of uncovered ground in the affiliate marketing world. In fact, there are so many different searches carried out every day that the idea of the affiliate marketing world being totally saturated is ludicrous. You may not be able to grab the low-hanging fruit at this point, but if you diversify your affiliate work, you\u2019ll still reap the benefits.ConclusionWrapping up, the affiliate marketing world needs content more than ever before for the following reasons (and possibly more): \tNo matter how much content is created, people always want more. \tSponsorships are readily accepted today. \tSocial proof is only getting more powerful. In-depth research needs new perspectives. \tMore things can be marketed than ever before.If you\u2019re just getting started in the affiliate marketing world, or you\u2019ll be trying it for a while, don\u2019t get discouraged by the apparent saturation of basic Instagram influencer posts. That isn\u2019t the only kind of viable content \u2014 you can reach your audience elsewhere, and if you make your content good enough, the results will amaze you.[et_pb_section global_module=\"9265\"][/et_pb_section]",

Last Tuesday we arrived in Leipzig for the SEMANTiCS conference sponsored by our EU research project MICO and we completed the development of this website that lets users instantly grab an account to get started with the latest release of our plugin. ?The message at the conference was received loud and clear - the linked data community knows WordLift already after all. Now we will start full steam to bring the plugin outside of the research world and in the hands of journalists, content producers, bloggers, site builders and enterprises.For much of these four past years we've been working to develop a product that would help content creators produce richer content and organize it around their audience. Whilst continuing working on other projects to finance WordLift we have finally created a dedicated team around the plugin and we\u2019re getting on board our first clients.WordLift organizes knowledge, reducing the complexity of content management and digital marketing operations to let authors focus on stories and communities. The plugin brings content discovery and recommendations, adds semantic markup but most importantly, WordLift publishes all metadata as linked open data as a new way to syndicate content and implement new business models.Join us on this journeyIn spirit of listening closely to our early users, we're continuing the development of the plugin on GitHub where anyone can vote, comment or contribute on the features they want to see in WordLift.Please feel free to email us on hello@wordlift.io if you have any feature requests, comments, or just want to say \u201cciao\u201d.We're also available on Twitter @wordliftit and Facebook.",

        "text": "Google Entity Carousels: How to Earn Your Spot Google Carousels for ranked entities appear when you make searches like \u201ctop 10 seo tools\u201d. These are entities presented as cards in Google SERP that can be used to further refine search results.&nbsp;Google Entity Carousel: a list of ranked entities belonging to the same category.In this article I will share a use case and the lessons learned while managing to add back an entity in one of these carousels that had been missing for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a Google carousel?&nbsp;A carousel is a list of entities that users can swipe through to discover entities that belong to the same category. It is highly used in local search results to help users find their favourite restaurant, a top rated hotel with a pool or the best night club.&nbsp;What is a host carousel?&nbsp;When multiple cards are presented from the same site, it is called host carousel. We can, on Google, use structured data to group entities belonging to the following types: Course, Movie, Recipe and Restaurant. There are two options when grouping content: summary pages (these use the schema ItemList class and ListItem that points to separate URLs) and a single, all-in-one-page list where all the elements are on the same page.&nbsp;&nbsp;A Google host carousel for recipesResuscitating a long gone entity in Google\u2019s GraphLet\u2019s start with the beginning of the story. We have been contacted by Jean-Francois Rousset, the SEO Manager for the Stamford American International School in Singapore. Jean-Francois runs his own consultancy business (Blumark SA) and since last August he had been restlessly working on a branding issue that the school had way before involving him as SEO. The Stamford American International School had lost a prominent spot in a Google Entity Carousel for one of their most important queries: \u201cinternational school singapore\u201d. I liked the case and Jean-Francois liked the simplicity of WordLift that could help him improve structured data while focusing on this particular issue.&nbsp;Here is what this post is all about - in the carousel we also see the refinement chips: International school and Singapore.Here below a quick glance at the keyword on Semrush; it was immediately clear to Jean-Francois and our team that having lost the spot in that specific carousel had a clear business impact.&nbsp;How do Google Carousels work?&nbsp;While their presence on the serp is quite relevant, little is known about these list-like rich results. Luckily&nbsp;Bill Slawski had written an article titled \u201cRanked Entities in Search Results at Google\u201d&nbsp; full of insights that helped us understand how things might actually work.&nbsp;According to a patent granted in June 2020, we read on Bill\u2019s article, the flow - when Google receives a query like \u201cinternational schools singapore\u201d - might be as follow:\u00a0from the query to the carouselEntities are extracted from documents that are relevant for the query and, most importantly, a category is also derived from those documents.&nbsp;The first important information is that there is an interplay between pages ranking (the blue links) and entities in the carousel for that query. In our case both the school\u2019s website and the related Wikipedia article were ranking high but still the entity was missing from the carousel.&nbsp;Google Knowledge Graph Reconciliation is a SEO Swiss Knife&nbsp;In context like the one I\u2019m describing here where an entity, originally categorized as \u201cinternational school\u201d ceased to exist, our role as SEO and data publishers is to facilitate the challenging tasks of keeping information consistent and up to date in large scale graphs like Google and Bing. The correctness of data is crucial for all the parties involved (from Google to the University) and is key to provide reliable information to consumers worldwide across different platforms (Google Search and Google Maps for this specific example).&nbsp;Here is what we did to investigate the problem1. Checking the entity in GKGWe started by checking if the entity was present in GKG using the GKG Search API (you can also use this Web App)2. Getting the MREIDs for the entities involved&nbsp;As data gets extracted from multiple sources (unstructured text as well as schematized data) we might find multiple Machine-Readable Entity IDs (MREIDs) that refer to the same thing. In this case we found MREIDs for the entities in the GKG kg:/m/05t00r6 (from the Freebase era) and kg:/g/11fy24_ymv (a newly created entity).3. Analyzing MREIDs&nbsp;By analyzing these MIDs we could find:1. An old Knowledge Graph that was matched with an old Google My Business Account that Google had associated with the entity (previously created from the Wikipedia article of the University) and that could no longer be displayed in the carousel since the address had changed (see \u201cMoved to a new location\u201d below).&nbsp;Here is how the SERP was when we tried to open kgmid=/m/05t00r62. A new Knowledge Graph presumably related to the new Google My Business entity that the school had created when changing the address of the main campus.Here is the information behind the new entity kgmid=/g/11fy24_ymv (with a KP still to be claimed)The problem and the solutionA University is a localBusiness and Google My Business is, for all local businesses, the Entry Point In Google\u2019s Knowledge Graph. The previously existing entity had been reconciled with a GMB that was no longer active and that Google could not use in the carousel.\u201cFor local businesses, there\u2019s a separate process of claiming [entities] that operates through Google My Business.\u201d- Danny Sullivan Google Blog&nbsp;Entity linking and disambiguation&nbsp;We immediately began by helping Google connect:the two entities in its graph,&nbsp;the article in Wikipedia (and the related entity in Wikidata)the social media presence (Facebook in particular was used as a source for the logo of the entity) and&nbsp;the official websiteWe did this by publishing structured linked data (using WordLift) using sameAs links and by contributing the same data to Wikidata.&nbsp; Here is important to remember that we optimize the homepage to improve its position on the target query \"international school Singapore\" before improving the structured data.  Unfortunately we didn\u2019t have the chance of resuming the old Google My Business account (it had been lost as different people got involved in its management).&nbsp;A few weeks later the entity was \u201cmagically\u201d reintroduced in the carousel: it was a positive sign but the battle wasn\u2019t over yet. Unfortunately, by selecting the resuscitated entity from the carousel, the old GMB would appear with the wrong address \ud83d\ude28.At this point we decided to contact Google My Business support in order to make the last step: replacing the old GMB entity with the new one while preserving the connection with the old entity (the one that was originally created from the article in Wikipedia).&nbsp;This was not a trivial task: GMB support does have the faculty of merging duplicates but, in our case, we needed to merge the old with the new GMB while preserving the link to the Wikipedia-entity as that entity was being used by Google Search on the carousel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was clear to us that search features like the ranked list of entities is beyond the control that the GMB team has and we therefore emphasized the importance of improving data quality; they could not have a GMB entry for an institution without the link to a Wikipedia article when there is a Wikipedia article. This was indeed creating a messy experience for their users in the first place.&nbsp;The email we received from Google My Business SupportA few days later we got the response from GMB support that the mission was accomplished: the old entity had been merged with the new Google My Business entity.&nbsp;&nbsp;the final resultLesson learnedGoogle (via GMB support) can intervene on entities in the knowledge graph that are matched with entities created using Google My Business;The first level support of GMB will need to escalate the request to a higher level;&nbsp;The best way to make your request escalate is to let the first Googler understand the importance of data-quality within your specific context;&nbsp;Having a Wikipedia page might help you get in the right carousel but also makes it harder to manage your brand SERP (you have less control over it);Using structured linked data in combination with Wikipedia helps with entity disambiguation and interlinking;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ten blue are used along with, entities extracted from these blue links, to build carousels, so don\u2019t forget to do on-page SEO for the target query.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ready to earn your spot on Google's Entity Carousel?We have a VIP service that can resolve the most complex SEO issues.

        "text": "Does structured data create a competitive advantage in SEO? Adding structured data to your website can be a wise move for your digital marketing if you want to gain organic traffic from search engines. In this article, we will discuss the reasons why nowadays you need structured data to compete on the SERP, what's the impact of structured data and what's its usage around the web. The ROI of Structured Datahttps://youtu.be/TGMzXWxDM4k?t=184A short premiseMarketing is all about intercepting the right potential clients to increase sales of products or services. Under the names of different techniques and tactics, that's it really. Digital marketing and SEO are no exceptions to this rule. In the end of the day, marketers and business owners need to know how the marketing effort is going to pay back. Structured data and knowledge graphs are the core of our SEO services, here at WordLift, and working with a wide range of clients from different countries and industries, there are a few questions that occur quite often:What's the impact of structured data on my site in terms of ROI?How do I measure the impact of structured data on my SEO strategy?What's the real business value that comes with structured data? The point, behind each of these questions is: how does structured data impact my bottom line? Although the answer can be very specific for each business, combined with the characteristics of its website and vertical, it's generally true that structured data nowadays can create a competitive advantage SEO, content findability, and content reuse. Furthermore, if you are a local business structured data are a powerful weapon to enter the Google Knowledge Graph by deploying your identity on Google My Business. How? We recently did an experiment that kicked back impressive results on local SEO schema markup. Isn't it exciting?What's the impact of structured data on SEO?Recently, Google\u2019s Search Liaison, Danny Sullivan, clarified that structured data is optional and does not impact search rankings. Although the context of this conversation was very specific (adding the property \"calories\" to a recipe), the case can be considered paradigmatic of Google approach. If fact, the official Twitter account of Google Search Liaison states that structured data is an option and that it is not required for rankings, BUT also adds that... \"Using it may simply help pages that already rank well appear more attractive to potential visitors\" \u2014 In fact structured data allows Google present content as rich results which highlight that content on the SERP and therefore results in more clicks. \"Aside from web page listings, Google Search may have some special features where certain basic structured data is required to be eligible to appear, such as carousels.\"As John Mu said once...https://twitter.com/JohnMu/status/980902538865205248So, there is actually an impact in SEO results when you use structured data as schema.org markup makes your content eligible for specific rich results and SERP features \u2014 which help your pages gain a higher CTR. Moreover, as suggested by John Mu within the tweet above, structured data helps search engines understand web content and serve them to the right users at the right time. The advantages of structured data go far beyond SEO, and also include opportunities of content reuse, internal findabilty, and semantic analytics. How many sites are using schema.org in 2020?Our partner Woorank has crawled more than 20 million websites and checked how many of them are using schema.org today. As you can guess from the graph below, the web is adapting quite slowly to structured data. Worldwide schema.org usage covers less than one third of the websites \u2014 and frontline runners, USA and France, are just slightly above the 40%. This statistic alone can say that in this context schema.org markup can create a competitive advantage on the SERP. But there's more. It's not just about quantity, it's about quality[et_pb_section fb_built=\"1\" admin_label=\"section\" _builder_version=\"3.22\"][et_pb_row admin_label=\"row\" _builder_version=\"3.25\" background_size=\"initial\" background_position=\"top_left\" background_repeat=\"repeat\"][et_pb_column _builder_version=\"4.4.7\" type=\"4_4\"][et_pb_testimonial author=\"Matt Diggity\" job_title=\"SEO Specialist\" company_name=\"Diggity Marketing\" url=\"https://diggitymarketing.com/\" _builder_version=\"4.4.7\" hover_enabled=\"0\" alt=\"Matt Diggity\" title_text=\"Matt Diggity\" portrait_url=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/matt.png\"]Excellent tool for Structured MarkupWordLift creates structured markup just as good (if not better) than manual generation. I've started recommending it during my consultations and clients are reporting great results.[/et_pb_testimonial][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][/et_pb_section]Many sites use schema.org to add a very basic markup. What can make a difference here is:How much granular and accurate the structured data is?What do you do with the data you are publishing?Are you building a knowledge graph that allows you to reuse your data and content?Quality is crucial, so you may want to consider using one of these structured data testing tools to validate your markup on your web pages.When you move from a quantity to a quality perspective, a whole new world opens up. \"While Google is sunsetting the support for data-vocabulary.org and we see an increasing usage of structured data in general, the focus becomes data quality. Are we prioritizing the highest converting content on our website? Is the data that we're adding to our pages both clean and useful, from a search engine perspective?

        "text": "AMP &amp; Structured Data: Optimize AMP Pages with Schema.org Page Speed is the\u00a0unquestionable strength\u00a0of Accelerated Mobile Pages. This factor gives these pages an incredible boost in mobile SEO\u00a0and in CTR. What can you do to further optimize your AMP pages? Here is where structured data in the form of schema.org markup comes into play.Before we go deep into why structured data can be a not-so-obvious way to boost your AMP pages, let's answer a simple question: what are Accelerated Mobile Pages and why are they so important?AMP: the open-source library that speeds up your mobile pagesLaunched by Google in 2015,\u00a0AMP is an open-source library that allows developers to create web pages that load almost instantaneously on mobile browsers. In other words,\u00a0speed is a crucial factor that AMP aims to optimize.To understand why the speed factor is so important nowadays - especially after Google rolled out\u00a0its mobile-first index - you have to think about how users are browsing the web and, therefore, how Google is trying to offer them a better search experience.In 2018, mobile search has taken the lead over desktop search: 67%\u00a0of worldwide visits are performed using mobile devices according to Stone Temple.What do mobile users want? Speed!Yep, it is as simple as that. 53% of mobile users leave a page after 3 seconds of loading. Does that sound exaggerated? Think about yourself, looking for a piece of information or news for a quick read and waiting in front of your tiny smartphone display for seconds that feel like minutes.#AMP &amp; #PageSpeed What do mobile users want? Speed! 53% of mobile users leave a page after 3 seconds of loading! Click To TweetI think you already know that frustrating feeling. In fact, 75% of mobile websites take 10 or more seconds to load.By giving AMP pages a place of honor on its SERPs, Google is trying to guarantee its users a better search experience.By implementing AMP on your website, you can: \tOvercome your mobile speed issues \tGive a better user experience to your readers \tIncentivize Google to show your pages first instead of the slow-loading pages of the majority of your competitors \tYour website will be eligible for visual stories, and rich result features, such as image, logo or headline, for instance\u00a0 \tWebsite might be able to be shown in mobile Search results as rich results  \tSee your news featured in the top news carousel, if you are a news publisherThis is example of how Top Stories Carousel looks like with AMPTo prove why implementing AMP on your website is important, here are some basic figures taken from research conducted by TechJury in 2019 on mobile vs Desktop use. The numbers clearly indicate that mobile market share worldwide is 52.1% in comparison to desktop market share of 44.2%. What is not surprising is that Millennials spend about 3 hours and 45 minutes browsing on their mobile devices per day in 2019. It is highly unlikely that the number will decrease in 2020.Here is another similar research by AMP Project, and it indicates that E-commerce websites which are using AMP, experienced a 20% increase in sales conversions compared to non-AMP pages. Still doubting whether you need to implement AMP?Canonical page or native AMP?To avoid duplicate content issues, Google requires each AMP page to be linked to its canonical non-AMP version, and the canonical page has to link back to the AMP page.Here is the code that does the trickIn the AMP\u00a0page you should place:&lt;link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"https://www.example.com/url/to/full/document.html\"&gt;In the canonical page you should place:&lt;link rel=\"amphtml\" href=\"https://www.example.com/url/to/amp/document.html\"&gt;In case the page is native-AMP, meaning that there isn't another page for desktop devices, the canonical should be the AMP page itself. This could become a smart option in the future for websites whose traffic and business model is mostly mobile based.#AMP A native-AMP website could become a smart option in the next future for those websites whose traffic and business model is mostly mobile-focused.  Click To TweetWhy adding structured data to AMP pages can make the differenceAdding schema.org markup to AMP is recommended by Google itself. In their guide of how to enhance AMP for Google Search, they begin with:You can enhance your AMP content for Google Search by creating a basic AMP page, adding structured data, monitoring your pages, and practicing with codelabs.And later in the same article:Use structured data to enhance the appearance of your page in Google mobile search results. AMP pages with structured data can appear in rich results in mobile search, like the Top stories carousel or host carousel.What exactly does \"enhance the appearance of your page in Google mobile search\" mean? As you can see in the example below, the page of SalzburgerLand Partners Meeting on WordLift Blog is an entity of the\u00a0Event type. Below the link, you can see that Google features some basic metadata such as place and date. This gives users extra information and adds one more reason for them to click on the content.The same thing can be done with different types of entities: for example, imagine products coming with their price and availability information.How to add structured data to your AMP pagesGoogle Search recommends to use the same structured data markup for both the canonical and the AMP pages:Use the same structured data markup across both the canonical and AMP pages.This means that if you want to benefit from semantic SEO\u00a0techniques on your AMP pages, you have to align the structured data of your AMP version to the canonical page. If you have invested some time with the schema.org markup of your content, it would be a shame not doing so!AMP Project suggests to include in the structured data of your AMP at least these four schema.org properties to make your AMP pages more easy to find: \tthe specific type of content (i.e. \u2018news article\u2019) \tthe headline \tthe published date \tassociated preview images.Of course, the richer your structured data is, the more that Google Search will understand the content on your page and be able to help you reach the right target audience. If you are not sure if the structured data parses correctly, you can use these tools to test structured data.The more your #StructuredData is rich, the more Google Search will understand the content on your page and help you reach the right target audience. #SchemaOrg Click To TweetIf you are using WordPress, you may already know that thanks to the plugin AMP for WordPress you can turn any of your pages or articles into an AMP page.There are many other plugins that do the same thing, but we recommend you to chose this exact one because it comes from the first strict cooperation between Google and Wordpress. In fact, the Google AMP team is the same team that is working to empower the WordPress ecosystem. One of the first results of this cooperation is the AMP for WordPress plugin created by Automatic, our friends at XWP (a leading WP developing agency) and Google itself. Here some some cool new updates that your website can benefit from: \tGutenberg Support \tDivi Support\u00a0 \tAMP Stories \tImproved CSS Optimization \tGoogle Fonts Support For All Designs \tAMP Infinite Scroll Support \tPhoto Gallery by 10Web Support \tMEWE social network Support[et_pb_section global_module=\"8775\"][/et_pb_section]From now on with WordLift, your AMP pages can finally inherit the schema.org markup of the canonical page\u00a0and share the same JSON-LD. Simply put, after you add the structured data to your article, WordLift will automatically implement all the metadata in the corresponding AMP pages.Using our plugin, structured data for AMP is quite simple. Have a look at this schema.org markup of an AMP post on the blog of our sister company InsideOut Today.Above you can see the linked data from the JSON-LD of a blog post about the Opportunities &amp; challenges for the Arab media industry. See also the canonical page. Wrapping up: the benefits of structured data on AMP pagesUsing the same markup for AMP pages and canonical pages, you will benefit from the advantages of a mobile-optimized\u00a0page - since Google index is more and more focused on mobile performances - and also from the extra help of semantic SEO.\u00a0Boom! You can kill two birds with one stone.As we have seen before, AMP speeds up a website's load time and therefore it increases mobile ranking, which affects the CTR. Users are more likely to click on the results that are more prominent on the SERP.Wait, there's more! A fast loading page will also have a lower bounce rate. Here the advantage is twofold: your users will benefit from a better UX and search engines will register the high dwell time as a positive signal - helping you to strengthen your website rankings.#AMP speeds up a website load time. This means: better rankings, higher CTR and lower bounce rate. Boom!  Click To TweetOn the other side, enriching your AMP pages with structured data will help search engines better understand your content and also give them enough metadata to display your pages as rich snippets on the SERP. Guess what? This will guarantee you even a higher CTR.[et_pb_section global_module=\"8767\"][/et_pb_section]",

        "text": "Localized Content Marketing for Local Businesses - What You Can Blog About If you own a local business you may have been wondering how you can direct the right customers to your website. You might be looking into localized content marketing but you're just not sure where to start or what sort of content to provide. You\u2019ve probably even heard that you should be blogging, right?In this article, we\u2019re going to be talking about why localized&nbsp;content marketing for businesses is so important, and we\u2019ll be sharing some ideas you can use to attract your ideal customers to your blog.So many local businesses still overlook the power of localized&nbsp;content marketing. But you won\u2019t! By getting your content strategy in place now, you can stay strides ahead of your local competition.Why do local businesses need a localized content marketing strategy?You might be wondering why your local business would need a localized&nbsp;content marketing strategy when the majority of your customers are already&nbsp;locals. Especially if they know you through reputation or word of mouth. Well, I\u2019ll ask you this\u2026 Wouldn\u2019t you like more customers?&nbsp;It\u2019s important that your business can be found easily online. 72% of consumers who performed a local search visited a store within five miles and 28% of those visits ended in a purchase. So, it pays to be seen in the SERPs.Here are just a few benefits of having a local content marketing strategy: \tYou can reach even more people in your local area \tYou\u2019ll build trust and familiarity with people who may not have previously heard of your business \tYou can be more easily identified by visitors or newcomers to your local area. \tYou\u2019ll improve your domain authority and SEO \tIt\u2019s a great opportunity to build your email list among local people \tIt increases engagement with your ideal customer and keeps you in the forefront of their minds \tIt means you can retarget local readers with social media ads \tYou\u2019ll have content to share on your platforms \tYou can build internal links for on-page SEO through your blogs \tWebsites with a blog have 434% more indexed pages and generate up to 126% more leadsIf that has not convinced you, there\u2019s nothing that will.&nbsp;Bonus tip: A good content strategy drives traffic to your website. If you don\u2019t already have a self hosted site with your own domain name, now is the time to get one so your business can be more professional and memorable.What should a local business blog about?The key to writing blog posts that attract local people is either creating content that will specifically interest locals, such as things related to the City or the town your business operates in, or creating content around popular keywords that people in your area are searching for.While keywords are important, it\u2019s even more important to create engaging content that your ideal customers will want to read and share with their friends. So, let\u2019s take a look at some things you can blog about\u2026Share your storyThis one is a great idea for your first blog post. Introduce yourself, your business and share your story. How did you get started? What makes you different? Do you have any funny anecdotes about your business journey?&nbsp;Stories like this humanise your brand, making your business feel more friendly, positive and approachable. Which is exactly the type of business local shoppers appreciate.Your expertiseIt is likely that you are more knowledgeable about your field of business than most of your customers. Share your expertise with your audience by blogging about things that they might find useful, such as \u2018how to\u2019 guides, or posts that offer solutions to problems they might have.&nbsp;If you are a cleaning company, share your knowledge about how to remove mold, clean at the end of a tenancy, or make an oven look new again.&nbsp;A person searching for these tips online is likely to need the services of a cleaner. Even if they don\u2019t need anything but advice from you now, you\u2019ll be in the forefront of their minds when they do.Share the success story of one of your customersShare before and after pictures of a project you have been working on. If you are a builder or decorator, it could be a renovation project. If you are a hairdresser, the customer who\u2019s look you\u2019ve drastically changed. And gardeners could share before and after pictures of landscaping projects.Top 10 Best In your CityCreate a list of 10 of the best shops/restaurants/events/art galleries in your city. The key here is not to list your direct competitors, but other local businesses that your customers would find useful. So, if you run a wedding venue, list the top 10 florists in the area.&nbsp;People love to celebrate their local area. These kinds of posts help them do just that. And, you have the added benefit that the businesses you mention are likely to share your content on their social media channels or reciprocate by including your business in their future content.Interviews with local expertsWe\u2019re talking local heroes, business owners working in related fields, academics and researchers. Anyone who has something relevant to say that your audience will care about.&nbsp;Thinking back to our cleaning company, something their audience would find useful is an interview with local estate agents about \u2018end of tenancy cleaning mistakes people often make\u2019.&nbsp;Local events and activities - What\u2019s on this month in *Your City*Create a list of events and activities in your area. This is the type of blog post that is likely to get lots of shares on social media from locals. You can capitalize on this by inviting them to like your page, including your business\u2019s details in the post, or placing links to your key landing pages.Final ThoughtsDigital marketing is an important part of your business, regardless of whether you are a global or local brand. Localized&nbsp;Content marketing can be a great way to organically reach new customers. It\u2019s easy to get started, so all local businesses should be taking advantage of this strategy to stay ahead of their competitors.

        "text": "Schema Markup to Boost Local SEO Is it really worth it?&nbsp;Let\u2019s start with the end. In the experiment I am sharing today we measured the impact of a specific improvement on the structured data of a website that references 500+ Local Business (more specifically the site promotes Lodging Business such as hotels and villas for rent). Before diving into the solution; let\u2019s have a look at the results that we obtained using a Causal Impact analysis. If you are a marketing person or an SEO you constantly struggle to measure the impact of your actions in the most precise and irrefutable way; Casual Impact, a methodology originally introduced by Google, helps you exactly with this. It\u2019s a statistical analysis that builds a Bayesian structural time series model that helps you isolate the impact of a single change being made on a digital platform.&nbsp;Cumulative result achieved after the first week (click data exported from GSC).In a week, after improving the existing markup, we could see a positive increase of +5.09% of clicks coming from Google Search - this improvement is statistically relevant, unlikely to be due to random fluctuations and the probability of obtaining this effect by chance is very small \ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25We did two major improvements to the markup of these local businesses:&nbsp;Improve the quality of NAP (Name, Address and Phone number) by reconciling the entities with entities in Google My Business (viia Google Maps APIs) and by making sure we had the same data Google has or better;Adding, for all the reconciled entities, the hasMap property with a direct link to the Google CID Number (Customer ID Number), this is an important identifier that&nbsp; business owners and webmasters should know - it helps Google match entities found by crawling structured data with entities in GMB.&nbsp;Problem StatementGoogle My Business is indeed the simplest and most effective way for a local business to enter the Google Knowledge Graph. If your site operates in the travel sector or provides users with immediate access to hundreds of local businesses, what should you do to market your pages using schema markup against a fierce competition made of the business themselves or large brands such as booking.com and tripadvisors.com?How can you be more relevant for both travelers abroad searching for their dream holiday in another country and for locals trying to escape from large urban areas?ApproachThe approach, in most of our projects, is the same regardless of the vertical we work for: knowledge completion and entity reconciliation; these really are two essential building blocks of our SEO strategy.&nbsp;By providing more precise information in the form of structured linked data we are helping search engines find the searchers we\u2019re looking for, at the best time of their customer journey.&nbsp;Another important aspect is that, while we\u2019re keen on automating SEO (and data curation in general), we understand the importance of the continuous feedback loop between humans and machines: domain experts need to be able to validate the output and to correct any inaccurate predictions that the machine might produce.&nbsp;There is no way out - tools like WordLift needs to facilitate the process and web scale it but they cannot replace human knowledge and human validation (not yet at least).&nbsp;Agentive SEO = Human-in-the-Loop&nbsp;The SolutionLocalBusiness markup works for different types of businesses from a retail shop to a luxury hotel or a shopping center and it comes with sub-types (here is the full list of the different variants from the schema.org website).&nbsp;All the sub-types, when it comes to SEO and Google in particular, shall contain the following set of information:&nbsp;Name, Address and Phone number (and here consistency plays a big role and we want to ensure that the same entity on Yelp shows the same data on Apple Maps, Google, Bing and all the other directories that clients might use)Reference to the official website (this becomes particularly relevant if the publisher does not coincide with the business owner)&nbsp;Reference to the Google My Business entity (the 5% lift - we have seen above is indeed related to this specific piece of information) using the hasMap propertyLocation data (and here, as you might image, we can do a lot more than just adding the address as a string of text)The JSON-LD behind a Local Business&nbsp;Here is the gist.Google My Business reconciliationIn order to improve the markup and to add the hasMap property on hundreds of pages we\u2019ve added a new functionality in WordLift\u2019s WordPress plugin (that also works already for non-WordPress websites) that helps editors:&nbsp;Trigger the reconciliation using Google Maps APIsReview/Approve the suggestions&nbsp;Improve structured data markup for Local BusinessGoogle My Business Reconciliation by WordLiftFrom the screen below the editor can either \u201cAccept\u201d or \u201cDiscard\u201d the provided suggestions.&nbsp;WordLift reconciles an entity with a loose match with the name of the business, the address and/or the phone number.&nbsp;Improving the name of the local business by adding a new alias, adding the hasMap and the International Phone&nbsp; numberAdding location markup using containedInPlace/containsPlace and linked dataAs seen in the json-ld above we have added - in a previous iteration (and independently from the testing that was done this time) two important properties:containedInPlace and&nbsp;the inverse-property containsPlace (on the pages related to villages and regions) to help search engines clearly understand the location of the local businesses.&nbsp;This data is also very helpful to compose the breadcrumbs as it will help the searcher understand and confirm the location of a business. Most of us, still make searches like \u201cWordLift, Rome\u201d to find a local business and more likely we will click on results where we can confirm that - yes, WordLift office is indeed located in Italy &gt; Lazio &gt; Rome.The administrative divisions in GeoNames for the rione Regola in Rome where our office is locatedTo extract this information along with the sameAs links to Wikidata and GeoNames (one of the largest geographical databases with more than 11 million locations) we used our linked data stack and an extension called WordLift Geo to automatically populate the knowledge graph and the JSON-LD with the containedInPlace and containsPlace properties.&nbsp;Are you dealing with geographical data on your website?

        "text": "Structured Data Testing Tool Bye Bye! Top 6 alternatives to validate your markup Google\u2019s decision to shut down the Structured Data Testing Tool to enhance Rich Results Test usage has raised an engaging debate in the world of SEO. Is this good news for experts around the world or it\u2019s time to look for better alternatives? We might have the answer to this question.On July 7, 2020, Google announced the upcoming shutdown of the Structured Data Testing Tool, an instrument widely used to date by SEO experts to verify the correct implementation of the structured data on a webpage. The decision is closely linked to the announcement of the release from the beta version of a new, more effective, testing tool, Rich Results Test. As Google explains:\u201cRich results are experiences on Google Search that go beyond the standard blue link. They\u2019re powered by structured data and can include carousels, images, or other non-textual elements. Over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve developed the Rich Results Test to help you test your structured data and preview your rich results.\u201dTo announce the transition from one tool to another, Google has also added a new message to the closing tool.https://twitter.com/cyberandy/status/1280525033979469825As you can read in the official documentation, the new tool brings more advantages to the analysis and more targeted advice on improving structured data, including:Showing which Search feature enhancements are valid for the markup you are providingHandling dynamically loaded structured data markup more effectivelyRendering both mobile and desktop versions of a resultIt is fully aligned with Search Console reportsThe tool can be used to test both code snippets and web page URLs and provides users with errors and warnings. The errors prevent a page from being displayed with the multimedia results in SERP, while the warnings indicate that one or more elements concerned will not be shown in the rich results. For example, as specified in the documentation, if there was a warning for a missing image property, that page could still appear as a rich result, just without an image.The analysis of valid structured data on Rich Results TestHere's how the new tool highlights errors and helps you improve themAs announced by Google earlier this month, Rich Results Test is finally out of beta and fully supports all Google Search rich result features. The tool was born in 2017 as a solution to test rich snippets, rich cards, and all other multimedia search results. When it was launched, however, it only supported four types of structured data: recipes, job listings, films, and courses. It has now been updated and finally supports all types of structured data that can be seen in SERP on Google.Rich Results Test: is it the best solution to test structured data? What are the limits of the tool?Rich Results Test is ready to replace the old Structured Data Testing Tool. Is it good news? For now only in part, as the international SEO consultant Aleyda Solis points out in a tweet:https://twitter.com/aleyda/status/1280584182285172736?s=20When Aleyda Solis wrote this feedback it was clear that Rich Results Test wouldn\u2019t support all types of structured data, but only those that trigger Google Rich Results. Turns out she wasn\u2019t the only one raising the issue and this week Google's John Mueller said that the company heard the feedbacks and that \"we are planning on expanding the Rich Results Testing Tool.\"As he explained, the original idea was to simplify the job for those who were only interested in the \u201ctypes of structured data that actually have an effect in search. And that's why we focus on the Rich Results Tool which focuses on the things that we would show as Google in the search results.\u201d But SEO experts want it all. We\u2019ll stay updated to learn more about future improvements to the new testing tools.However, the launching of a new tool is always an exciting time to discover new features and understand how they can help us improve our content to win the front row seats on Google Search, especially if we are talking about Rich Results. But it also opens up an important question: what if there are other, better, tools out there? Let's take off the tooth right away and find out the best alternatives outside the Googleplex.Top Structured Data Testing ToolsFirst of all: do you really need to use a structured data testing tool? Absolutely yes. These testing tools are extremely useful as they give you a lot of important information on the deployment of the structured data in your web pages, providing insights about how the search engines read these data and if they are eligible for Rich Results. Of course, each testing tool is different and can help you improve your structured data through several features. Let's take a look at the most interesting structured data testing tool out there. SEO Site Checkup Yandex Structured Data ValidatorRDF TranslatorJSON-LD PlaygroundBing Markup ValidatorStructured Data LinterSEO Site CheckupPrice: $39.95 with a 14-day free trialSEO SiteCheckup is a website analysis tool that contains more than one tool, including the \"dear old\" Structured Data Testing Tool, in one-window service. All you need to do is paste the URL of the site and click Checkup to validate the structured data, check the schema usage, monitor your website SEO, and display any issues that need to be fixed such as page load speed, URL redirects, and mobile responsiveness.Yandex Structured Data ValidatorPrice: FreeIf you think you\u2019ll miss the Structured Data Testing Tool, Yandex Structured Data Validator is a suitable alternative as is very similar to the Google tool. Along with check the markup on your site, this site helps you monitor how the structured data is processed and \u201cseen\u201d by search engines and whether the crawlers will be able to extract the information present in the structured data.&nbsp;RDF TranslatorPrice: FreeRDF Translator is a multi-format conversion tool for structured markup. The main value of this tool is that, unlike most other free tools out there, it supports data formats such as XML, N3, and N-Triples. Along with the use of RDF Translator to validate your structured data, you can also incorporate the tool on your website, as it comes with REST API for developers.JSON-LD PlaygroundPrice: FreeIt comes by itself that JSON-LD Playground is the best tool for validating JSON-LD structured data format. The use is quite simple: you just have to enter the markup code with &lt;script type=\u2019application/ld+json\u2018&gt; or the URL of the remote document and wait to get a detailed report.Bing Markup ValidatorPrice: FreeBing Markup Validator is a part of the Bing Webmaster Tools that also includes SEO Analyzer and Keyword Research Tool. This tool is particularly useful to verify your webpages markup and get an on-demand report that helps you validate different types of structured data such as HTML Microdata, RDFa, JSON-LD, OpenGraph, and Schema.org.Structured Data LinterPrice: FreeStructured Data Linter is a pretty minimalistic tool that helps you verify the structured data present in your web pages by simply pasting the URL of a page or a code or by just uploading a file. It supports RDFa and JSON-LD but at the moment does not support microformats.We\u2019ve seen the best alternative to Google\u2019s Rich Results Testing Tool, but what about data quality monitoring?Ok, at this point you have an overview of the new Rich Results Tool and of the most suitable alternatives out there that will help you check the markup in your web pages.

At the end, I will give you a script to help you write meta descriptions on scale using BERT: Google\u2019s pre-trained, unsupervised language model that has recently gained great momentum in the SEO community after both, Google and BING announced that they use it for providing more useful results.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\rI used to underestimate the importance of meta descriptions myself: after all Google will use it only on 35.9% of the cases (according to a Moz analysis from last year by the illustrious @dr_pete). In reality, these brief snippets of text, greatly help to entice more users to your website and, indirectly, might even influence your ranking thanks to higher click-through-rate (CTR).\u00a0\r\rWhile Google can overrule the meta descriptions added in the HTML of your pages, if you properly align:\r\r \tthe main intent of the user (the query you are targeting),\u00a0\r \tthe title of the page and\r \tthe meta description\u00a0\r\rThere are many possibilities to improve the CTR on Google\u2019s result pages. In the course of this article we will investigate the following aspects and, since it\u2019s a long article, feel free to jump to the section that interests you the most -- code is available at the end.\rWhat are meta descriptions?\rAs usual I tend to \u201cask\u201d\u00a0 \u201cexperts\u201d online a definition to get started, and with a simple query on Google, we can get this definition from our friends at WooRank:\r\rMeta descriptions are HTML tags that appear in the head section of a web page. The content within the tag provides a description of what the page and its content are about. In the context of SEO, meta descriptions should be around 160 characters long.\r\r\r\rHere\u2019s an example of what a meta description usually looks like (from that same article):\r\r\rHow long should your meta description be?\rWe want to be, as with any other content on our site, authentic, conversational and user-friendly. Having said that, in 2020, you will want to stick to the 155-160 characters limit (this corresponds to 920 pixels). We also want to keep in mind that the \u201coptimal\u201d length might change based on the query of the user. This means that you should really do your best in the first 120 characters and think in terms of creating a meaningful chain by linking the query, the title tag and the meta description. In some cases, within this chain it is also very important to consider the role of the breadcrumbs. As in the example above from WooRank I can quickly see that the definition is coming from an educational page of their site: this fits very well with my information request.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\rWhat meta descriptions should we focus on?\rSEO is a process: we need to set our goals, analyze the data we\u2019re starting with, improve our content, and measure the results. There is no point in looking at a large website and saying, I need to write a gazillion of meta descriptions since they are all missing. It would simply be a waste of time.\r\rBesides the fact that in some cases - we might decide not to add a meta description at all. For example, when a page covers different queries and the text is already well structured we might leave it to Google to craft the best snippet for each super query (they are super good at it ?). We need to look at the critical pages we have - let\u2019s not forget that writing a good meta description is just like writing an ad copy \u2014 driving clicks is not a trivial game.\r\rAs a rule of thumb I prefer to focus my attention on:\u00a0\r\r \tPages that are already ranking on Google (position &gt; 0); adding a meta description to a page that is not ranking will not make a difference.\r \tPages that are not in the top 3 positions: if they are already highly ranked, unless I can see some real opportunities - I prefer to leave them as they are.\r \tPages that have a business value: on the wordlift website (the company I work for), there is no point in adding meta descriptions to landing pages that have no organic potential. I would rather prefer to focus on content from our blog. This varies of course but is very important to understand what type of pages I want to focus on.\r\rThis criteria can be useful, especially if you plan to programmatically crawl our website and choose where to focus our attention using crawl data. Keep on reading and we\u2019ll get there, I promise.\u00a0\rA quick introduction to single-document text summarization\rAutomatic text summarization is a challenging NLP task to provide a short and possibly accurate summary of a long text. While, with the growing amount of online content, the need for understanding and summarizing content is very high. In pure technological terms, the challenge for creating well formed summaries is huge and results are, most of the time, still far from being perfect (or human-level).\r\rThe first research work on automatic text summarization goes back to 50 years ago and various techniques. Since then, they have been used to extract relevant content from unstructured text.\u00a0\u00a0\r\r\u201cThe different dimensions of text summarization can be generally categorized based on its input type (single or multi document), purpose (generic, domain specific, or query-based) and output type (extractive or abstractive).\u201d\r\r\u2014 A Review on Automatic Text Summarization Approaches, 2016.\rExtractive vs Abstractrive\u00a0\rLet\u2019s have a quick look at the different methods we have for compressing a web page.\u00a0\r\r\r\r\u201cExtractive summarization methods work by identifying important sections of the text and generating them verbatim; [\u2026] abstractive summarization methods aim at producing important material in a new way. In other words, they interpret and examine the text using advanced natural language techniques in order to generate a new shorter text that conveys the most critical information from the original text\u201d\r\r\u2014 Text Summarization Techniques: A Brief Survey, 2017.\r\rWith simple words with extractive summarization we will use an algorithm to select and combine the most relevant sentences in a document. Using abstractive summarization methods, we will use sophisticated NLP techniques (i.e. deep neural networks) to read and understand a document in order to generate novel sentences.\u00a0\r\rIn extractive methods a document can be seen as a graph where each sentence is a node and the relationships between these sentences are weighted edges. These edges can be computed by analyzing the similarity between the word-sets from each sentence. We can then use an algorithm like Page Rank (we will call it Text Rank in this context) to extract the most central sentences in our document-graph.\r\r\u00a0\rThe carbon footprint of NLP and why I prefer extractive methods to create meta descriptions\rIn a recent study, researchers at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, performed a life cycle assessment for training several common large AI models with focus on language models and NLP tasks. They found that training a complex language model can emit five times the lifetime emissions of the average American car (including whatever is required to manufacture the car itself!).\u00a0\r\rWhile automation is key we don\u2019t want to contribute to the pollution of\u00a0 our planet by misusing the technology we have. In principle, using abstract methods and deep learning techniques offers a higher degree of control when compressing articles into 30-60 word paragraphs but, considering our end goal (enticing more clicks from organic search), we can probably find a good compromise without spending too many computational (and environmental) resources. I know it sounds a bit na\u00efve but...it is not and we want to be sustainable and efficient in everything we do.\rWhat is BERT?\rBERT: The Mighty Transformer\u00a0\rNow, provided the fact that a significant amount of energy has been already spent to train BERT (1,507 kWh according to the paper mentioned above), I decided it was worth testing it for running extractive summarization.\u00a0\r\r\u00a0\r\rI have also to admit that It has been quite some time since I entertained myself with automatic text-summarization of online content and I have experimented with a lot of different methods before getting into BERT.\u00a0\u00a0\r\rBERT is a pre-trained unsupervised natural language processing model created by Google and released as an open source program (yay!) that does magic on 11 of the most common NLP tasks.\r\rBERTSUM, is a variant of BERT, designed for extractive summarization that is now state-of-the-art (here you can find the paper behind it).\u00a0\r\rDerek Miller, leveraging on these progresses, has done a terrific work for bringing this technology to the masses (myself included) by creating a super sleek and easy-to-use Python library that we can use to experiment BERT-powered extractive text summarization at scale. A big thank you also goes to the HuggingFace team since Derek\u2019s tool uses their Pytorch transformers library ?.\u00a0\rLong live AI, let\u2019s scale the generation of meta descriptions with our adorable robot [CODE IS HERE]\rSo here is how everything works in the code linked to this article.\u00a0\r\r\r\r \tWe start with a CSV that I generated using the WooRank\u2019s crawler (here you can tweak the code and use any CSV that helps you detect where on the site MDs are missing and where it can be useful to add them); the file provided in the code has been made available on Google Drive (this way we can always look at the data before running the script).\r \tWe analyze the data from the crawler and build a dataframe using Pandas.\r \tWe then choose what URLs are more critical: in the code provided I basically work on the analysis of the wordlift.io website and focus only on content from the English blog that has already a ranking position. Feel free to play with the Pandas filters and to infuse your own SEO knowledge and experience to the script.\r \tWe then crawl each page (and here you might want to define the CSS class that the site uses in the HTML to detect the body of the article - hence preventing you from analyzing menus and other unnecessary elements in the page).\r \tWe ask BERT (with a vanilla configuration that you can fine-tune) to generate a summary for each page and to write it on a csv file.\r \tWith the resulting CSV we can head back to our beloved CMS and find the best way to import the data (you might want to curate BERT\u2019s suggestions before actually going live with it - once again - most of the cases we can do better then the machine).\r\rSuper easy, not too intensive in computational terms and...environmentally friendly ?\r\rHave fun playing with it! Always remember, it is a robot friend and not a real replacement of your precious work. BERT can do the heavy lifting of reading the page and highlighting what matters the most but it might still fail in getting the right length or in adding the proper CTA (i.e. \u201cread more to find \u2026\u201d).\rFinal thoughts and future work\rThe beauty of automation and agentive SEO is in general, as I like to call it, that you gain super powers while still remaining in full control of the process. AI is far from being magic or becoming (at least in this context) a replacement for content writers and SEOs, rather AI is a smart assistant that can augment our work.\u00a0\r\rThere are some clear limitations with extractive text summarization that are related to the fact that we deal with sentences and if we have long sentences in our web page, we will end up having a snippet that is far too long to become a perfect meta description. I plan to keep on working to fine-tune the parameters to get the best possible results in terms of expressiveness and length but...so far only a 10-15% is good enough and doesn\u2019t require any extra update from our natural intelligence. A vast majority of the summaries look good and it is substantial but still goes beyond the 160 character limits.\u00a0\r\rThere is, of course, a lot of potential in these summaries beyond the generation of meta descriptions for SEO\u00a0 - we can for instance create a \u201cfeatured snippet\u201d type of experience to provide relevant abstracts to the readers. Moreover, if the tone of the article is conversational enough, the summary might also become a speakable paragraph that we can use to introduce the content on voice-enabled devices (i.e. \u201cwhat is the latest WordLift article about?\u201d). So, while we can\u2019t let the machine really run the show alone, there is a concrete value in using BERT for summarization.\u00a0\rCredits\rAs you arrived to the end of this long article, it is time to remind us all that none of this could be possible without the work of many people and enlightened organizations that are committed to open source technologies and that are enabling and encouraging practitioners around the world to make (well, hopefully) the web a better place!\u00a0\r\rIt is also thanks to mavericks and SEOs with a data-driven mindset like Paul Shapiro and Hamlet that I got interested in the topic and ready to experiment with new tools!\u00a0\r\rGive a spin to the code on the Google Colab and send me any comments or suggestions over Twitter or LinkedIn!\r\rWant to scale your marketing efforts with Woorank and WordLift SEO management service?

        "text": "Off-page SEO techniques still work in 2019 Off-page SEO techniques can be a powerful ally to boost the search engine ranking of your website. We\u2019re not talking just about backlinks, but a whole SEO strategy that includes essentials SEO factors that every competitive business should include in their strategy. Let\u2019s find out more about Off-Page SEO and the latest techniques that work great in 2019.What is Off-Page SEO?Unlike On-Page SEO, Off-page SEO isn't associated with the optimization of content or the website, it rather uses certain techniques to boost the visibility of your website over the Internet. For instance, if Investopedia links with the content of your websites, then some powers of Investopedia will shift to your content link and you will acquire top ranks for that content.Similar to this there are different development techniques used to rank websites known as Off-Page SEO. Let\u2019s go deeper on the subject.SEO is a way utilized to enhance traffic and conversion rates of your website by acquiring high position on SERP like Bing, Google, Yahoo, etc.Now, some CMSs are providing built-in complements with full criteria on the page on the site. For Example, WordPress have plugins such as Yoast, WordLift and SEO Ultimate.However, for off-page tasks, you need to find out the high domain authority websites and develop backlinks with recent articles.What is the main difference between On-Page and Off-Page SEO?There is a significant difference between on-page and off-page SEO. Nowadays if you want to boost your website ranking in search engine results, you must know about&nbsp;all&nbsp;SEOtechniques, and&nbsp;SEO is traditionally divided into two categories: on&nbsp;Page and off Page. \tOn-Page SEO: the&nbsp;on-page&nbsp;SEO techniques (also known as SEO on the site) are meant to optimize different parts of a website and content that affect the&nbsp;search engine rankings. It's something that you have control over and that you can change on your site. \tOff-page SEO: the off-page&nbsp;SEO techniques are&nbsp;focuses on increasing the authority of a domain&nbsp;by obtaining links from other websites.What are the latest Off-page SEO techniques?Research on the latest contentInteresting content rules the Search Engine Optimization sphere. Developing interesting and worth sharing content is a great method to build a high proportion of backlinks to our websites and articles.Tip: frequently research and update your content.Infographics SubmissionDevelop innovative infographics. In the&nbsp;present scenario, infographics are becoming popular over the web. Submit your infographic to specialized websites and offer reference to your articles and webpages. The dimensions of the image vary with different websites.Article and Press Release SubmissionSubmit your&nbsp;articles to press release and&nbsp;article submission directories. You can also add&nbsp;links to your website.Tip: ensure that your article is 100% unique and is of top-notch&nbsp;quality.

        "text": "How To Turn Web SEO Know-how Into A Successful YouTube Channel If you\u2019ve ever spent time thinking about marketing, you know how important it is to find new uses for old tools. But how can you use something as specific as SEO knowledge in other parts of your marketing strategy? Could you find a way to translate that knowledge into other channels?YouTube has become a media juggernaut. Whether you go there to get entertainment, follow news, connect with people, or learn a new skill, YouTube has established itself as the first (and, in some cases, only) place people go for content.Don\u2019t believe me? According to Hootsuite, 2 billion people log into YouTube every month. Each of them spends (on average) at least 11 minutes on YouTube each day. And each of these visits averages to 6.5 page views.&nbsp;One common misconception about popular YouTube channels is that they found success because of a single viral video.&nbsp;That may be true of content creators who make travel videos, share DIY tutorials, or play music. But most \u201cbusiness\u201d channels on YouTube find success because they came into the platform with a strategy.There are ideas and concepts shared by those channels, and today I\u2019ll break down four easy steps to build a successful YouTube channel using SEO best practices that you probably already use.Step #1. Know Your Target MarketBefore your web content can rank on Google, you\u2019ve got to know what your target audience is searching for. Keyword research is an absolutely essential tool for digital marketers, because it\u2019s how we find where our products or services intersect with what our target audience is looking for.You can transfer that same mindset to your YouTube channel. We now know that YouTube is the second most popular search engine (I\u2019ll let you guess which is number one), and that means the only way to make sure people find your content is by positioning it in a way that will outrank the millions of videos already covering the topics you care about.There is a whole fleet of YouTube keyword tools out there that will help you do this, and all of them offer different perks. But there is also something you can explore on your own without investing into a third-party app:Use the search bar to see what\u2019s trending nowType in your desired keyword and let the autofill suggestions tell you which long-tail keywords are popular on YouTube. You won\u2019t have a full breakdown of related keywords, but it\u2019s an entry point into YouTube SEO that anyone can do.Step #2. Check Out The CompetitionNo company will find (and maintain) success without getting very familiar with other brands in the same market. That\u2019s not an SEO secret by any means, but it\u2019s something that can easily help you improve your success rate on YouTube.YouTube actually makes this process easy. You can easily research competitors by going to their channels, browsing through videos that match your own target keywords, and seeing which tags are used. Which brings me to Step #3.Step #3. Choose Your Tags CarefullyIt can be tempting to tag a video with every keyword imaginable. If Google SEO can pick out multiple keywords in a single piece of content, we tend to think YouTube would just use the same algorithms as the site\u2019s parent company.&nbsp;&nbsp;After all, that\u2019s how you can get the video to show up in the most searches, right?Wrong. YouTube\u2019s algorithms have evolved a lot \u2014 not quite the same as Google\u2019s, but close enough that the same strategy can apply to both. You want to base your video tag selection around the keyword, using only a couple of long-tail versions.Here\u2019s an example: You made a video about a new social media posting tool. If you use 35 different tags that mention every possible related keyword, YouTube will assume your video covers a lot of topics in a very shallow way.On the other hand, what if you stick to a handful of keywords that are all fairly similar to the video or your channel? Well, in that case YouTube will read that as being a deeper, more authoritative piece of content about a very focused topic.It works just like traditional SEO practices. And while there is no hard and fast ruling on how many tags to use, there is research that shows that using fewer keyword tags helps videos rank better in YouTube search results.Step #4. Get Out Of Your Comfort ZoneThe only way to establish your voice on YouTube is to build engagement with your audience. Viewers won\u2019t remember how educational your videos are or how much expertise you bring to the field. But if you drop a call to action at the end of your video, you might just convince them to answer a question in a comment, share the video with a friend, or click through to learn more about your product or service.\u201cEngagement\u201d has become a keyword for social media marketing. And with YouTube becoming a key platform for social media, companies are now chasing audience engagement on their video channels like never before.As the market becomes more and more saturated with brands investing in video marketing, consumers are learning to avoid static companies and looking for options who feel a little more accessible or personable.People won\u2019t just watch a video and decide your company is perfect for their needs \u2014 they\u2019ll want some kind of interaction, or at least to know that you are actively engaging with people. That might be showing up in the comments, creating videos to address common questions and feedback, using Youtube background music to increase entertainment value, or even collaborating with customers and other industry experts.That transition might feel strange for your team, but if you\u2019re doing your SEO research (finding good keywords, going after competitive topics, and choosing the right tags) you\u2019ll position your videos to get in front of the right audience. Then it\u2019s all up to you to connect with those viewers and show them why your product is the right fit for them.A Final Word Of AdviceOne thing YouTube doesn\u2019t have is a parallel to pillar pages. You\u2019ll still want to build content clusters on a YouTube channel, of course. That\u2019s a huge benefit to make the most of the \u201cSuggestions\u201d sidebar, and also how you\u2019ll keep people coming back to your content.However, without a way to build a centralized hub, it\u2019s up to you to make sure each video targets a keyword that will help your brand outside of YouTube.YouTube itself can be a valuable resource to get your content in front of more people. But embedding those videos into existing blog posts is a way to double down on the weight of YouTube keywords. If YouTube sees the SEO value of your video content, then you know Google will recognize that when it crawls your website.Chasing views and shares on YouTube can become a hamster wheel for digital marketers. And if YouTube is a new channel for you, it\u2019s easy to put all of your eggs into that basket \u2014 after all, with 2 billion monthly users actively searching for new videos, even 0.001% of that number would be a huge win.So to really make the most of your YouTube channel, make sure you are using those skills in your video marketing strategy. It might not win you any awards, but following these four steps will help you leverage your SEO knowledge into a straightforward, tried-and-true process toward YouTube success.

        "text": "How to turn your content model into a powerful marketing and SEO weapon Providing your website with a structured content model is not only the best solution to better organize your content, but also a powerful strategy to improve the SEO of your website and increase organic traffic.In this article, we\u2019ll explain how the WordLift entity-based model, coupled with the new feature WL Mappings, will allow you to add a more specific markup to your content and to obtain a Knowledge Graph capable of communicating to search engines in a more effective way.Why is the content model becoming a key tool for SEO?During his webinar on content modeling for SEO in the WordLift Academy, Cruce Saunders highlights some of the main features that make the content model an indispensable tool for managing and enhancing online content.In fact, the content model:Specifies how information is organized on your websiteMakes content more visible to search enginesAllows you to reuse content through different channelsStructured content model, in short, not only allows you to better organize data and information but to do it within a malleable structure capable of communicating:to search engines through the use of structured datato users through the enhancement of the user experience and the possibility of reusing the content by presenting it in the form of different layouts both on the site and in the SERP to respond to specific search intents (the same article, for example, may appear in the form of a snippet, of blue link, promotion, etc.)Structuring your content model means creating a three-dimensional identity capable of highlighting your content and the relationships underlying it. This allows search engines to recognize you among hundreds of pieces of information, making you more visible to users who correspond to the search intent related to your business.The more the content model is rich in structured data, the more chances you\u2019ll have to meet exactly the users interested in you. That\u2019s why we created WordLift Mappings, a new feature that allows you to select the information and connections that are truly relevant for your business and to create an increasingly specific and refined Knowledge Graph to highlight only the most relevant facets that make your identity more authoritative.&nbsp;Through our entity-based model and WordLift Mappings, your content model becomes a powerful SEO weapon and a valuable resource to increase the value of your online data.WordLift Mappings helps you create a custom Knowledge Graph and increase your online authorityWordLift creates a personalized and highly performing Knowledge Graph through the schema.org markup and the creation of a customized entity-based vocabulary containing the most relevant data to help Google better understand your online content.Remember that Google uses entities to satisfy users' search intent and allow them to find the best results. For this reason, an increasingly refined entity-based model such as WordLift is key to increase the visibility of your content for search engines.WordLift Mappings increases the accuracy of this process and allows you to take greater care of your content and your Knowledge Graph.Advanced Custom Field for Schema.org: how the new WordLift extension worksBy connecting to ACF (Advanced Custom Field), a WordPress plugin that allows you to create advanced fields to specify the attributes that characterize your content, WordLift Mappings allows you to structure your data starting from the fields that you have already configured with ACF or from new fields based on the schema.org taxonomy.This means having more and more structured content, which can be used to add relevant details to your Knowledge Graph and shaped in different configurations to improve the user experience.In this webinar, Andrea Volpini and Jason Barnard explain how they used WordLift Mappings to improve Jason's content model and Knowledge Graph. Jason shows how he obtains a Knowledge Graph in which only the most relevant data to create an authoritarian and coherent Brand SERP are structured to stand out in the search results.With over 100 podcasts made in collaboration with some of the greatest SEO experts on the planet, Kalicube - Jason Barnard's website - has an enviable wealth of content, relevant to the entire digital marketing sector. Thanks to WordLift Mappings, we helped Jason structure this content by following a model that focuses on content, events and people. Thus, each guest of Jason's podcast has his own page connected with the podcasts in which he participated and with the events in which the podcasts were recorded.In this way, the architecture of the Knowledge Graph is customized on the basis of the content model and the \"network\" of the links between the contents becomes the bearer of meanings and allows you to predict further connections. Below you can see the entity-based content model applied to Kalicube through WordLift Mappings.What can you realistically expect in terms of traffic? How long does it take?In recent weeks, our SEO team has implemented a new content model on the site of an American customer who deals with the dismantling and re-evaluation of used hardware on a large scale.The results? After the first week, traffic increased by 14.6% and the growth curve does not seem to stop. To analyze the impact, isolating other factors that may influence the SEO of the site, we have developed a predictive model based on Bayesian networks which, analyzing the traffic in the month preceding the introduction of the WordLift Mappings, allowed us to isolate the benefit to the net of other ranking factors (it\u2019s called causal inference analysis).[et_pb_section global_module=\"12645\"][/et_pb_section] Here we see the real clicks in black and the traffic we would have had in blue (that is, the traffic predicted by the mathematical model), then in the following chart the difference between the real traffic and the estimated traffic and finally the delta of increase. In this way, we can be sure that, as analyzed, it has statistical relevance and is related to the introduction of the new content model. ?Data source: Google Search ConsoleIn summary, WordLift Mappings allows you to:Build a Custom Knowledge Graph based on your content modelImprove the SEO of your website through structured dataShape the structure of your content to improve the user experienceReuse chunks of content through different configurations to respond to different research purposesEnhance any type of content composed of reusable elements (articles, courses, events, How-Tos etc.)The implementation of a custom Knowledge Graph through WordLift Mappings has a positive and measurable impact on traffic.

        "text": "SERP Analysis with the help of AI SERP analysis is an essential step in the process of content optimization to outrank the competition on Google. In this blog post I will share a new way to run SERP analysis using machine learning and a simple python program that you can run on Google Colab.&nbsp;Jump directly to the code: Google SERP Analysis using Natural Language ProcessingSERP (Search Engine Result Page) analysis is part of keyword research and helps you understand if the query that you identified is relevant for your business goals. More importantly by analyzing how results are organized we can understand how Google is interpreting a specific query.&nbsp;What is the intention of the user making that search? What search intent Google is associating with that particular query? The investigative work required to analyze the top results provide an answer to these questions and guide us to improve (or create) the content that best fit the searcher.&nbsp;While there is an abundance of keyword research tools that provide SERP analysis functionalities, my particular interest lies in understanding the semantic data layer that Google uses to rank results and what can be inferred using natural language understanding from the corpus of results behind a query. This might also shed some light on how Google does fact extraction and verification for its own knowledge graph starting from the content we write on webpages.&nbsp;Falling down the rabbit holeIt all started when Jason Barnard and I started to chat about E-A-T and what technique marketers could use to \u201cread and visualize\u201d Brand SERPs. Jason is a brilliant&nbsp;mind and has a profound understanding of Google\u2019s algorithms, he has been studying, tracking and analyzing Brand SERPs since 2013. While Brand SERPs are a category on their own the process of interpreting search results remains the same whether you are comparing the personal brands of \u201cAndrea Volpini\u201d and \u201cJason Barnard\u201d or analyzing the different shades of meaning between \u201cmaking homemade pizza\u201d and \u201cmake pizza at home\u201d.&nbsp;Hands-on with SERP analysisIn this pytude (simple python program) as Peter Norvig would call it, the plan goes as follow:we will crawl Google\u2019s top (10-15-20) results and extract the text behind each webpage,&nbsp;we will look at the terms and the concepts of the corpus of text resulting from the&nbsp;download, parsing, and scraping of web page data (main body text) of all the results together,&nbsp;we will then compare two queries \u201cJason Barnard\u201d and \u201cAndrea Volpini\u201d in our example and we will visualize the most frequent terms for each query within the same semantic space,&nbsp;After that we&nbsp; will focus on \u201cJason Barnard\u201d in order to understand the terms that make the top 3 results unique from all the other results,&nbsp;Finally using a sequence-to-sequence model we will summarize all the top results for Jason in a featured snippet like text (this is indeed impressive),At last we will build a question-answering model on top of the corpus of text related to \u201cJason Barnard\u201d to see what facts we can extract from these pages that can extend or validate information in Google\u2019s knowledge graph.Text mining Google\u2019s SERPOur text data (Web corpus) is the result of two queries made on Google.com (you can change this parameter in the Notebook) and of the extraction of all the text behind these webpages. Depending on the website we might or might not be able to collect the text. The two queries I worked with are \u201cJason Barnard\u201d and \u201cAndrea Volpini\u201d but you can query of course whatever you like.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most crucial work, once the Web corpus has been created, in the text mining field is to present data visually. Using natural language processing (NLP) we can explore these SERPs from different angles and levels of detail. Using Scattertext&nbsp; we\u2019re immediately able to see what terms (from the combination of the two queries) differentiate the corpus from a general English corpus. What are, in other words, the most characteristic keywords of the corpus.&nbsp;The most characteristics terms in the corpus. And you can see here besides the names (volpini, jasonbarnard, cyberandy) other relevant&nbsp; terms that characterize both Jason and myself. Boowa a blue dog and Kwala a yellow koala will guide us throughout this investigation so let me first introduce them: they are two cartoon characters that Jason and his wife created back in the nineties. They are still prominent as they appear on Jason\u2019s article on a Wikipedia as part of his career as cartoon maker.Boowa and KwalaVisualizing term associations in two Brand SERPsIn&nbsp; the scatter plot below we have on the y-axis the category \"Jason Barnard\" (our first query), and on the x-axis the category for \u201cAndrea Volpini\u201d. On the top right corner of the chart we can see the most frequent terms on both SERPs - the semantic junctions between Jason and myself according to Google. Not surprisingly there you will find terms like: Google, Knowledge, Twitter and SEO. On the top left side we can spot Boowa and Kwala for Jason and on the bottom right corner AI, WordLift and knowledge graph for myself. &nbsp;To extract the entities we use spaCy and an extraordinary library Jason Kassler called Scattertext.Visualizing the terms related to \"Jason Barnard\" (y-axis) and \"Andrea Volpini\" (x-asix). The visualization is interactive and allows us to zoom on a specific term like \u201cseo\u201d. Try it.Comparing the terms that make the top 3 results unique When analyzing the SERP our goal is to understand how Google is interpreting the intent of the user and what terms Google considers relevant for that query. To do so, in the experiment, we split the corpus of the results related to Jason between the content that ranks in position 1, 2 and 3 and everything else.  On the top the terms extracted from the top 3 results and below everything else. Open the chart on a separate tab from here.Summarizing Google's Search Results When creating well-optimized content professional SEOs analyze the top results in order to analyze the search intent and to get an overview of the competition. As Gianluca Fiorelli, whom I personally admire a lot, would say; it is vital to look at it directly. https://twitter.com/gfiorelli1/status/1054632608401887232Since we now have the web corpus of all the results I decided to let the AI do the hard work in order to \"read\" all the content related to Jason and to create an easy to read summary. I've experimented quite a lot lately with both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques and I found that, when dealing with an heterogeneous multi-genre corpus like the one we get from scraping web results, BART (a sequence-to-sequence text model) does an excellent job in understanding the text and generating abstractive summaries (for English).Let's it in action on Jason's results. Here is where the fun begins. Since I was working with Jason Barnard a.k.a the Brand SERP Guy, Jason was able to update his own Brand SERP as if Google was his own CMS ?and we could immediately see from the summary how these changes where impacting what Google was indexing. Here below the transition from Jason marketer, musicians and cartoon maker to Jason full-time digital marketer.  Can we reverse-engineer Google\u2019s answer box? As Jason and I were progressing with the experiment I also decided to see how close a Question Answering System running Google , pre-trained models of BERT, could get to Google's answer box for the Jason-related question below.  Quite impressively, as the web corpus was indeed, the same that Google uses, I could get exactly the same result.  A fine-tuning task on SQuAD for the corpus of result of \"Jason Barnard\"This is interesting as it tells us that we can use question-answering systems to validate if the content that we're producing responds to the question that we're targeting.[et_pb_section global_module=\"10498\"][/et_pb_section]Lesson we learnedWe can produce semantically organized knowledge from raw unstructured content much like a modern search engine would do. By reverse engineering the semantic extraction layer using NER from Google\u2019s top results we can \u201csee\u201d the unique terms that make web documents stand out on a given query. We can also analyze the evolution over time and space (the same query in a different region can have a different set of results) of these terms. While with keyword research tools we always see a \u2018static\u2019 representation of the SERP by running our own analysis pipeline we realize that these results are constantly changing as new content surfaces the index and as Google\u2019s neural mind improves its understanding of the world and of the person making the query.By comparing different queries we can find aspects in common and uniqueness that can help us inform the content strategy (and the content model behind the strategy).&nbsp;Are you ready to run your first SERP Analysis using Natural Language Processing?Get in contact with our&nbsp;SEO management service team now!Credits All of this wouldn\u2019t happen without Jason\u2019s challenge of \u201cvisualizing\u201d E-A-T and brand serps and this work is dedicated to him and to the wonderful community of marketers, SEOs, clients and partners that are supporting WordLift.&nbsp;A big thank you also goes to the open-source technologies used in this experiment:Google Search library by Mario VilasTrafilatura by Adrien BarbaresiJason S.

        "text": "Title tag optimization using deep learning In this article, we explore how to evaluate the correspondence between title tags and the keywords that people use on Google to reach the content they need. We will share the results of the analysis (and the code behind) using a TensorFlow model for encoding sentences into embedding vectors. The result is a list of titles that can be improved on your website. Jump directly to the code: Semantic Similarity of Keywords and Titles - a SEO task using TF-Hub Universal EncoderLet\u2019s start with the basics. What is the title tag? We read on Woorank a simple and clear definition.\u201cA title tag is an HTML element that defines the title of the page. Titles are one of the most important on-page factors for SEO. [...]They are used, combined with meta descriptions, by search engines to create the search snippet displayed in search results.\u201dEvery search engine\u2019s most fundamental goal is to match the intent of the searcher by analyzing the query to find the best content on the web on that specific topic. In the quest for relevancy a good title influence search engines only partially (it takes a lot more than just matching the title with the keyword to rank on Google) but it does have an impact especially on top ranking positions (1st and 2nd according to a study conducted a few years ago by Cognitive SEO). This is also due to the fact that a searcher is likely inclined to click when they find good semantic correspondence between the keyword used on Google and the title (along with the meta description) displayed in the search snippet of the SERP.What is semantic similarity in text mining? Semantic similarity defines the distance between terms (or documents) by analyzing their semantic meanings as opposed to looking at their syntactic form. \u201cApple\u201d and \u201capple\u201d are the same word and if I compute the difference syntactically using an algorithm like Levenshtein they will look identical, on the other hand, by analyzing the context of the phrase where the word apple is used I can \u201cread\u201d the true semantic meaning and find out if the word is referencing the world-famous tech company headquartered in Cupertino or the sweet forbidden fruit of Adam and Eve.A search engine like Google uses NLP and machine learning to find the right semantic match between the intent and the content. This means the search engines are no longer looking at keywords as strings of text but they are reading the true meaning that each keyword has for the searcher. As SEO and marketers, we can also now use AI-powered tools to create the most authoritative content for a given query.There are two main ways to compute the semantic similarity using NLP:  \twe can compute the distance of two terms using semantic graphs and ontologies by looking at the distance between the nodes (this is how our tool WordLift is capable of discerning if apple - in a given sentence - is the company founded by Steve Jobs or the sweet fruit). A very trivial, but interesting example is to, build a \u201csemantic tree\u201d (or better we should say a directed graph) by using the Wikidata P279-property (subclass of).You can run the query on Wikidata and generate a P279 graph for \u201capple\u201d (the fruit) http://tinyurl.com/y39pqk5p \twe can alternatively use a statistical approach and train a deep neural network to build - from a text corpus (a collection of documents), a vector space model that will help us transform the terms in numbers to analyze their semantic similarity and run other NLP tasks (i.e. classification).There is a&nbsp;crucial and essential debate behind these two approaches. The essential question&nbsp;being: is there a path by which our machines can possess any true understanding?&nbsp;Our best AI efforts after all only create an illusion of an understanding. Both rule-based ontologies and statistical models are far from producing a real thought as it is known in cognitive studies of the human brain. I am not going to expand here but, if you are in the mood, read this blog post on the Noam Chomsky / Peter Norvig debate.&nbsp; &nbsp;Text embeddings in SEO\t\t\t\t\tWord embeddings (or text embeddings) are a type of algebraic representation of words that allows words with similar meaning to have similar mathematical representation. A vector is an array of numbers of a particular dimension. We calculate how close or distant two words are by measuring the distance between these vectors.In this article, we\u2019re going to extract embedding using the tf.Hub Universal Sentence Encoder, a pre-trained deep neural network designed to convert text into high dimensional vectors for natural language tasks. We want to analyze the semantic similarity between hundreds of combinations of Titles and Keywords from one of the clients of our SEO management services. We are going to focus our attention on only one keyword per URL, the keyword with the highest ranking (of course we can also analyze multiple combinations). While a page might attract traffic on hundreds of keywords we typically expect to see most of the traffic coming from the keyword with the highest position on Google.We are going to start from the original code developed by the TensorFlow Hub team and we are going to use Google Colab (a free cloud service with GPU supports to work with machine learning). You can copy the code I worked on and run it on your own instance.Our starting point is a CSV file containing Keyword, Position (the actual ranking on Google) and Title. You can generate this CSV from the GSC or use any keyword tracking tool like Woorank, MOZ or Semrush. You will need to upload the file to the session storage of Colab (there is an option you can click in the left tray) and you will need to update the file name on the line that starts with:df = pd.read_csv( \u2026 )Here is the output. Let\u2019s get into action. The pre-trained model comes with two flavors: one trained with a Transformer encoder and another trained with a Deep Averaging Network (DAN). The first one is more accurate but has higher computational resource requirements. I used the transformer considering the fact that I only worked with a few hundreds of combinations. In the code below we initiate the module, open the session (it takes some time so the same session will be used for all the extractions), get the embeddings, compute the semantic distance and store the results. I did some tests in which I removed the site name, this helped me see things differently but in the end, I preferred to keep whatever a search engine would see.The semantic similarity - &nbsp;the degree to which the title and the keyword carry the same meaning - is calculated, as the inner products of the two vectors. An interesting aspect of using word embeddings from this model is that - for English content - I can easily calculate the semantic similarity of both short and long text. This is particularly helpful when looking at a dataset that might contain very short keywords and very long titles. The result is a table of combinations from rankings between 1 and 5 that have the least semantic similarity (Corr). &nbsp;It is interesting to see that it can help, for this specific website, to add to the title the location (i.e. Costa Rica, Anguilla, Barbados, \u2026). With a well-structured data markup we are already helping the search engine disambiguate these terms by specifying the geographical location, but for the user making the search, it might be beneficial to see at a glance the name of the location he/she is searching for in the search snippet. We can achieve this by revising the title or by bringing more structure in the search snippets using schema:breadcrumbs to present the hierarchy of the places (i.e. Italy &gt; Lake Como &gt; \u2026).In this scatter plot we can also see that the highest semantic similarity between titles and keywords has an impact on high rankings for this specific website.Semantic Similarity between keywords and titles visualizedStart running your semantic content auditCrawling your website using natural language processing and machine learning to extract and analyze the main entities, greatly helps you improve the findability of your content. Adding semantic rich structured data in your web pages helps search engines match your content with the right audience. Thanks to&nbsp;NLP and deep learning I could see that to reduce the gap&nbsp;- between what people search and the existing titles - it was important - for this website - to add the Breadcrumbs markup with the geographical location of the villas. Once again AI, while still incapable of true understanding, helps us become&nbsp;more relevant for our audience (and it does it at web scele on hundreds of web pages).Solutions like the TF-Hub Universal Encoder bring, in the hands of SEO professionals and marketers, the same AI-machinery that modern search engines like Google use to compute the relevancy of content. Unfortunately, this specific&nbsp;model is limited to English only.Are you ready to run your first semantic content audit? Get in contact with our&nbsp;SEO management service team now!",

        "text": "How to Create Smart Content to Improve Your Marketing Strategy Only 28% of B2C marketers say their approach to content marketing is extremely or very successful. And only 33% have a documented content strategy.That\u2019s just not good enough.Content is the backbone of any good marketing strategy. Yet, the majority of marketers\u2019 attempts are not as effective as they could be.If this is the case for you, you\u2019re probably wondering: where am I going wrong?The truth is, you need an intelligent strategy to increase content performance.Here\u2019s how to improve your content marketing strategy.1. Utilize AnalyticsWhat\u2019s the smartest way to create content? Use the data you have on-hand to inform the type of content you produce.According to SEMRush\u2019s Practical Guide to Data-Driven Content Marketing:At this point, we can state with confidence that high-quality content relies on precise analytics and trustworthy data. When content is not supported by data, you can never be sure that it will directly hit the audience\u2019s pain points and contribute to your objectives.Essentially, you can guarantee that your content will serve your audience and your brand goals, by using the data you gather from analytics.Use your data to create variations on your top-performing content.In Google Analytics, head to Behavior &gt; Site Content &gt; All Pages.Here you will find a number of metrics, such as pageviews, dwell time and bounce rate:Through looking at this data, you can answer some key questions about your content.What are the most popular content frameworks e.g. ultimate guides, infographics, case studies, etc.?And which topics do my readers enjoy most?You can filter the results according to your objectives.Let\u2019s say, you want to keep people on your site for longer - then you would look at the posts with the highest average time on page:Use this treasure trove of information to create variations of your most popular content.For example, if your audience digs infographics then you should start creating infographics at regular intervals.Or if a particular topic performs well, let\u2019s say, \u201cdecorating on a budget\u201d, then try similar topics, e.g. \u201cDIY decorating\u201d or \u201cdecorating kitchens on a budget\u201d and so on.The point is, use your existing content to create new content that\u2019s guaranteed to perform well every single time.2. Refresh and Repurpose ContentNot all content ages well, like a fine wine or a George Clooney.You need to refresh and recycle outdated content regularly.Otherwise, all of the blood, sweat, and tears that went into its creation goes to waste as content becomes stagnant and useless.The cool thing is that repurposing content is a strategy that really works.One brand got 50% more clicks when they recycled a blog post into an infographic the following year.Your first job is to update and improve existing content. An easy way to find content in need of a refresh is to use Analytics.On the same page as above, sort your results by unique visitors.Find pages that have a high number of unique visitors but also a high bounce rate:This indicates that this content is no longer relevant and you should update it. We, at Sleeknote, know this better than anyone.When we relaunched our blog post on Facebook lead ads, we increased our organic traffic by 290.67% in 3 weeks.You can also repurpose content by converting it into other formats.Follow speaker, Brian Fanzo\u2019s example:[I] record my podcast on Facebook Live, upload audio to iTunes, create a blog post, take 4 best quotes from the episode and create graphics for Pinterest, take 4 clips from a month\u2019s worth of episodes and create a 2-minute video to use as a Twitter video.The moral of the story is: Get the most out of your content, even if it\u2019s gone stagnant.3. Produce Linkable AssetsYou\u2019re always going to have to make earning links a major part of your marketing strategy. Why?Some SEOs believe links are the #1 ranking factor.So, if you haven\u2019t been focusing on acquiring links, now\u2019s the time.The best way to earn links is to create epic, in-depth pieces of content worthy of links, i.e. linkable assets.Say buh-bye to shady techniques.Here are a few examples of strong linkable assets:InfographicsOthers use and link to them because they\u2019re simply interesting or they add value to their posts i.e. they explain a complex topic visually and succinctly.Here\u2019s a nice example from CarRentals.com:Original or Compiled ResearchPeople link to such as a key source or reference point for their arguments.Or, of course, as a matter of interest.See this example from MyFitnessPal:Long-Form GuidesThese are incredibly useful and thorough.They\u2019re linkable because people would rather link to one strong source than several inferior ones.Take a look at this guide from The Beard Club:At the end of the day, short, simplistic blog posts aren\u2019t going to cut it when it comes to bagging links.You have to create strong assets that you can shop around.4. Show Off Your E-A-TIf you want your content to perform well, you can\u2019t be a basic\u2026 so-and-so any longer.Since Google\u2019s August 2018 broad core algorithm update, your content has to display your E-A-T (Expertise, Authority, and Trustworthiness).This is particularly important if you\u2019re selling something or are in a health and lifestyle niche, i.e. Your Money or Your Life websites.There are several ways you can increase E-A-T.First, make sure all content is well-researched, using credible facts, sources, and data throughout.This is a good example from GreenLine:Furthermore, you can work with experts or influencers to create content.In the following example, Etsy\u2019s tips come from a legit health and wellness coach.In other words, they\u2019re not just randomly made-up by some copywriter.The point here is, if you make everything you write credible and verifiable, your content will rank better.Key TakeawaysYou need to use smart techniques to create content that contributes to your overall marketing strategy.Firstly, utilize data to find topics and formats that work well for you and do more of the same.Refresh and repurpose content regularly to get the most value from your content.Create content that\u2019s actually worthy of links.And finally, infuse blog posts with E-A-T to up its performance in the SERPs.Now it\u2019s over to you.Take the first step and open up Analytics to find your top-performing content.[et_pb_section global_module=\"12524\"][/et_pb_section]Featured Image CreditsImage by Diggity Marketing from Pixabay.",

        "text": "Optimizing For Voice Search - Here's How Important It Has Become Voice search has always been considered to be a luxury but it has now become more of a necessity as more people are searching the internet via voice commands. Who would want to sit and type out information when you can simply voice this information and voila? ?We\u2019ve come a long way in this regard, from virtual assistants with the likes of Siri and Alexa carrying out mundane tasks including weather reports, trending news and scheduling appointments to real-time traffic evaluation and providing accurate pin-point GPS locations. All of this information is communicated without the need to ever press a button or input a command, at least not a written one.In the digital market, this feature has untapped potential when it comes to closely associating to exact-keyword matches for the spoken query. The benefits involved apply to both the interested parties. Let\u2019s delve a bit deeper into the rising significance of voice searches.How important is voice search?When looking at user convenience, it is important to note that thanks to the integration of voice recognition software in multiple platforms, individuals go through versatile experiences via many different channels.The accessibility and ease of simply voicing your concerns or questions is unprecedented in describing any problem. For example, would you prefer speaking to a doctor when explaining your condition or would you write it down? The answer is quite simple as it is in our nature to seek convenience wherever we possibly can.Not to mention, the solution to the query obtained is much quicker as well, naturally reducing bounce rates and retaining the potential consumer for longer. This way, the user is satisfied with his answer as it matches closely with the words he uttered, which in turn, is favourable for the business to improve customer relations and feedback.Here are some statistics to further emphasize on the importance of voice search: \t58% of consumers employed the use of voice search for finding contact details among other info for local businesses within the last year. \tIn the US, 71% of individuals lying in 18-29 age group use mobile virtual assistants. \tUsing smart home speakers, around 22% of consumers purchased a product. \tThe future holds an even more promising prospect for voice searches when the concept is applied to marketing strategies: \t20% of all search queries online are voice-based. By 2020, that figure is predicted to change to 50% which will make voice search technically as relevant as typed searches. \tVoice-based smart speaker market globally is forecasted to reach $30 billion in revenue by 2024. \tVoice-enabled shopping is expected to rise to $40 billion in revenue generated by 2022.Google Assistant, a service that accompanies Google Home speakers, is currently the most popular voice-based software that supports 17 languages as of now, with plans to reach 30 sometime this year. This allows user to voice their commands in English, French, German, Dutch, Spanish, Korean and Mandarin among others. Furthermore, it even accounts for differences in accent and phonology of English in different parts of the world including the UK, US, Singapore and India.When looking at the e-commerce sector, Amazon\u2019s Alexa is the clear winner with 71% of the market share in the US for its Echo speakers compared to Google Home\u2019s 24%. It is safe to say the market is still very unsaturated for smart speakers and voice-based queries with only 39 apps of now supporting such tech. To become a part of the rising trend and embracing the future of e-commerce, let\u2019s take a look at some of the practices or strategies you can employ for optimizing your platform for voice search.How to optimize your content for voice search?By now, you realize the importance and need for tailoring your on-site content such that it shows up higher in organic search results when triggered via a voice search.KeywordsKeyword research has always been important in all forms of marketing and advertising; it is no different when it comes to voice search or commands. However, you need to account for the differences as individuals are likely to be more natural (as opposed to be more direct and specific with typed searches) in their queries so long-tail keywords and more conversational words are suited for a more semantic search.Additionally, phrases should also be at the forefront of the strategy that you will be employing to target certain keywords for voice search. Google Analytics and the \u2018People Also Ask\u2019 section of the search results are good indicative tools for tailoring your keywords to voice-based queries with the latter providing similar recommendations for any given query.Furthermore, thanks to a greater share of voice searches belonging to local information and details, your digital platform can favour by incorporating words like \u2018near me\u2019 and \u2018close to my location\u2019 in the meta description and alt texts and tags of your content.This provides a quick answer to the person\u2019s query for nearby restaurants, educational institutes or petrol stations where your website becomes immediately visible.Tone and writingTo relate to the user better, you need to speak their language. Often at times, you won\u2019t find an individual speaking out his query in a strict professional tone. Rather, a colloquial and informal approach is usually always favoured and so your content should match this tone accordingly as well.While altering and tailoring the writing style to the user\u2019s likeness, it is important not to detract from the main goal which is communicating relevant info. The solution should be satisfactory and you should be concise about it.Q&amp;A for featured snippetsFAQ pages and featured snippets, or the famous \u20180th place\u2019 on the search results go hand-in-hand as Google values direct answers which match closely with the user\u2019s query. Featured snippets are a great way to increase in-bound traffic and brand awareness.The basics are relevant here with many people asking \u2018what\u2019, \u2018why\u2019 and \u2018how\u2019 about a particular product, service or person. Most of the snippets are related to sectors like health or medical information, commerce statistics and how-to descriptions or recipes for cooking.Remember, above anything else, short and to-the-point precise answers will always be the key to solving the user\u2019s problem in the shortest amount of time so modify your content accordingly.Structured dataAlternatively known as schema markups or rich snippets, these appear below the URL of your website and give a hint to the user about the additional information within the website that they can redirect to then and there.These details can range from pricing options to contact info, or even the different sections or hierarchy of the web. Such data is also of great use to the search engines as web crawlers or bots find it easier to \u2018understand\u2019 your website by making it clear to them the metadata or sitemap so the relevancy of the content can be figured.Services like Schema.org, SchemaApp and Google\u2019s own Structured Data Markup Helper will allow you not only to boost SEO rankings by 30% but respond better to voice-based searches especially with Schema.org\u2019s Speakable property.Mobile and speed optimizationLastly, we need to consider where the actual voice searches are coming from, and how to excel at that particular channel for better results. The answer already being crystal-clear, there\u2019s no getting to the voice-search heaven without passing the SEO river first and that\u2019s why mobile optimization is absolutely necessary.The most important aspect of boasting an effective mobile version of any site is to make sure your pages load in no longer than 2 seconds. Remember, users are expecting almost instant answers when they use vocal queries and a sluggish site works to the opposite effect, thereby frustrating the user away.Google\u2019s Lighthouse tool is great in this regard as it has runs a thorough edit of the desktop or mobile version of the site and then provides a comprehensive report including all the concerns to be addressed and potential solutions or recommendations to improve upon them.ConclusionVoice-enabled searches are here to stay and increase exponentially as we delve into the ever-expanding capabilities of technology. Quick and relevant responses, in addition to versatile and accessible options only speak in favour of such a feature. To capitalize on it, businesses can employ strategies that unsurprisingly aren\u2019t different to those implemented for favouring SEO rankings.The same guidelines apply which sees platforms vying for optimizing mobile versions of their site, playing closely to the keyword(s) inputted by the user, Q&amp;As for increased relevance and where voice-search and SEO have no correlation, having an informal tone to better match the expectations of the average customer.About the AuthorSohail Rupani is a senior SEO Strategist at an Orlando Digital Marketing Company.

        "text": "How To Build A High-Converting Video Website That Ranks Effectively ranking a video-on-demand website in search engines is a challenge many content creators and businesses face.And with the ongoing global pandemic and current landscape, many have started looking into taking their businesses, events, and organization online by launching a video-on-demand site to host/monetize their content and have it globally accessible.When the majority of your content is video-based and hidden behind a paywall, it can make on-page SEO feel like a constant uphill battle. But it doesn\u2019t need to be.&nbsp;By learning how to build your video website the correct way, you can create a platform that ranks well for your target keywords and also outranks YouTube, like this one.In this guide, I\u2019m going to show you how our best Uscreen clients have optimized their video websites to rank high on SERPs and convert.How To Build A High-Ranking Video Website In 7 Steps Step 1: Perform A \u201cNetflix Audit\u201dThe first step is to perform what I call a \u201cNetflix Audit.\u201dThis involves going through your website and stripping it of any elements that make the logged-out view of your website look like Netflix\u2019s logged-in dashboard. That\u2019s this page here:Video websites often try to emulate Netflix\u2019s design because it looks aesthetically brilliant, showcases the depth of their video database, and has a familiar feel to their target customers. As you can see from the design below on Magic Stream\u2019s website, it looks and feels just like Netflix:  But this type of theme design on your website\u2019s customer-facing website pages comes at a high cost to both SEO and conversions, because it:Decreases your website\u2019s speedLimits the amount of text (and keywords) which feature on a pageDoesn\u2019t provide enough context for semantic searchDoesn\u2019t contain elements needed to convert a customer (like CTAs or product info)Combined, these elements can have a negative impact on your website\u2019s rankings. If nothing else, the layout is complex for Google\u2019s crawlers to work their way through, and filled with information they struggle to interpret.Netflix understands the pitfalls of using this dashboard view and, despite not having a search-led marketing campaign, they still opt for a text-based homepage.If your video website is heavily reliant on this Netflix-style theme, I highly recommend you keep this dashboard-view for the paid (read: logged-in) version of your website and use a more traditional-style landing page for your homepage and subsequent category and taxonomy landing pages.Step 2: Optimise Your Website\u2019s HomepageThe most important page of any video on demand website is the homepage. It has two crucial jobs:Ranking: it needs to be well structured to compete for good positions in the SERPsConverting: it needs to convince visitors to become customersYour homepage is one of the few pages that will be eligible to rank for search terms because it isn\u2019t behind a paywall, so it\u2019s your chance to shine in the SERPs. It\u2019s also one of the few pages visitors will see before making a purchasing decision.These factors mean the page will need to be optimized enough to rank for your target keywords but also structured in a way that showcases your product. Basically, it needs to be both a landing page and a sales page rolled into one.&nbsp;To help you achieve this, let\u2019s split this step into mini-sections.Ranking: How To Optimise Your Video Homepage For Search EnginesTo create a well-optimized homepage, you will want to rank for two kinds of keywords:Branded: the keywords you \u201cown\u201d (such as your company or product name)&nbsp;Most relevant: a short or medium-tail keyword likely to drive relevant trafficIf you\u2019re already fleshing out your SEO strategy, you will already have these keywords in place. Use this guide to understand how keyword research works and how to get started.To ensure you have space to naturally include these keywords on your page, follow the 80/20 rule:80% of your homepage should be made up of keyword optimizable elements (headers, text, images, etc.)20% of your homepage should be made up of videoIn a recent study, we\u2019ve found that your homepage\u2019s length doesn\u2019t play too much of a role in how you rank\u2014our top four ranking Uscreen video websites have less than 500 words on their homepage\u2014but making use of this 80/20 balance does.Be sure to feature your target keywords inAt least one H1 or H2 tagThe Alt tags for at least one imageYour title tags and meta descriptionIndieFilmHustle TV, a video website focused on indie filmmakers and screenwriters, is a great example of getting this right with limited text.Their target keyword is \u201cIndie Film Channel\u201d which they strategically placed in key places for semantic search, namely the page\u2019s header, and title tags: Doing this has enabled them to have enough information and context for Google to willingly rank them in the second position for their target keyword.Converting: How To Structure Your Video Homepage For Sales (A 10-Point System)We find high-converting video homepages all follow a similar structure from the top of their page to the bottom.&nbsp;This can be varied depending on your branding and what you feel looks best for your site, but these elements should be present in some way. Here are the 10 points they all hit:Hero image or carousel: vivid and relevant product or niche imagerySubscription info: two-to-three sentences about your product and any free trialsExpanded product info: text-based information about your product or page (which can be supported by video or text)Free trial link: 52% of people who sign up for a free trial convert into paying customers\u201cHow It Works\u201d section: a bullet-point list of how video on demand works (as it relates to your product)Testimonials: share the views of your fans and customersPayment and pricing: the cost of your product with a sign-up buttonFeatured videos: a small catalog section with JPEG images internally linked to video pagesSocial media: updates from your latest social media posts (if applicable)&nbsp;Free trial link: a final mention of your product\u2019s free trialA great example of this structure is the video on demand website, Naturally Sassy:&nbsp;If you work your way down the page, the comprehensive home page allows the videos and services as the focus, without compromising on any on-page SEO factors.Step 03: Make Use Of Strategic Target KeywordsWhen Google has a limited amount of information to work with, context is everything.&nbsp;The more information you can provide in fewer words, the more it will help you set the foundation for a highly rankable website. One way you can provide more context is by using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) keywords.LSI keywords are related to your target keyword or the focus of your website and help Google understand the big picture of what your website is about. And even though Latent Semantic Indexing is old technology, and search engines might not heavily rely on LSI these days, it\u2019s still one of the best SEO practices to make sure that your storefront and other pages are targeting a set of keywords and key phrases relevant to what you represent and what searchers are actively looking for when searching for your content.Let\u2019s say you run a pop-culture website and you create a video web page talking about \u201cAvatar.\u201d Google would look for these set of keywords to determine if you are referencing:Avatar - The 2009 Film (Film, James Cameron, CGI, etc.)Avatar - The Metal Band (Music, Guitar Solo, Tour Dates, etc.)Avatar - The Anime Cartoon (Aang, Nickelodeon, Waterbending, etc)These keywords are especially important if your target keyword could be interpreted in multiple ways. Take KweliTV, an independent film streaming platform, for example, whose target keyword is \u201cblack streaming service.\u201d The word \u201cblack\u201d makes this keyword unspecific; it could be referring to a brand called Black or an illegal black-market streaming service.&nbsp;To ensure their website is recognized as a streaming service for black people, KweliTV uses a range of LSI keywords like:Black community100% black-ownedAfrican descent:- Caribbean,&nbsp;- African American- Latin American- EuropeanDiversityCultural issues.These keywords will often naturally appear in your website\u2019s copywriting. But, you can also find them suggested using a tool like WooRank\u2019s keyword tool.Step 04: Hit The \u201cBig Three\u201d Of Video OptimisationThis part is simple. Google is looking for three things when analyzing a video:Title: a descriptive headline for the video&nbsp;Description: a clear description of what the video is aboutThumbnail: an image relevant to the contentThese enable Google to determine what your video is about if it\u2019s unique and valuable, and whether it\u2019s worth ranking and are non-negotiables in the eyes of Google\u2019s webmaster guidelines.Because Google doesn\u2019t \u201cwatch\u201d your video in the same way it \u201creads\u201d a blog post or article, this extra information provides more context and an understanding of how the video will look to the viewer.Step 05: Build Video Optimised Pages To Attract TrafficAs a video content creator, you are likely to use video to help promote your business. One way to capitalize on this, and to generate more organic search traffic, is to focus on ranking video pages and category pages.These pages are a great way to add high-value content to your video on demand site, which is also likely to attract links and social signals that can improve your rankings.The structure of these pages is similar to that of a blog post, which as standard will include:Keywords in your headline tagsLSI keywords throughout the pageAn optimized meta-descriptionMinimum 300 words textInternal links to other website pagesMoz does this brilliantly with their Weekly Whiteboard Friday video posts, like this one on SEO title hacks:They use a short, keyword-rich introduction to the video, and then follow it up with a blog-post style transcription of the video below.Video content is well and truly at the core of this content, but these extra touches help to increase the perceived value of the content and have some positive semantic search factors.Step 06: Use Schema Markup To Add Depth&nbsp;Google has a hard time understanding video content. They can glean limited information from the audio and video files but are still heavily reliant on text and users to provide context.You can make Google\u2019s job much easier by applying schema markup to each of your video and category pages. This allows you to tag elements of your video like:The video\u2019s contentWho made and directed itReviews or ratings of the videoAnd more data types.Adding schema markups to your video and category pages will enable Google to display your pages as rich results. Here you can find the ultimate checklist to rank in the Google Top Stories Carousel. Source: IMPACT Although schema markups don't directly impact rankings, it can help Google understand the information on your pages better. This is super helpful for your video pages and category pages.You can read the full guide to video schema markup right here.FAQ Schema for Video and Category PagesAnother great tactic to increase your SERP real estate and drive more clicks is to use FAQ schema markups on your video and category pages.What is FAQ schema?\u201cA Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) page contains a list of questions and answers pertaining to a particular topic. Properly marked up FAQ pages may be eligible to have a rich result on Search and an Action on the Google Assistant, which can help your site reach the right users.\u201d -GoogleHere's an example of an FAQ rich result:Although Google only mentions FAQ schemas for FAQ pages, this doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t leverage this type of schema on other pages.In fact, adding a FAQ section to your category and video pages, not only will allow you to naturally add context to the pages but also will allow you to answer frequently asked questions, boost your visibility on SERPs and organic traffic.For example, let\u2019s say you\u2019ve launched an online yoga studio and published a series of yoga workout videos for back pain. By answering several frequently asked questions around the topic (Yoga poses for back pain), and adding FAQ markup to your category page, you can both elevate the user-experience as well as organic traffic.&nbsp;In the example below, you can see how this page is using FAQ markup to do exactly that: Check out this guide to learn more about how you can easily add FAQ markups to your pages using GTM, regardless of your CMS.Step 07: Make Use Of YouTubeYouTube is the world\u2019s largest video search engine and it should play a part in your website\u2019s overall SEO strategy.As you can see in this example from TawzerDog, it\u2019s possible to rank first for keywords on both search engines, without negatively impacting your search results: Uploading your marketing videos to YouTube can provide social signals back to your website, as well as bringing in traffic from people who find you on their platform.&nbsp;Wrapping This Up\u2026Although ranking a video and live streaming website is more challenging than your usual text-based website, I hope you can see it\u2019s not impossible.&nbsp;By setting the foundation of good on-page SEO, and focusing on user-experience over video-showcasing, you can build a website framework that ranks well, even with limited content.[et_pb_section global_module=\"12463\"][/et_pb_section]",

        "text": "Cameos on Google in a Nutshell What is Cameos on Google?Google Cameos is a new - invite-only&nbsp;- Google Search experiment to let people (that already appear in Google Knowledge Graph) record videos for answering simple questions related to their work and/or life experience.Video-answers appear in Google Search right below the knowledge panel; the same answers are also presented on Google Discover and can pop up on the&nbsp;Google Assistant when a user asks something about that person.Cameos&nbsp;on&nbsp;Google&nbsp;lets you be the authority on you. This is how Google explains it.Here is how Google Cameos workQuite simply, here is how it worked for me: \tI received an invitation by email \tI downloaded the Google Cameos APP on my phone (you can find it for both Android and iOS) \tUpon starting the app (and here is where the fun begins), it will start generating questions by looking at the information Google has in its Knowledge Graph; these questions are divided into two categories:- For the fans&nbsp;(things that are more closely related to the information Google has about you)- Trending topics (most frequent questions on topics that relates to you) \tSimply by choosing a question you can start recording and, if you like the preview, you can send the video and \tThe video gets published in an hour or so on Google Search below the knowledge panel \tYou get from the app a quick overview in terms of \"Total Impressions\" and \"Watches\"Cameos on GoogleWhat do you need to use Google Cameos?Right now the experiment is limited and you will need to get an invite to partecipate but, here is what I did before getting the invitation. \tGet your name/entity in Google's Knowledge Graph (not trivial but these days not so difficult either) \tGet your entity verified - if your name appears with a Knowledge panel you can get started with the verification process from there - alternatively you can you start from Posts on Google \tMake sure the content about you is always fresh and up to date (you can suggest edits on the information available on the Knowledge Panel)From Cameos to Google DiscoverIs Google trying again to become a Social Network?Well, yes in a way the medium is similar, the user is entice to invest on his own personal branding and to engage with his/her audience on Google's channels. While we only see it happening for people in the Knowledge Graphit is easy to expect that anyone is already in Google's Knowledge Graph one way or another. Try to ask Google to call a friend from Twitter and you will find yourself in the awkward position of accessing a phone number of a person that, yes you know, but who is not in your phone's contact list, and all of this displayed with a nice-looking material card containing a photo of that person taken from...well, the web.The 3 things I learnt from the Google Cameos experiment \tThe SERP is getting richer and richer to let people interact with each others in all sort of ways; \tGoogle's interactions and activation channels are built on top of its ever-growing knowledge graph; the more data you provide the easier it gets for Google to let you connect with your audience - this is valid for a small business, an individual and a brand. In this particular case the most exciting piece of technology is the machinery used to generate the questions by looking at the data in the Knowledge Graph. Let me give you an example, since Google knows that I have co-founded several companies and I am currently holding a CEO position - my questions are all gravitating about being a CEO, starting up a company and acting as a founder. Generating novel questions from Knowledge Graph is one of these tech challenges the ML/DL community is very excited about; as a marketer this means that the more I expand the&nbsp;data related to my entities the more occasions I get of interacting with my audience; \tGoogle's heavily investing on its own Walled Garden by providing an AI-driven communication platform where everyone can also buy ads - it's interesting to see as these experiments on the \"organic\" front tend to have their own \"paid\" counterpart (think for instance of the lead generation that has been recently introduced on Google Ads) - this means that a lot is changing in the way that&nbsp;organic search work and the stronger your brand is the more chances you have in capturing users attention.Now, it's really time to get famous and start playing with Cameos ?",

        "text": "WordLift Next Generation receives grant from EU to Bring AI-Powered SEO to Any Website WordLift, Redlink GmbH, SalzburgerLand Tourismus GmbH and the Department of Computer Science of the University of Innsbruck teamed up under the WordLift Next Generation project to develop a new platform to deliver Agentive SEO technology to any website. The work started in February and will last for 36 months.We are pleased to announce that together with our partners Redlink GmbH, SalzburgerLand Tourismus GmbH and the Semantic Technology Institute at the University of Innsbruck, Austria, we have received funding support from EU&nbsp; to develop a new technology that will be available for any Content Management System.&nbsp;The project, called WordLift Next Generation, will be developed with the financial support received from Eurostars H2020, a program promoted by the European Union that supports research activities and innovative SMEs. WordLift NG is part of a financing plan allocated by the EU to make European companies more competitive through AI tools at the service of businesses and people.As our CEO Andrea Volpini stated recently, \u201cArtificial Intelligence is shaping the online world with huge investments from GAFAM&nbsp; (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon e Microsoft). Our company successfully brought these technologies to mid/small size content owners, SMEs and news publishers worldwide using WordPress. It\u2019s time to expand outside of the WordPress ecosystem while adding new services such as semantic search, improved content recommendations and conversational UIs for the Google Assistant and Alexa to help this market segment remain competitive.\u201dWordLift automates and streamlines the technical processes required to make a website discoverable through search engines and personal digital assistant; we have been first to market a Knowledge Graph optimized for SEO, combining semantic annotations with information publicly available as linked open data.&nbsp;With WordLift NG, the consortium plans to improve the way in which our software understands web articles and builds knowledge bases, employing semantic technology. With a more powerful knowledge graph, it will be possible to fully decouple WordLift from WordPress to make this technology available to any website worldwide. The consortium also aims to improve the quality of the content recommendations and to bring an engaging semantic search experience. Last but not least, as the knowledge base behind each website will improve, it will be possible to enable conversational experiences over Google Assistant and Alexa (focus will be on news and media and hospitality sector).&nbsp;To achieve these ambitious goals, we have teamed with leading organizations in Europe in the field of AI, NLP and Semantic Technologies and tourismus: Redlink GmbH (led by Andreas Gruber CEO of the company), the Semantic Technology Institute at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Innsbruck (under the supervision of Ass.-Prof. Dr. Anna Fensel) and, SalzburgerLand Tourismus GmbH (with Martin Reichhart, Innovation Manager as coordinator).&nbsp;Thanks to the EU funded project and the collaboration between Italy and Austria, WordLift NG will democratize the usage of agentive SEO, developing a complete new technology stack to help businesses around the world remain competitive in the ever-changing search and digital marketing landscape. The project has officially started on February 1, 2020, and will be completed in 36 months.&nbsp;",

        "text": "Mixing JSON-LD and Microdata: All You Need to Know In several cases you might need to mix structured data using different formats like microdata and json-ld; in this article we review the do's and don'ts for these edge cases.Can I mix microdata and json-ld?Yes,&nbsp;it is totally fine to use both syntaxes side by side on the same page but Google will not be able to&nbsp;merge attributes for the same entity using the item ID unless you are using json-ld ONLY. Let's get into the details:&nbsp; \tI can have on the same page both&nbsp;syntaxes (microdata and json-ld); for instance I might use microdata to render WebPage and use json-ld for Organization; \tI can also merge attributes related to the same entity when all the data is available in json-ld but ... \tI cannot combine information related to the same entity by item ID when this information is written in microdata and json-ld. While this is possible in principle, and a pure RDF application would be able to do it,&nbsp;Google&nbsp;does not&nbsp;support it, which means properties won't be merged and, most importantly, this won't satisfy the Rich Snippets' requirements.This topic is particularly relevant as microdata remains today the most widely used format for structured data (see data below collected by Aaron Bradley from the 2019 Common Crawl's sample) and there is a huge demand to improve structured data to gain additional visibility on Google's SERP.My aggregated tracking chart, updated (not apples-to-apples crawl-over-crawl as Common Crawl's sample set changes crawl-over-crawl) https://t.co/W3gzgfLmZ7 pic.twitter.com/0sZu4FRA3c\u2014 Aaron Bradley (@aaranged) January 14, 2020To confirm that we cannot mix attributes by item ID when combining microdata and json-ld we asked the help of several&nbsp;SEOs with in-depth knowledge on structured linked data, including&nbsp;Dan Brickley,&nbsp;Jarno van Driel,&nbsp;Jono Alderson, Richard Wallis and Mark and Martha van Berkel.Before engaging with the community we created two examples HTML pages: \tjson-ld + microdata: here is the result validated with the Google Structured Data Testing Tool (where you will see the \"Unspecified Type\" error since GSDTT cannot merge the two syntaxes); \tjson-ld + json-ld: here we can see that&nbsp;GSDTT supports the merge by type ID when data is written in json-ldInteresting enough the first example would be properly rendered by the Structured Data Linter: a tool designed to help webmaster validate structured data markup. Here follows the information from the Twitter thread and the messages by Dan Brickley and Jarno van Driel:in general you can use both syntaxes side by side, but you won't get the fine-grained merging of triples by ID that a pure RDF application might expect\u2014 Dan Brickley (@danbri) January 14, 2020I think @danbri already was pretty clear. Highly doubt you'll get a different answer from other Googlers.\u2014 Jarno van Driel (@JarnoVanDriel) January 14, 2020READY TO AUTOMATE YOUR STRUCTURED DATA MARKUP?Book a call&nbsp;with us&nbsp;and join our list of happy customers!",

        "text": "Top trends for SEO in 2018 As we approach the end of 2017, it\u2019s time to prepare your digital marketing team for the year ahead and look at the emerging trends that will rule the search world in 2018.\r\rThis is a summary I\u2019ve created with bullet-proof strategies and tested practices that I\u2019ve gathered from the gurus of the SEO industry after attending as a speaker at SMXL Milan 2017. If you, like me, want to make a real difference in 2018 with SEO, this blog post is for you.\rWhat are the top trends for SEO in 2018?\rThere are a number of aspects in the world of content findability that we have successfully tested in 2017 and that will become even more prominent in 2018. Let\u2019s have a close look at\u00a0 the top 5:\r\r1. Structured Data and Semantics\r2. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\r3. Mobile-first index, Accelerated Mobile Pages and Progressive Web Apps\r4. Search is Everywhere\r5. Voice search, chatbots and personal assistant search optimization\r\r1. Structured Data and Semantics\rThis November at PubCom Gary Illyes from Google confirmed that semantic markup is used, way beyond the search snippets, to better index your website and to rank content in Google\u2019s search result pages.\r\u201cadd structure data to your pages because during indexing, we will be able to better understand what your site is about.\u201d\rMore interestingly Gary suggested to go beyond the markup recommended by Google on their developers guides for semantic markup.\r\u201cand don\u2019t just think about the structured data that we documented on developers.google.com. Think about any schema.org schema that you could use on your pages. It will help us understand your pages better, and indirectly, it leads to better ranks in some sense, because we can rank easier.\u201d\rhttps://twitter.com/cyberandy/status/930809369922621440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\r\rHere is all you need to know about schema.org markup and how to use it to organically grow the traffic on your website. The talks from Richard Wallis, Martha van Berkel and\u2026 myself ?\u00a0 are a great starting point to learn what is schema.org markup and how you can use it on your website to improve engagement metrics, CTR and a lot more (from semantic analytics to building your own chatbot).\r\rhttps://www.slideshare.net/cyberandy/aipowered-seo-structured-data-semantics-wordlift\r\rAs Google anticipated already, we also expect to see the implementation of schema.org markup in different areas of the content industry. The Trust Project is a clear example of news organizations and tech giants like Facebook, Google, Bing and Twitter converging on schema.org to markup high quality news and implement fact checking with semantic markup.\r\rAnother area of development for schema.org in 2018 is the implementation of Blockchain ID for schema:Person and Blockchain certificates that can enable innovative new ways to do SEO and to share value in the publishing sector.\r\rYou might have noticed that Bitcoin is continuing to grow in terms of adoption. What you might have missed, is that, most importantly, its underlying technology called blockchain (a digital ledger that transparently stores any value transactions in a peer-to-peer network) can have a huge impact on how value is re-distributed between search marketing agencies, content producers, website owners and advertisers.\r\rNew business models can arise by the implementation of smart contract agreements. In the publishing sector, we\u2019ve seen already in 2017 platforms like Steem - a blockchain-based rewards social networks that monetizes content - using their own cryptocurrency (BitCoin compatible) and other initiatives that could greatly benefit from a broader adoption of Blockchain technologies.\r\rWhile to this point there are only proposals to add Blockchain ID to schema.org, work has been in progress in the past months and this can really disrupt both the search engine marketing industry and digital advertising.\r\r2. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\rA lot of the discussion on how AI is transforming SEO really has to do with RankBrain and other machine learning algorithms that are impacting how content is prioritized over Google search results -- but also on the Facebook news stream, as well as Twitter search results. All these changes boiled down to three aspects:\r\r \tUX is king. Machines tend to prioritize content that is considered more engaging for the end users. To do so, they need to better understand and disambiguate content (and we\u2019re back to the importance of schema.org and semantic SEO techniques) and to analyze the user behaviours by looking at metrics such as the dwell time (this is really how much time the user is spending on your page). RankBrain is an example here. This newly introduced algorithm, now considered the third most important ranking factor, takes in great consideration the time a user spends on your page. Google Senior Fellow Jeff Dean recently explained that the dwell time is when:\r\u201csomeone clicks on a page and stays on that page, before going back to the search results page\u201d\rThere are also now interesting studies documenting the dwell time and the correlation with rankings (see for instance an industry report from Search Metrics). On average, for a top 10 Google result, the dwell time is 3 minutes and 10 seconds. This is quite a lot of time if you compare it with the average time spent on a page and it\u2019s clear that if a reader engages on a piece of content for so long, it\u2019s most likely that he or she likes the page and finds it informative enough for that specific search intent.\r \tClick-Through-Rate is Queen. Just like dwell time, CTR is one of those metrics that computers can use to prioritize your content. This is true for organic search results as well as for paid advertising. When a user clicks on a content it means that he or she thinks that this content is good. When many users click on a page, above-average CTR for that query (yes, CTR is very relative), the content gets boosted and will stick to the top. This is particularly true nowadays on Google when advertising, featured snippets and knowledge panels make it very hard for a user to land on a webpage and... in 2018 this is just going to get worst.The real interpreter of CTR is Larry Kim and his advice on creating Unicorn content. Larry has been analyzing the polarization of CTR in organic search as well as in social streams and his marketing strategies are a must read for every digital marketers in 2018. Read it up from this article on Medium.\r \tData is the new oil in SEO. As machines get smarter (or dumber in some cases), marketers need to adjust and from traditional SEO techniques need to move into the realm of digital marketing. From analyzing the correlation between the indexing of your website from Google with your social activity to using machine-learning to prioritize backlinks opportunities the so called \u201cModern SEO\u201d is all about data.\r\rhttps://twitter.com/JohnMu/status/925834170382848008?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwI\r\rI had the pleasure of meeting in real life, during SMXL Milan 2017, Michael King (iPullRank on Twitter) and his deck on Modern SEO is your definite guide to become a data ninja in the search engine world.\r\r\r3. Mobile-first index, Accelerated Mobile Pages and Progressive Web Apps\rSpeed gets bigger and bigger. Having a super fast mobile website in 2018 is not going to be an option but a key technical requirement for SEO. With Google that is about to deploy worldwide its mobile-first index optimizing the user experience on mobile devices is becoming crucial. \r\rRemember that already 57% of the web traffic is coming from mobile devices as a recent report from BrightEdge announced a few months ago. \r\rIn mobile search, few factors really affect search rankings: a) context of the search intent (here once again, structured data helps) and b) accessibility of the content (this really means the speed at which the user perceives your content).\r\rGoogle\u2019s Accelerated Mobile Pages has been, in 2017 one of the most debatable web technologies, but, again, in a lot of cases, you cannot live without it. Believe me. Users reading Google AMP pages are spending 35 percent more time on average than users accessing standard mobile web pages. We\u2019ve celebrated two years since the launch of the AMP project and in 2018 AMP will definitely get bigger. \r\rIf you want to master AMP and if your website is not already blazing fast do yourself a favor and study the precious advices of Aleyda Sol\u00ecs on when and how to implement AMP on your website.\r\r\r\rIn the technical SEO space there is a lot going on and a good start is to focus on the three principles of positional SEO by Britney Muller\u00a0SEO &amp; Content Architect at MOZ:\r\rhttps://twitter.com/Spindox_It/status/930385330234159109?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\r\rStart learning about Progressive Web Applications and all the tactics that Britney shared in her latest keynote ?\r\rhttps://youtu.be/s13d5saaPuM\r\rAlso read very carefully the slide deck of Nichola Stott (co-founder of Erudite): \u201cFast is the Only Speed\u201d - on how to make the Google Mobile-Friendly Test tool follow in love with your website.\r\rAnd remember - as Google points out - that 53% of your users will abandon your website if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load!\r\r4. Search is Everywhere \rThink outside of the (search) box\rReally the best way to find out how search marketing is evolving is to dedicate some time following the advices of Rand Fishkin who literally created this industry a long time ago. Meeting Rand at SMXL Milan 2017 has been truly inspirational.\r\rIn the year of the Russian Hacking and Influencing the US Election, Rand had the courage to start his talk on cultural biases and gender inequality. \r\rYes this is also SEO and it\u2019s worth your attention. \r\rAs a pure AI-first approach moves forward and it gets harder and harder to gain organic visibility on search results, marketers need to revamp their digital strategies and look with new eyes to threats and opportunities.\r\rHere is the deck on Cultural Conditioning by Rand Fishkin.\r\rhttps://www.slideshare.net/randfish/the-invisible-giant-that-mucks-up-our-marketing\r\r5. Voice search, chatbots and personal assistant search optimization \rLast but not least we need to focus on voice ready content, voice search and personal assistant search optimization. Bing in 2017 has already introduced chatbots in their enriched organic search result as well as in paid results and will continue to make it easier for consumer to bypass websites and to hook directly to smart digital assistants and chatbots.\r\rhttps://twitter.com/wordliftit/status/930826363078086657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\r\rFew steps that you can follow can really help you build voice-ready content that engage your audience:\r\r \toptimize content for featured snippets,\r \tkeep the focus on long tail conversational keywords,\r \tinclude question and answers in your content,\r \tuse entities - structuring content using entity extraction can help search engines and chatbots designers effectively re-use your content within their conversational experiences.\r\rhttps://twitter.com/wordliftit/status/930823061632421888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\r\rPurna Virji, from Bing, is by far one of the most influential SEO experts in the emerging voice search arena and definitely there is so much to learn from her (including her views on marriage).\r\r\r\rI have been happily coding and experimenting with both voice search and conversational UIs driven by semantically structured content and I foresee emerging techniques to do SEO in 2018 that specifically promotes \u2018intents\u2019 (what users ask to personal assistants) and help you analyze conversation metrics (a new area of analytics whose goal is to let you improve your own chatbot by reporting on previous interactions).\r\rHere is an example of how I turned our website into a chatbot and how I plan to make your websites talk in 2018.\r\rhttps://twitter.com/cyberandy/status/930747792070533120?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\r\rIt's been a real pleasure to spend these two days in Milan, learning and sharing knowledge with SEO world-class experts.\r\rAdam Lynch, CMO from our close partner WooRank, was as excited as I was, and here is his final wrap-up for 2018:\rIt is clear that 2018 is going to be a seminal year for SEO. \r\rThe progression towards a customer centric approach and the focus on structured data as a way to achieve this will impact us all. We will have to be relentlessly focussed on the creation of user focussed, high-quality and semantically structured content to stand out from our competition. \r\rI strongly believe the structuring and analysis of this data will become a day-to-day part of an SEO\u2019s job...",

        "text": "The Top 5 SEO Trends to Watch in 2019 Conversational AI at the center of your content strategy!\r2019 will be the year of voice search. This article\u00a0explores how conversational AI\u00a0and voice queries are\u00a0driving the top SEO trends for this year.\rWhat are the top trends for SEO in 2019?\rThe trends for SEO in 2019, one way or another, are linked with the growth of conversational AI, voice queries and\u00a0the emergence of knowledge graphs.\u00a0Here are the top 5 trends you need to watch in 2019:\r\r?\u00a01.\u00a0Conversational user intents and long-tail keywords\r?\u00a02.  Featured snippets and answer boxes\r?\u00a03. Structured data and knowledge graphs\r?\u00a04. Google News Optimization and Content Discovery\r?\u00a05. Technical SEO for less complicated and faster websites\r\rWe're already living in a world where 13% of Google searches are voice queries (here is a good article to read by Rebecca Sentance on what the future of voice search holds for us). The very enthusiastic supporters of the voice search bandwagon might even say that by 2020 one every two searches will come from voice but predictions, as we know, are very hard to make especially in the marketing world.\r\rWhat we have seen for sure in 2018 is that voice search is shaping the entire SEO industry. As SEO Expert Aleyda Solis pointed out recently, voice search is driving \u201ca bigger shift\u201d, from specific \u201cresults\u201d to \u201canswers\u201d that become part of a continuous \u201cconversational search journey\u201d.\r\rArtificial Intelligence, though, is the real enabler behind this transition. It was back in December 2016 when, Andrew NG Chief Scientist at Baidu at the time, predicted that speech-recognition accuracy going from 95% to 99%, would have moved the needle in terms of mass adoption of voice interfaces.\r\rAs speech-recognition accuracy goes from 95% to 99%, we'll go from barely using it to using all the time! https://t.co/TfjqJLDTPJ\r\u2014 Andrew Ng (@AndrewYNg) December 16, 2016\rAs of today machine learning and semantic networks are being constantly used to provide a personalised user experience across a multitude of channels, to guide the user across different tasks (from driving directions, to cooking, from podcast discovery to news reading and \"listening\") and to help us find what matters the most. \r\rIn 2018 we witnessed knowledge graphs entering the Gartner hype cycle as emergent technology forming the bridge between humans, knowledge and conversational AI. In 2018 not only researchers and universities, but also industry companies have been heavily investing in knowledge graphs and not only Amazon with its product graph, Facebook with the Graph API, IBM with Watson, Microsoft with Satori and Google with its own Knowledge Graph but also Internet startups like Airbnb, Zalando and many others have committed resources for the creation of functional knowledge graphs meant to support general-purpose reasoning, inference and above all an improved search experience.\rIn conclusion, we don\u2019t expect the entire world to shift to voice but we can predict that conversational AI and a combination of voice and touch interactions will drive SEO in 2019.\rIn 2019 SEOs and marketers have to prepare for a more human-driven and conversational web. Voice search will not disrupt every business but it is a driving force in the entire content marketing sector. The 2019 trends for SEO, one way or another, are linked with the growth of conversational AI and the emergence of knowledge graphs.\r\r1. Conversational user intents and long-tail keywords\rFocusing on the user intent is going to be strategic. We expect that the user search intents will be likely expressed in a more advanced range of sophisticated conversational queries. Focusing on long-tail keywords that target a specific user (in a specific context) will be simpler (and wiser in most cases) than going after a broad keyword. \r\rWhen and if, we decide to go broad and to target a more general intent (ie. \"business model\") we shall provide enough structure (and data) to help users (and machines) find the winning answer by further refining the initial request as if they were having a dialogue with the website (\"Are you interested in the business model of Apple or of a startup?\"). \r\rImagine preparing content as if the user would be always asking their questions to a Google Home or another voice-first device. We need to prepare all the possible answers that a conversation around that topic might trigger. We need to guide the user from the initial request to a deeper discovery of the available content and we need to match the format the user is looking for (some might like to activate a video, while others might prefer a long-format article). \u00a0\u00a0\r\r2. Featured snippets and answer boxes\rAs a result of the information overload, and due to the growth of queries carried out via smart speakers (statistics talk about 26.4 million daily voice queries) machines will constantly need to sum up a vast amount of information, find what is really relevant for us and provide a decent speakable version of our content. While parsing language remains one of the grand challenges of artificial intelligence good results are today being achieved by Google Featured Snippets, Bing Expanded Answer and the alike. Visibility across the SERP and throughout the AI-first user experience is very much dependent on answer boxes and featured snippets. Once again, this is currently an aspect of SEO that involves mobile as well as the desktop but it is fueled by the growth of conversational AI. We shall prepare content that can be easily summarised and read aloud; we also need to\u00a0leverage on structured data to help machines disambiguate the context\u00a0and to support the meaningful summarization of it.\r\r3. Structured data and knowledge graphs\rLinked data, knowledge graphs and schema markup helps us connect content with a specific search intent using usage patterns that are now embedded in the search experience. A vast variety of Google SERP features are already dependent on structured data and more will come in 2019. Here below a quick overview highlighting in blue the SERP features that are linked with the use of structured data.\r\rGoogle Search Features\u00a0(the original list is from BrightEdge) in blue items that have some connection with schema markup.\r\rStructured data is foundational in the conversational era as it provides well-defined information for a wide range of encoded user intents. Machine learning needs to be trained across a vast amount of semantically relevant datasets. This is true for commercial search engines, for smart assistants and for our own internal user experience - once again our website needs to become capable of answering to specific intents by guiding the user where it matters the most. \r\rKnowledge Graph Entities are being used by the Google Assistant for answering simple questions.\r\r\r4. Google News optimization\u00a0and content discovery\rPre-emptive knowledge delivery and content discovery have been a trend for a few years now. This basically means helping users discover content in a serendipitous way and without searching for. In September 2018 Google introduced the Google feed \u201cto surface relevant content [...], even when you\u2019re not searching for\u201d. \r\rBeing able to predict the information need in a queryless way is a major focus in Google\u2019s future of Search and it will be strategic for all major consumer brands (Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft and Apple). If we focus on Google alone we can see that, content being proposed in Google Discover is made of three types: youtube videos and fresh visual content, evergreen content like recipes and news articles. As we have seen in the checklist to optimize for Google Top Stories being present in Google News has become an important asset since the explosion of the fake news scandal (Google News content represent a selection of somehow validated and authoritative content that Google - and other players - can trust). While not all websites are eligible for Google News, if you are producing fresh content for your industry this is definitely a time to consider Google News as a new distribution channel. This becomes even more strategic these days since Google announced an upcoming voice-driven version of Google News for the Google Assistant.\r\r\r5. Technical SEO for less complicated and faster websites\rIn 20 years we failed in building a simpler Web. Websites are becoming more and more complicated with an endless number of (sometimes useless) routines that run every time a browser hits the\u00a0first page. I am not going to get into the topic but there is a brilliant article that you should read to learn about the importance of simplicity and why (the article is titled The Bullshit Web and is by Nick Heer a front-end developer from Canada) we now have to invest on\u00a0technical SEO. Once again the key aspect in technical SEO - in relation with the conversation AI - is speed.\r\rAs highlighted in a study done this year by Backlinko -\u00a0content that is brought into the Google Assistant is only the content that renders super fast. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\r\rA Voice Search study by Backlinko on the importance of page speed.\r\rPage Speed has effectively become a mobile ranking factor as announced by Google this last July and will continue to impact on SERP features (featured snippets, top stories etc.) \u00a0and voice search in 2019. Another major aspect that we expect to keep on driving organic growth is the support for Accelerated Mobile Pages. \rSearch in 2019, besides these key 5 trends, will be once again about building relationships, providing valuable answers to people needs and keeping the audience at the very center of the content strategy.\rBy\u00a0creating exceptional content and using artificial intelligence tools for SEO you\u00a0will keep your website ahead of the curve!\rStill have a question?

        "text": "Keywords vs Entities: a Paradigm Shift in SEO Old vs. New SEO\rOnce upon a time, SEO was done through a means of finding the right keywords and placing them throughout website content with every synonym known to mankind. Being #1 was the goal and there was not a rich snippet in sight. But one day, Google launched its knowledge graph, spreading entities and rich snippets far and wide on the SERP. Things might not have changed all at once, but over time, entities became all the new rage while keywords became much less relevant. The #1 spot was never the same with knowledge cards and People Also Asked\u00a0boxes. In short, SEO is not what it used to be.\r\rWhether we like it or not, the nature of SEO has drastically changed thanks, in part, to the emergence of entities. While keywords are far from extinct, their importance has drastically diminished in favor of entities. In a sense, keywords and entities are interconnected as they both utilize each others functions to better serve knowledge graphs. As such, it\u2019s important to understand their functions, their differences, and how they have changed SEO.\u00a0\rKeywords\r\r\rKeywords are somewhat self-explanatory and easy to understand. Keywords are words that are a focal point of content and are what users type in queries in order to find the answers or content that they\u2019re looking for. Keywords can be picked out from a question or long-form query or used entirely on their own.\r\rIf you are looking for cat videos online, common keywords may include things like: cat, kitty, cute, playing, videos, clips, compilation, etc. You might search for a long-tail query like, \u201ccute cats playing with each other video compilation\u201d or even something as short as, \u201ccute kitten video.\u201d\rEntities\r\r\rEntities are concepts or ideas that have distinct attributes and characteristics which can be shared with others of its kind. They are connected within a knowledge graph, such as the one provided by Google and can be accessed by anyone. While each entity is independent, it has direct and indirect relations with other entities based on common attributes. They are also not required to conform to a specific language.\r\rGoing back to our example on cat videos, we can find an entity on cats. The entity can describe things about cats, such as they are an animal, carnivorous, their taxonomy, names in other languages like Japanese or Latin; and many other facts and characteristics about cats.\u00a0\r\rThe important thing to know about how entities work is that entities share heavy connections with each other. Think of them as people, places, things or concepts that have attributes and relations with other people, places, things or concepts.\r\rSimilarly, cats as an entity are connected to other entities based on its relationship with them. Such as that it is a mammal, like whales, tigers, and bats; or that it has different breeds, like Scottish Fold, Siamese, or Egyptian Mau.\rHow Entities Changed SEO\rEntities have made conducting SEO both more useful and complicated. In the past, conducting SEO required proper utilization of keywords whereas now, SEO is focused on developing connections with entities and providing answers in the knowledge graph. While there are many minute changes to SERP function, there are three major takeaways in how entities have changed the SEO game:\r\r \tIncreased mobile capabilities: thanks to entities, SEO has expanded to mobile results, as it is now easier to search for and find answers provided by entities using mobile search. It has also paved the way for mobile-first indexing, where mobile results have taken priority over desktop search. So now, you can learn all about cats in a fun, mobile-friendly manner.\r \tNo need for a thesaurus or translator: since entities know what synonyms and translations exist for that word, there\u2019s no need to have to use translations or utilize every possible synonym on your webpage. Now, you can utilize an entity for every available language and every varying name possible. You can use \u201ccat\u201d along with \u201cgato\u201d and \u201ckitty.\u201d\u00a0\r \tRich snippets &amp; structured data: with entities as the new key focus of SEO, rich snippets are now the new priority over getting the #1 ranking. Using structured data in your article, you can contribute to entities on search engine knowledge graphs and get your content featured in a rich snippet. For instance, answering a common question about cats in a PAA rich snippet.\r\rAre Keywords Still Relevant?\rAlthough entities may have taken the center stage of the SEO show, keywords still have a major role to play. Keywords are still used to help find and connect your content to entities (whether on the Google Knowledge Graph or an internal knowledge graph). Utilizing keywords can help Google identify the content of your webpage and understand it using entities. This is a particularly useful off-page tactic to get others to view your content.\r\rFor an on-page tactic, you can develop entities for an internal knowledge graph for your organization, company or website. We use our own at WordLift and you have seen some of our keywords linked to different pages in this very article. Context cards have provided some information on these different entities listed. You can scroll around and find plenty of context cards linked to our entities in our article.\rThe Magical Kingdom of SEO\rSo while it seems that the changes in SEO may be beyond your control, this might not be the case. Although entities have taken over, keywords still have their place. In addition, the changes made because of the development of entities have brought welcome changes to the SEO landscape from mobile results and rich snippets. It turns out they weren\u2019t so scary after all.\r\rSo while some SEO specialists may some things to learn, these new changes can bring about a greater user experience and a whole new means of bringing traffic to websites. So the SEO specialists went to sleep that night, knowing that all was more than just well in the magical kingdom of SEO, and they all lived happily ever after.\r\rIf you'd like to learn more about how SEO has changed and the significance of entities, check out our webinar with Cindy Krum in the WordLift Academy.\r\r",

        "text": "Structured Data For Semantic Web Analytics IntroductionAdding structured data to your website means enriching your data with information that makes your content easier for Google and search engines to understand. This way, your website and the search engines can talk to each other, allowing you to have a richer representation of your content in Google's SERPs and increase organic traffic. You'll then get more clicks and growth for your business.&nbsp;With structured data in modern SEO, you can create an impact, and this impact is measurable whether you have a large or small business.Focus on the importance of structured data beyond numbers (clicks, impressions, etc) and the advantage that you can gain in modern SEO.&nbsp;Much of the adoption we see of modern standards like schema.org (particularly via json-ld) appears to be motivated by organizations and individuals who wish to take advantage of search engines\u2019 support (and rewards) for providing data about their pages and content but outside of this, there\u2019s a rich landscape of people who use structured data to enrich their pages for other reasons.&nbsp; Web AlmanacSo structured data is not just the data we prepare for Google; it's data that helps you understand the meaning of web pages.&nbsp;If you want to learn how to get semantic analytics with WordLift, read our article.What Is Structured Data For Semantic Analytics?The Semantic Web has changed the way we approach web content. As Tim Berners Lee himself says, the world is not made of words but is made of something more powerful: data. This means that to improve search engines' understanding of web content, it is necessary to have a high-quality dataset enriched with information in structured data.Structured data allows Google and search engines to understand what you're talking about on your website and rank better by returning users with enriched results in SERPs. In this way, users can find relevant information that better meets their search intent.&nbsp;We talk about entities and no longer about keywords. They represent \"concepts\" and allow machines (Google and search engines, voice assistants, etc.) to interpret what we know about a person, organization, place, or anything described in a document.In this scenario, Semantic Web Analytics is the use of named entities and linked vocabularies such as schema.org to analyze the traffic of a website.With this type of analysis, you'll start from your website's structured data, and you'll be able to cross-reference it with the data from Google Analytics, Google Search Console or your CRM. In this way, you'll be able to learn more about your users/customers and their behaviors, gaining a strategic advantage over impression and traffic data alone. As we'll see below, with just a few clicks, you can extract structured data from web pages and blend it, in Google Data Studio, with traffic from Google Analytics.&nbsp;Google Data Studio DashboardHow To Use Structured Data For Semantic AnalyticsIt's clear that structuring information goes beyond search engine support and can also provide value in web metrics analysis.&nbsp;At this point, we show you how you can extract structured data from web pages and blend it with Google Analytics traffic in Google Data Studio. You'll also see how this will allow you to gain insights into web analytics.We start from a demo website that we built for demonstration purposes. If you have a small business, with a small number of products, you can crawl your content by using a Streamlit application. Otherwise, if you are at a more advanced level and you have a large number of products, you can use Colab, working with the SEO crawler of Advertools, the free library created by Elias Dabbas, available here. With this system, you can crawl hundreds of thousands of URLs. But it has a pitfall: it is not able to detect structured data that has been injected with javascript.&nbsp;&nbsp;Streamlit Web AppColabThen the data will be brought by the crawler in Google Sheets and blended in Google Data Studio in order to have one single view.You can create a Data Studio Dashboard where you can select and see some specific insights. Here, for example, you can see the breakdown of the session in Google Analytics with the category. So we can see that clothing is accounting for 50% for the session.&nbsp;How Do Blended Sources In Google Data Studio Work? Blending Data Is Simple.As you can see in the image, you have tables (in our case, Google Sheets and Google Analytics) and a list of available fields that you can use from this table within the join to create a view of combined fields.&nbsp;Then you have the join configuration; that is how you want to blend this data. You can decide to take everything from the left table that overlaps with the right table, or you want to look at the strict overlap of the inner.&nbsp;Then you have the name of the blended source that you will create and the fields that you will represent inside this blended source which is a view on one, two or more tables combined by a unique key. In this example, the unique key is the URL.&nbsp;You are using the URL on both sides to combine them and these allow you to look at the analytic, for instance the session, by looking at the category.&nbsp;If you want to see something more advanced, you can blend the second Spreadsheet with Google Analytics. In this case, you have more data, such as the color and the brand name, and you can create a chart using the product category, the session, and the price. This way, you can see traffic for each product category and the price. You can also see the breakdown of the colors and the brands.&nbsp;You can play with different combinations in order to have the right data. Extracting structured data from your web pages and blending it with Google Analytics data gives you a more precise and more accurate picture of your users' behavior with just a few clicks. This is particularly useful to improve your marketing strategy and grow your business in a data-driven way.&nbsp;Keep In Mind: Structured Data Has Its Pitfalls.&nbsp;Structured data, when injected using Javascript, cannot be easily crawled;Data is messy and/or inconsistent;Multiple syntaxes appear on the same page;&nbsp;Multiple tools can add contradicting statements;&nbsp;&nbsp;Competitors have better data.We discussed this topic in the webinar Google Data Studio Structuring SEO Data Tips&amp;Tricks, hosted with Windsor.AI - Watch the video. https://youtu.be/_umpFOMEeyQIf you want to know how to create a Web Analytics Dashboard using Google Data Studio, traffic data from\u00a0Google Analytics, and WordLift, read this article.Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat is Semantic Web Analysis?Semantic Web Analytics is the analysis of a website's traffic done using named entities and related vocabularies such as schema.org.With this analysis, you can start from the website's structured data and cross-reference it with data from Google Analytics, Google Search Console, or other CRM. In this way, you can learn more about user and customer behavior and gain a competitive advantage beyond just analyzing impressions and traffic.[et_pb_section global_module=\"10893\"][/et_pb_section][wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

Through activities in education solutions, publishing, content marketing and family business networking the El Agamy family is growing its companies between Europe and the Middle East.

Two years later, she added a new branch to her business with Orbis Terra Media, a content studio enabling brands to achieve narrative consistency across multiple platforms to reach their audience.Back in 2017, Ramia was looking for a solution to reach a wider online audience to establish Tharawat Magazine as the preeminent publisher on family business topics.That's when we met. Tharawat Magazine's team wanted to introduce an SEO approach in their editorial workflow.She had a conversation with our business developer Gennaro -- at first, she was sceptical. She tried WordLift, however, and after using it for a few months, she became one of our first VIP clients, adopting our tailored SEO services as a part of Tharawat's editorial workflow. Joining forces has proven highly beneficial: in the last 5 months, Tharawat Magazine has grown by +321% in terms of traffic. It is one of our best SEO case studies.\u00a0We also had the chance to refine a bespoke workflow built around a rich and well-organized editorial plan, but this is another story.We spoke with Ramia to learn more about the fascinating world of family business.Let's begin with a very simple question: what is Tharawat Magazine, and how is it structured?Today, Tharawat Magazine is one of the world's foremost publications on family-owned businesses.

This is a 64% increase month over month - how did this happen?We attribute this success almost entirely to our collaboration with the WordLift team. When we came across the WordLift solution two years ago, we were under-utilizing the wealth of content we had. WordLift stepped in, cleaned up and structured over 1000 articles to increase their visibility. The accelerated returns over the last 5 months are a result of our editorial team's understanding of how to read the traffic data to make editorial planning more SEO friendly.[caption id=\"attachment_11001\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1012\"] Learn more about Tharawat Magazine's case[/caption]Speaking of the editorial team, how do you organize their work?We are fully decentralized; OTM team members work from around the world and come together around our magazine. We work with SaaS like Asana and HubSpot to coordinate our workflow and are also fully integrated with the WordLift team on Slack. We create original content, so we always start with the audio from recorded interviews, which is then transcribed and worked into written articles for the website and print and then resourced for our podcast the Family Business Voice.We also field submissions from all over the world -- the work of experts and academics who wish to share their latest insights on matters related family business.From WordLift, we've learned the importance of creating SEO friendly content like industry-specific listicles that allow easy structuring and get rewarded by high rankings on Google SERP.Tharawat Magazine is devoted to a very specific vertical: family business. To its credit, Tharawat Magazine also is a family business. Does it make your editorial work easier?My family owns Orbis Terra Media, and we founded Tharawat Magazine. So let\u2019s just say we really know what we are talking about when we publish family business stories.However, the real force behind the success of Tharawat Magazine is our editorial team and the many family businesses who agree to share their stories with us.Tharawat Magazine is the editorial side of a larger project, Orbis Terra Media, which you define as a content studio. Why did you decide to leverage your experience in content creation to provide a set services?We founded Tharawat Magazine around 11 years ago in the middle of a major disruption in the publishing industry. After a few years, it became apparent to us that publishing alone would not result in the growth we wanted, and so we thought about what our strengths were. We knew that our skills in creating high-value and original content lent themselves well to content marketing services. So, we built Orbis Terra Media, which is now a global content studio. Coupled with a company culture keen on integrating technology and involving strategic partners such as the team at WordLift, we provide these services combining the best of our creative and editorial capabilities with data-based insights.

        "text": "From Knowledge Graphs to AI-powered SEO Using taxonomies, schemas and knowledge graphs to improve search engine rankings and web publishing workflowsStructured data&nbsp;has became the avenue toward advanced functionalities in Google (check out our rich results guide) and at the same time, the bridge between traditional search and voice search.Here is an abstract of Andrea Volpini's presentation at Connected Data London.It all started with... Schema.orgThe starting point of all this process started was the foundation of schema.org,&nbsp;the de-facto standard for Linked Data development, developed by and for search engines.&nbsp; While structured data implemented through Schema is a critical element for successful SEO campaigns; to enable a brand to resonate via Google's search results, it becomes crucial to leverage open linked data standards.Why Semantic Open Data are Relevant for SEO TodaySemantic Open Data are the foundation of the Semantic Web and make&nbsp;a Knowledge Graph possible.Following an EU regulation introduced first in France, Google used structured data as implicit consent for content to become open on the web. In short, structured data enable publishers and content creators to have wider control over their content and how they want Google to repurpose it in its search results (read structured data as an opt-in mechanism for rich results).Thus, schema.org and structured data become a wider mechanism than what we see from rich results. They enable&nbsp;publishers of content to have: \twider visibility for their brand \tmore control over their content.The rise of synthetic queriesAnother key element is given by the fact that Google uses structured data to generate queries in its&nbsp;Knowledge Graph. What Bill Slawski called synthetic query, as we discussed in the interview with him here.&nbsp;What that means is that if Google doesn't have enough volume on a query, it might still create it by scraping structured data.Therefore, you can generate demand for your own brand by using structured data.Structured Data and Voice AssistantsWith Speakable Schema Markup&nbsp;it's possible to prompt answers within the Google Assistant, which are fetched from website content, thus making the content prone to be reused within Google Assistants.Now it's possible also to claim Actions from the structured data provided from the content of a website, which makes it possible to build custom experiences within the voice assistants.All the above is possible by enabling within the structured data, the&nbsp;Linked Open Data Standard, and create your Knowledge Graph.If you want to learn more, download the full presentation by Andrea Volpini.Download the full presentation&nbsp;",

        "text": "How to integrate WordLift Semantic tracking with Google Analytics via Google Tag Manager Semantic Web Analytics is a powerful feature that was introduced with Wordlift 3.20 which allows you to better track your content and understand your audience. With the help of this feature, you can track entity usage across pages which in turn allows you to uncover the topics your visitors are interested in (thus you need to write more on those topics) and the topics which are not that popular among visitors.If enabled, WordLift will send the Semantic Web data directly to your Google Analytics, which is perfectly fine if you have the Google Analytics tracking installed directly on the site or via a plugin. However, if your Google Analytics tracking is installed via Google Tag Manager, the default integration will not work so a custom integration via GTM will have to be performed.Luckily, integrating the semantic entity tracking via GTM is really easy (as you will see below) so you don\u2019t need to hire a Google Analytics expert for this.To integrate semantic web analytics via Google Tag Manager you need to do 5 things: \tEnable \u201cAnalytics Settings\u201d in WordLift plugin; \tCreate the \u201cEntity Type\u201d and \u201cEntity URI\u201d custom dimensions in Google Analytics; \tAdd the required variables in Google Tag Manager; \tCreate the trigger to fire the GTM entity tag; \tCreate the tag which sends the event with the entity data to Google Analytics.Enabling \u201cAnalytics Settings\u201d in WordLift pluginIn your Wordpress dashboard, navigate to WordLift / Settings / Analytic Settings and enable the analytic settings.Creating the \u201cEntity Type\u201d and \u201cEntity URI\u201d custom dimensions in Google Analytics After you have enabled analytics settings in WordLift, you need to go to the admin area of your Google Analytics account, and under property settings, click on \u201cCustom dimensions\u201d.In there, you need to create 2 custom dimensions with the scope set to \u201cHit\u201d type. In our example we have named the custom dimensions \u201cEntity URI\u201d and \u201cEntity Type\u201d.Adding the required variables in Google Tag ManagerAfter creating the custom dimensions in Google Analytics, we need to create the variables which we will use to pass data from WordLift to Google Tag Manager and from there, to Google Analytics.In total, in this step we need to create the following variables: event_action, wl_event_category, wl_event_label, wl_event_value, wl_event_uri, wl_index_uri, wl_event_type, wl_index_type.For this, open Google Tag Manager, navigate to \u201cVariables\u201d from the left menu and click on the \u201cNew\u201d button.In the panel that appeared, we need to enter the name of the variable (ex: event_action) and set the variable type as Data Layer variable with the \u201cData Layer Variable Name\u201d field set to the name of the variable (ex: event_action). After configuring the variables, we need to click on the save button.We need to repeat this process for all of the variables mentioned above. Next, in the \u201cGoogle Analytics Settings\u201d variable (if you don\u2019t have one you need to create it), by clicking on \u201cMore Settings\u201d (1), open the \u201cCustom dimensions\u201d options (2). In there, click on \u201c+ Add Custom Dimension\u201d button and in the \u201cIndex\u201d field, click on the \u201c+\u201d button (3) and select the \u201cwl_index_uri\u201d variable while in the \u201cDimension Value\u201d field select the \u201cwl_event_uri\u201d variable.Next, in exactly the same way, add the \u201cwl_index_type\u201d \u2013 \u201cwl_event_type\u201d variables in the next custom dimension and click save (4).Creating the GTM triggerAfter creating the required variables, we need to create a trigger that will fire our entity event tag. For this, navigate to \u201cTriggers\u201d menu and click on \u201cNew\u201d.A new box will appear and in there, choose the trigger type as \u201cCustom Event\u201d (1) and in the \u201cEvent name\u201d field, enter \u201cMentions\u201d(2). In the \u201cThis trigger fires on\u201d section, select \u201cSome Custom Events\u201d (3) and choose \u201cevent_action\u201d equals \u201cMentions\u201d (4). Give the trigger a descriptive name such as \u201cMentions\u201d (5) and click save (6).Creating the entity event tag in GTMAfter we have created the variables and trigger, we can create the tag which will send the data to our GA property. For this, in the \u201cTag\u201d menu, click on \u201cNew\u201d and in the panel which appeared, click on the \u201cTag Configuration\u201d area and select \u201cGoogle Analytics: Universal Analytics\u201d.After this, set the \u201cTrack Type\u201d to \u201cEvent\u201d, category to {{wl_event_category}}, action to {{event_action}}, label to {{wl_event_label}} and value to {{wl_event_value}}.We also need to set the \u201cNon-Interaction Hit\u201d option to \u201ctrue\u201d so that this event would not affect the bounce rate and in the \u201cGoogle Analytics Settings\u201d section, we need to choose the variable \u201cGoogle Analytics Settings\u201dIn the trigger section of the tag we need to select the \u201cMentions\u201d trigger which we created earlier.After saving the tag, you can enable the preview and debug mode to check if the tag is firing correctly and if data is being sent to Google Analytics. If everything is working fine, you can go ahead and publish the container.With this integration, you will be able to track page entities in Google Analytics, both as events and as custom dimensions. Later, you will be able to view and analyze the data either in the \u201cEvents\u201d report from Google Analytics or if you want to take your reporting and analysis to the next level, you can use Google Data Studio and import this beautiful dashboard created by Martin Reichhart from Salzburgerland.[et_pb_section global_module=\"11573\"][/et_pb_section]",

We decided to ask the AI what's happening with this update. If humans aren't able to keep up with the machine let the machine tell us what's going on.\r\rSurprisingly we got some interesting answers (questions are from humans - answers come from a neural network we trained)!\rWhen was the update released?\u00a0\rAI: Monday, June 3, here is a summary of what we know so far. Sources say the update was pre-announced and rolled out on June 3rd. It is still very early, but Google is tweaking its algorithm and is processing the data.\rWhat are the core updates?\rAI: Core Updates are Google Updates that do not have a clear specific focus on a certain kind of search query or particular website characteristics. Instead, they make more subtle changes \u201cunder the hood\u201d. While other major, well-known Google Updates like Panda or Penguin specifically target things like content quality or backlinks, Core Updates tend to impact websites in a wide range of areas. These updates to Google\u2019s core algorithm are released several times a year. The first Google Core Update was recorded by Searchmetrics in January 2016.\rWhat can I do if my rankings collapse after a Google Update?\rAI: At the end of 2018, Google provided some explanation of its Core Updates, stating that there aren\u2019t any specific errors that webmasters can correct to recover lost rankings after a Core Update. Instead, Google recommends offering users the best-possible content \u2013 this is the best way of improving rankings. Google\u2019s recommended first step towards achieving this is to study the Google Search Quality Rater Guidelines. This document is designed to help quality raters understand, in not inconsiderable detail, how to classify and evaluate content.\rCan you tell us more about the DailyMail?\rAI: The SEO director of the website even seems to have taken to Google\u2019s help forums to report a huge drop, as spotted by the blog Search Engine Roundtable. He added that they saw their \u201cDiscover traffic drop by 90%\u201d and it \u201chas not improved.\u201d\rWhat sites have been impacted the most?\rAI: As of now, the update\u2019s made some major waves. As reported by Search Engine Land, early data from Sistrix, RankRanger, SearchMetrics, and Moz suggests there\u00a0have been some noticeable fluctuations in the rankings. Sistrex reports changes from 05.06. on 06.06 in the Google UK Index. They also note that the range of websites affected seems to be wider than previous updates. While the most recent updates were thought to have the most effect on YMYL sites, these ones appear to have widened the net to news\u00a0sites, retail sites, etc.\rIs Google evil?\u00a0\rAI: Google says the new core update is \u201cdefinitely noticeable.\u201d\r\rAnd since beginning its official rollout, that certainly seems to be the case.\rHow we did this\rWe\u00a0trained a neural network using TensorFlow and a recently released\u00a0large\u00a0transformer-based language model called GPT-2 released by the team of OpenAI.\r\r[et_pb_section global_module=\"10845\"][/et_pb_section]\r\rSEO is a fantastic field to work on.\u00a0There is always a new challenge to cope with and new things that we can learn to keep our traffic steady and to find the right audience. Core updates from Google are these events that shake the entire publishing and SEO industry as they can have a tectonic impact on traffic and search rankings, yet the dynamics of these updates remains obscure and can only be decoded after several weeks on a case-by-case basis.\r\r\t\t\t\t[/et_pb_text]\t\t\t[/et_pb_column]\t\t[/et_pb_row]\t[/et_pb_section]",

        "text": "How A.I. is disrupting web writing according to FREEYORK's founder What if artificial intelligence was the nurturing humus that the publishing industry and blogs\u00a0need to bloom again?\u00a0What if the future of blogging was in the virtual hands of an army of machines that can work together with professional writers to build and spread knowledge? This is the story of Sam Isma, founder and\u00a0publisher of the online design magazine FREEYORK, which publishes 25-30 articles a week employing just two editors. How do they do this? Let's look closer to understand Sam's visionary model and find out more about this SEO case study.A.I. is a mindset.Eclectic and creative, Sam is halfway between tech and design with a strong entrepreneurial mindset. After starting his career as a freelance graphic designer, he has studied computer science at the Eastern Mediterranean University in Mersin - where he graduated in computer science and marketing. In 2009 he founded FREEYORK, and nowadays he divides his mind and his time between his daytime job at IBM as a project manager, the management of his editorial project FREEYORK, and the organization of startup events. And he still manages to have some fun!FREEYORK: the editorial projectBorn as a community-driven platform, FREEYORK aims to spread the works and stories of upcoming artists.Previously, designers and other members of the\u00a0community\u00a0used to submit\u00a0their artworks and their stories, reaching a wide audience of design-lovers. Until a few weeks ago, all the work was done by two editors, plus Sam: just three persons were covering photography, design, illustration, street art, architecture, fashion, and food. Now, content submission is available again for website members, through a newly rolled-out system.FREEYORK is an eye wide-open\u00a0on all kind of visual contemporary art and publishes\u00a0a huge amount of inspiring content that helps artists and studios to get known and design-lovers to find new artists and creative ideas from all around the world.Unleashing the\u00a0power of A.I.FREEYORK's\u00a0editorial team has a\u00a0secret weapon to stay ahead of their competition, and that\u00a0secret weapon is A.I.Together with Sam and his small editorial team, there is a kind of cyber-team composed by A.I. tools, whose activities are now part of the magazine's editorial workflow. Day by day, A.I. is\u00a0helping the human team to do a\u00a0better job in content writing, editing, and organization.\"Our current workflow involves usage of three A.I. tools: an A.I. that writes the content of an article, another\u00a0A.I. that analyses it for grammar mistakes and replaces words that don't fit into a context, and WordLift\" explains Sam.\u00a0\"The first step is to collect some materials on a topic. After finding a few sources, we are giving them A.I. to rewrite. The second step is to analyze what first A.I. wrote,\u00a0fix grammar mistakes, and replace those words that don't make any sense. Finally, we let WordLift annotate an article and think of a catchy headline. A.I., unfortunately, is not good at this yet!\"So, basically, there is an A.I. working at each stage of the editorial process: writing, editing, and organizing. Oh, wait! What about human editors? What will they do in the future of the web? Here is what Sam has to say about this:\"It scares a lot of people for their future. Especially those who\u2019re working with numbers. I think that writers that use a lot of statistics and numerical data have a bigger chance to be replaced by A.I. As a perfect example, we can take The Associated Press that is using A.I. to write Minor League Baseball articles. That must be an alarming sign for sports writers. As for FREEYORK, I\u2019m hoping to find a perfect solution that will combine writing and editing in one tool\u00a0and on the top of that if it should read the text and think of a catchy headline. But nothing ever will substitute a well-written writer\u2019s opinion on a subject. In the future, I\u2019m hoping to form a brilliant team of editors that will write long-posts expressing their opinion on an artist\u2019s work, exhibitions, installations, and so on. Who doesn\u2019t appreciate a well-written article?\"Put this way, A.I. is more an opportunity than a threat, both for writers and publishers. State-of-the-art A.I. is ready to free journalists and writers from boring and repetitive tasks in their work day. What do you do when A.I. is quicker and cheaper than humans to write news and analysis? As a writer, you can focus on critics, opinions, and storytelling: that's human stuff and no machine can make it better than professionals.[caption id=\"attachment_5137\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1280\"] See New York from FREEYORK's point of view.

        "text": "Structured Data As Opt-In Mechanism To Google Rich Snippets On Tuesday, September 24, 2019, Google announced a very important update called&nbsp;More options to help websites preview their content on Google Search.Let's see what it is all about and why this was just the last of a set of chain reactions started with an EU copyright regulation.Google enabling publishers to specify how they want their content to show on the rich resultsGoogle's update explained:Google uses content previews, including text snippets and other media, to help people decide whether a result is relevant to their query. The type of preview shown depends on many factors, including the type of content a person is looking for and the kind of device they're viewing it on.And it continued:Google automatically generates previews in a way intended to help a user understand why the results shown are relevant to their search and why the user would want to visit the linked pages.Before the update, Google automatically and for the most part generated previews from content extracted from publishers' websites. A classic example is a featured snippet, or snippet of text extracted from articles on the web, with limited control from the publishers providing the content:A featured snippet (one of the rich elements showing on Google's search results pages) explaining \"what is structured data\" from the WordLift blog. We'll see why structured data matter so much with the current Google's update.&nbsp;The Google's update specified that when \"the&nbsp;robots meta tag is added to an HTML page's &lt;head&gt;, or specified via the x-robots-tag HTTP header\" it is possible to specify four types of information:&nbsp; \tnosnippet: the publisher can let the search engine know (through the HTML) that no snippet needs to be shown for that page.&nbsp; \tmax-snippet: enabling the publisher to specify the maximum number of characters Google can take from that page text to show a rich snippet. \tmax-video-preview: this new feature enables the publisher to specify the maximum duration in seconds that Google can show as a preview on the search results pages.&nbsp; \tmax-image-preview: enabling the publisher to tell what is the maximum size of image preview to be shown for images on the page.&nbsp;While Google gave the options to a publisher to specify and have more control over what and how much of the information extracted from their pages would be featured as rich result. On the other hand, it also specified that those are not applicable to the use of structured data, where the publishers can instead give way reacher information to the search engine, compared to the simple HTML tags:Content in&nbsp;structured data are eligible for display as&nbsp;rich results in search. These kinds of results do not conform to limits declared in the above meta robots settings, but rather, can be addressed with much greater specificity by limiting or modifying the content provided in the structured data.Opting-out from the designation of European Journalistic OrganizationAs publishers concerns were growing over the last years; as the number of no-click searches has been increasing substantially and European regulators passed a new copyright law to prevent Google to keep freely extracting content from web pages. To defend itself from potential legal risks, Google took into account a mechanism to allow publishers to opt-out from these rich elements.Indeed, as Google highlighted in the same update:We recognize that site owners may wish to independently adjust the extent of their preview content in search results. To make it easier for individual websites to define how much or which text should be available for snippeting and the extent to which other media should be included in their previews, we're now introducing several new settings for webmasters.As the update was rolled out, publishers around Europe (especially in France) started to receive emails from Google explaining that they were designated as \"European Journalistic Organizations\"As Google announced the new update, publishers in Europe started to see a notification in their search console (in the picture an example of an Italian publisher) where it stated that either the publishers changed the HTML specifics to explicitly tell the search engine to show rich results. Or opt-out from rich results through a new section of the search console.&nbsp;In other words, to avoid legal troubles in Europe, and more specifically in France, where the copyright law is getting rolled out. Google's team started to roll out this update:In the wake of new copyright law in France, Google will change the way it presents search results for European press publications to people in that country. Specifically, Google will no longer present snippets and thumbnail images in France for these publications unless publishers displaying content in France have specified how much of this content they want to show&nbsp; in search results.In short, it means that unless publishers have explicitly opted-in to rich results, is Google consider them as part of the new copyright law (the copyright law didn't give a specific designation of the publishers involved) it will designate them as European Journalistic Organization, thus the publishers will be excluded from Google advanced functionalities (Featured Snippets, Top Stories, Google News and More), with subsequent disastrous consequences on the traffic of those sites (many publishers' traffic is dependent on these new features).Structured data as implicit opt-in to Google's rich resultsDanny Sullivan referenced to several resources and among them, the&nbsp;European press publication setting, highlighting:Text snippets and thumbnail images can help people who are looking at your result by giving them a preview of your page and a better sense of how it relates to their search. To enable these text or image previews, use&nbsp;max-snippet or max-image-preview directives. You can enable other special features and&nbsp;rich results&nbsp;by using&nbsp;structured data.As in the update, Google specified that structured data would work in alternative to HTML tags in the text, Andrea Volpini asked Danny Sullivan, whether publishers could safely assume that by using structured data they were automatically opting-in to Google rich results:Andrea Volpini from WordLift asking Danny Sullivan Schema Markup and Structured Data would automatically elect the publisher as opting into rich results, thus avoiding any negative results and traffic drop caused by the new European regulation.Danny Sullivan confirmed that:And he called for John Muller to double-check. John Muller replied:That's correct. Regardless of designation as a European press publication, if you use structured data in the way that meets the requirements in the developer docs, then the page can be eligible for being shown as a rich result.&nbsp;In short, that means structured data might work as an implicit opt-in mechanism for publishers to get Google's rich results, even in case they might have been designated by Google as a European Journalistic Organization.Beyond traditional search: The importance of open dataThe team at WordLift has been advocating for the use of open data&nbsp;since its inception. At its core, open data enable machines to talk to each other, not only by enabling a clear understanding of the information provided on web pages. But also by empowering relationships among the data contained in these pages. Structured data, as they are fully accessible, making open data possible.Thus, granting access to machines of the data provided on a web property. That is why structured data become more and more important on the landscape of evolving search, where we move away from the traditional ten blue links, toward a richer navigational experience. Therefore, structured data become important not in its own sake, but as a tool that enables open data to become accessible to machines.What do you need to do next?Just to recap what we said so far.Google is enabling publishers to have more control on what to show in Google's rich results, by adding HTML tags and structured data on their pages. At the same time in light of a European Copyright Law Google is giving the options to European publishers to opt-out, so that is what you need to do: \tDon't do anything:&nbsp;If you haven't been designated by Google as a European Journalistic Organization. \tOpt-out: If you have been designated by Google&nbsp;as a European Journalistic Organization but you do want your content to be featured in Google's rich results. \tUse structured data:&nbsp;If you want to make sure to be automatically and implicitly opted-in by Google for its rich results. Thus, make sure to implement structured data on your pages!Key highlights \tGoogle is enabling publishers to have more control about the kind of information they pass as Google's rich results by using HTML tags. \tWhile these tags are important to assert more control on what or how much of the content from your pages can be extracted by Google. The update also highlights that as an alternative, and more powerful way to do so, there is structured data markup (Schema markup) which can be used as a more granular way to pass detailed information about web pages. \tAs France is among the first countries to roll out a European copyright law (so-called \"Link Tax\"), to cover itself from legal risks Google started to roll out an update also to other European countries. As the copyright law didn't specify what publishers could be designated to be opted out from Google extracting the content and repurposing it as rich results. The tech giant started to select a group of publishers as European Journalistic Organization. In short, where regular publishers automatically opt-in to Google rich results. European Journalistic Organizations need to explicitly opt-in to Google rich results. \tEuropean Journalistic Organizations can prevent this designation, either by explicitly opting-in to rich results, or by simply making sure to have structured data tags.&nbsp; \tThis update shows the growing importance of structured data for Google, in order to extract specific content for users. It also shows how search is becoming more divided. In short, as we go on the gap between the traditional index (with its ten blue links) and Google's rich results actually widens. And while the two are still connected today, we can imagine a day (not too far in the future) where the traditional index, won't talk anymore to the other index, that related to rich results.&nbsp;&nbsp; \tIn the new way of thinking about search, and discovery online, structured data as a tool that enables open data to thrive becomes a key component for machines and search engines to evolve. And with that publishers need to adapt. \tAnd a more political consideration. The web is a global phenomenon, there is no escape from that. A regulation issued by the EU has the potential to influence how Google works on a global scale.Audio update on Google's update from SEOisAEO podcastIn this episode recorded by Jason Barnard, on&nbsp;Google\u2019s Reaction to the Link Tax #SEOisAEO with Andrea Volpini at #colosSEOmeetup, there are a few key highlights from the latest updates, and what to do next if you're a publisher!Jason also recorded with us an incredible webinar that explains how Google rankings work (we're talking about the rankings that determine rich results).

Elocution\r\rKey takeaways and conclusions\r\rWhat is voice search and why it\u2019s booming in 2018\rVoice search, also known as Conversational Search, is a new kind of human-machine interaction where devices can answer human spoken questions. Conversational search analyzes a string of words and replies with responses which resemble our natural language.\r\rVoice search is now integrated into many devices such as mobile phones, home assistants like Amazon Echo and Google Home, and cars which support Intelligent Agents.\r\rToday this technology has four main players:\r\r \tAmazon, whose Alexa Voice Search uses Bing as a search engine\r \tApple, whose Siri is now using Google, after a long time using Bing\r \t Google, whose Google Voice Search, of course, relies on its own algorithms\r \tWindows, whose Cortana uses Bing \u2013 which is also owned by Microsoft \u2013 as a search engine.\r\rJust a few years ago, voice-activated technology sounded like science fiction, it reminded us of Star Trek\u2018s iconic characters commanding their computers with just their voices. Now it\u2019s 2018 and voice search is real and going to stay: 35.6 million Americans used a voice-activated assistant device at least once a month in 2017, estimates eMarketer \u2014 it\u2019s a year-over-year increase of 128.9 percent. We are facing the adoption of a fast-growing technology which will reshape the way we experience the web.\r\r\r\rAlpine.ai counts that, in 2018, there are over one billion voice searches per month and, according to ComScore, voice search will keep on growing, covering at least 50% of all searches by 2020.\r\rInternet users are finally massively using voice search for a variety of reasons:\r\r \tIt finally works! The error rate in speech recognition is getting close to zero. Andrew Ng has long predicted that as speech recognition goes from 95% accurate to 99% accurate, it will become the primary way that we interact with computers. This 4% accuracy gap is the difference between annoyingly unreliable and incredibly useful. Thanks to deep learning, we\u2019re finally cresting that peak.\r \tIt\u2019s fast and simple. Most people speak faster than they type. That\u2019s a fact. So, when you are in a hurry, it would be much easier to speak to a virtual assistant and get the answer you were looking for straight away. Also, when searching the web by typing a query you have to evaluate the results and pick the one that comes from the most relevant source (probably between those in the first SERP), if you are not satisfied with the results, you will have to narrow down your research by adding more keywords to the query. It requires some time and experience. Since virtual assistants are becoming more and more conversational, the voice search process is now simpler and more user-friendly: it resembles a natural conversation where the virtual assistant keeps track of previous questions and replies accordingly.\r \tIt\u2019s multitasking-friendly. Say you are at home cooking an apple pie and you just need to know how many eggs you need or you are driving to the venue of some event which is about to begin and you are not sure about the fastest route. In both cases, voice search can help by giving you the information you need while you are busy doing something else and without using your hands!\r \tIt\u2019s mobile-friendly. Anywhere, anytime, our virtual assistants are in our pockets, just a voice command away. Most times, thanks to instant answers, you don\u2019t even need to read something on your device, you just get the right answer\u2026 in zero time!\r\rWhat users need when using voice search is a quick and actionable answer: here is why, when it\u2019s possible, intelligent agents try to give an immediate answer skipping the websites. The bright side is that when your content is structured and rich, your articles and pages may be displayed as the instant answers by Intelligent Agents giving to you a boost in CTR.\r\rMoreover, voice searches are often longer and more contextualized than typed ones. When using a keyboard, users try to be specific enough and use as few words as possible, on the other hand, asking something to an intelligent agent, users tend to indulge in details related to their context. Content writers should prepare for voice searches by trying to be relevant to the long-tail of complex searches.\r\rThere is more. Smart speaker and conversational interfaces are perceived by users as shopping channels.\u00a0In a recent survey published by Bing, more than 40% of consumers state that they expect digital assistants to understand their purchase preferences and make routine purchases on their behalf within the next 5 years.\r\rThat's why according with Microsoft CEO, Satya Nadella: \u201cEvery brand will build intelligent conversational agents.\"\r\r[et_pb_section global_module=\"8794\"][/et_pb_section]\r\r\r\r\r\rFocus on: from keywords to semantics\rThe rise of voice search trend is just the tip of the iceberg: search engines are slightly moving from keywords to semantics and natural language processing is heading towards human-centric results. It\u2019s not just happening on voice search, it\u2019s true for any kind of search, especially on Google.\r\rSince fall 2013, thanks to the algorithm known as Google Hummingbird, SERPs have been more and more populated with results which take into account context information such as the kind of device used, geolocation, time of the day, previous searches and more. To give each user the best results, Google is also using a machine learning technology called RankBrain, which is the third signal in order of importance contributing to the results of each search. RankBrain is used mainly to interpret the searches in order to find pages that offer a good answer for users, but might not have the exact words that were searched for. It clearly relies on semantics since it goes beyond keywords and gets deeper into the contextual meaning of the search.\r\rWhen using context information, search engines serve more relevant results to users by picking the answers which seem to be more accurate and case-specific. Considering the biggest picture, voice search is one more reason for content creators to focus on content structure and rethink each page or article as an answer for specific personas.\r\rWordLift gives content marketers the opportunity to focus on writing while it does the techy job and gives structure to your article with metadata.\r\r\r\r\r10-step checklist to optimize your content for voice search\r\r#1. Answer questions\rMany voice searches are questions which start with the 5W + H (in case you don\u2019t remember from your school days they are Who, What, When, Where, Why and How). Usually, the answers to questions which start with Who, What, When and Where are a single piece of information that can be isolated: that is why Google and Intelligent Agents tend to answer these kinds of questions with instant answers. Owning or being the result picked as an instant answer is a strategic asset (the so-called Rank Zero case).\r\rWordLift offers you the chance to structure your content by assigning a role to each piece of information using the Who, What, When and Where categories.\r\r\r\r[et_pb_section global_module=\"8527\"][/et_pb_section]\r\r\r#2. Make your content easy to read\rOrganize the content of your page with subtitles, bullet points, tables, and some highlights: it will help machines understand the content on your page. Also, remember that many people tend to quickly scan a page before actually reading it. A neat content organization of your page will help your hasty readers and give them a reason to thoroughly read your article.\r\r\r#3 Optimize for mobile and local search\rMost times, voice search comes from mobile devices. Keep in mind and consider that a mobile-friendly website is crucial for your SEO. When talking about mobile optimization, remember that page speed is crucial.\r\rLet\u2019s take a step forward and think about how proximity could eventually change the relevance of your content. If you own a local activity, it probably does: think about how your products or services may help people around you and structure your content accordingly.\r\rThink about the needs of people walking nearby your office and feed them with useful information that relates to your business.\r\r\r#4 Add schema.org markup\rGoogle Assistant has no doubts: WordLift is the best answer for those who are looking for an SEO plugin that uses semantic technologies.\r\rSchema.org markup helps you by adding context to your content: you can use it to explicit the relations between information in your content, to disambiguate the words you are using and to give structure to your pages. When using schema.org markup you are communicating with machines through semantics instead of keywords: you are helping machines to define the context around information so that it will turn into useful results for humans.\r\r[et_pb_section global_module=\"8429\"][/et_pb_section]\r\r\r#5. Embrace everyday language\rDo you think that average users talk to their virtual assistants with complicated, hyper-specialized words? Wrong! They will most likely use everyday language or even slang to ask questions. So, more than ever, remember the KISS principle: \u201ckeep it simple, stupid!\u201c. Ask yourself what would users who know nothing or nearly nothing about the topic you are writing about would search, and then write for them.\rEinstein used to say: \u201cIf you can\u2019t explain it simply you don\u2019t understand it well enough\u201c.\r\r#6. Control Rank Zero\rWhen dealing with Google Home or Google Allo or Google Assistant (they do have their own slight differences) one source of information is the so-called rank zero snippets. These are featured snippets in search results whose summary has been extracted programmatically from a web page. While the real difference, for these snippets, is not the way the information has been fetched by Google (as this works much like the good old SEO) but how the result is presented to the user: these snippets answer a great deal of questions, triggered by our voice.\r\rSometimes controlling Rank Zero can be as simple as interacting with a site owner, share your product and get a review for it.\r\rHere are the steps I followed:\r\r \tLook for an easy-to-reach Rank Zero position that is relevant to your business. For example, I discovered a featured snippet for one of my favorite SEO tools by searching over Google \u201cWhat is WooRank?\u201d\r \tUnderstand where the information is coming from, in my case, the content on WooRank was extracted from a reviews\u2019 website called Reviews - Finances Online (they do a very good job)\r \tContact the website owner and ask for a review, just as I did for WordLift, our beloved WordPress plugin\r \tBoom! \u201cThat\u2019s right, man. I got in.\u201d - epic quote from the movie \u201cTron Legacy\u201d. The snippet was created within hours and this was a simple and easy way to train Google on what WordLift really is.\r\r\r\r\r#7. Curate Your Entity\rWhile Rank Zero results are driven by old SEO tactics, other snippets are driven by data that Google can truly understand and compute. This information is stored in the Google Knowledge Graph (eventually evolved in the Google Knowledge Vault). This is a large database organized much like our brain in a network of synapsis. These snippets, called knowledge panels, are bound to a Knowledge Graph ID, a unique identifier in the web of data that unambiguously maps the information related to a person, a company or a product. Just to give you an example my Knowledge Graph ID is kg:/m/0djtw2h. A simple query using this ID will show you everything that Google knows about me.\r\r\r\rThese types of results are way more powerful than the results generated using the Rank Zero snippets as they can be computed. The machine knows what it is talking about \u2013 it is not just repurposing information scraped from a webpage. The AI now has the data needed to discover other data and learn from it.\r\rHere are the steps in this case:\r\r \tLook for the Graph ID you need using the Knowledge Graph Search API (here is a good article to walk you though) \u2013 if you can\u2019t find it \u2013 give yourself a new target and build the data you need to get a Graph ID for your entity.\r \tEnsure that a consistent representation of the same entity is available in other digital spaces such as social networks, the universal encyclopedia, and your own website or blog.\r \tRemember to add your structured data markup (on all websites you can control) and a direct link to that Graph ID identifier. WordLift does this for you automatically and tells Google \u201cHey here we\u2019re talking about entity X and here you can find additional information to learn from\u201d. This is very a powerful technique for the so-called semantic search optimization.\r \tYou\u2019re done! Let the fun begin!\r\r\r#8. Teach Google the right Synonym\rThe explosion of online information has led to an impressive growth in quantity, diversity, and complexity of linguistic data accessible over the Internet. These resources become way more useful when they are linked to each other. Today\u2019s natural language interfaces and personal assistants leverage on this vast amount of information and benefit from the linked data paradigm. There are already incredibly useful lexical-semantic resources that AI tools and PAs can use by accessing linked data: WordNet, FrameNet as well as general knowledge graphs like DBpedia and Yago represent the foundation of today\u2019s computational linguistics. How can you take a spin at these technologies and improve the visibility of your brand?\r\rDiscover \u201cBauernherbst\u201d with Google Allo\r\rHere is an example that uses structured data markup to help Google Assistant promote a major festival in Salzbugerland, whose brand name is a German word (Bauernherbst), to an English speaking audience:\r\r \tstart with an entity (in this case an entity of type event that describes the harvest festival in the region of Salzburg)\r \tadd the synonym to the entity using the schema.org markup\r \tcreate the same entity (and the corresponding web page) in both German and English\r \tconnect the schema.org linked metadata of the German page with the schema.org metadata of the English page (and you can do all of this with WordLift without any technical skill)\r \tVoil\u00e0, magic happens!\r\r\r#9. Hijack your environment and let the PAs do the talking\rI remember the first time I saw the Google Glasses at SXSW Festival in 2013. The proud smile depicted on the faces of the very few lucky early adopters and how easy it was to kill their enthusiasm and annoy them to death without even talking to them. As soon as they would pass by with their head-mounted displays, someone nearby would shout\u2026 \u201cOK Google\u201d therefore activating the device and requesting them to press a button and stop the talking. We all know now, as Google Assistant has been shipped to all most recent Android devices, how frustrating it is when it gets activated by mistake.\r\rNow, what if\u2026 this is done with a purpose and within the context of an online advertising, a business talk or a presentation? This is what Burger King just did a few days ago to set the Internet on fire and to force Google to update all home devices and shut down the assistant-activated ad. Burger King\u2019s new 15-second commercial on YouTube triggers Google devices by shouting a voice search query within their promotional video\u2026 \u201cOk Google, what is the Whopper burger?\u201d. Sorry, I just loved that. There have been a lot of understandable complaints and yet, if used properly this is a game changer.\r\rhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InOmTxmq1Ik\r\rHere is how it goes:\r\r \tMake sure you can successfully have the PA talk about you or your preferred entity\r \tCreate a podcast or a video that engage the PAs in the room where your video is being watched\r \tAlways avoid being too invasive and remember privacy is important for everyone\r\r\r#10. Claim and Optimize your Business\rBeing successful in the Voice Search world is about strengthening your online presence, focusing on the user intents and making sure content, as well as data, \u00a0is consistent across the Internet. A lot of people use voice search to get information about local businesses. Sometimes it\u2019s quicker from a mobile device (if not absolutely mandatory \u2013 if you\u2019re driving) to ask your PA to make a call for you or to help you drive on time to a destination. These search queries rely on the accuracy of the business listings and on the consistency of a business\u2019 name, address and phone number (NAP).\r\rHello WordLift. Tap to Call.\r\rHere is what you need to do to help Google Assistant find your business:\r\r \tAdd it to Google My Business, Yelp and Bing Places for Business and remember to choose the right business category.\r \tIncorporate schema.org markup on your website to tell search engines: yes, this business has this website and yes, this is the business\u2019 name, address, and phone number. Schema markup helps PAs truly understand what your business is all about and reinforces the same data you should already have in the various directories.\r\r\r\r\r\rVoice ranking factors - a Backlinko study\rIn February 2018 Backlinko published a research study that collected and analyzed 10.000 Google Home results. The aim of the study was to better understand how Google Voice ranks works and, moreover, how to optimize a website for voice search.\r\rThey investigated the role of 11 ranking factors, and here is the summary of their work.\r\r \tPageSpeed is the king of voice search SEO. The average voice search result page loads in 4.6 seconds, which means that is 52% faster than the average page.\r \tHTTPS websites are crucial to appear within Google\u2019s voice search results. In fact, 70.4% of Google Home result pages are secured with HTTPS.\r \tLength: Google prefers short, concise answers to voice search queries. The typical voice search result is just 29 words long.\r \tSchema.org: 36.4% of voice search results come from pages that use Schema.org, slightly higher than the global average of 31.3%.\r \t Authoritative domains produce more voice search results than less authoritative ones. The average Ahrefs Domain Rating of a Google Home result is 76.8.\r \tSocial media: content with high levels of social engagement seems to perform well in voice search also. Just consider that the average voice search result has 1,199 Facebook shares and 44 Tweets.\r \tSimple, easy-to-read content may help with voice search SEO. The average Google voice search result is written at a 9th-grade level.\r \tTitle: we found that very few voice search results had the exact query in their title tag. This might mean that creating individual pages for each voice search query is not an effective voice search SEO strategy.\r \tWord count: on average, a voice search result page is made of 2,312 words. It may surprise you, but Google often sources voice search answers from long-form content.\r \tDesktop search: content that ranks high in desktop search is very likely to appear as a voice search answer. 75% of voice search results rank in the top 3 for that query.\r \tFeatured Snippet: 40.7% of all voice search answers come from a featured snippet. If your page is eligible for a featured snippet, it will likely appear on voice search.\r\r[et_pb_section global_module=\"8514\"][/et_pb_section]\r\r\r\r\rA schema.org property for speakable content\rRecently schema.org and Google have launched Speakable, a new property for web content that is still in beta and that may change the publishers\u2019 approach to voice search optimization.\r\r\rWhat is speakable?\rAccording with Google:\rThe speakable schema.org property identifies sections within an article or webpage that are best suited for audio playback using text-to-speech (TTS). Adding markup allows search engines and other applications to identify content to read aloud on Google Assistant-enabled devices using TTS. Webpages with speakable structured data can use the Google Assistant to distribute the content through new channels and reach a wider base of users.\rA the moment, this property only works for websites that are in English, other languages will be implemented soon.\r\r\rWhat content can be eligible for speakable structured data?\rContent from news sites is eligible to appear in news results and also to be read by Google Assistant. To validate your news site you can:\r\r \tsubmit it to Google through the Publisher Center\r \tset up a valid edition in Google News Producer.\r\rFind out how to implement speakable in your website with schema.org.\r\r\rWhat is PASO?\rThe acronym PASO stands for Personal Assistant Search Optimization, and it is referred to the use of SEO techniques with the aim of positioning content as the source of the answers given by Personal Assistants (PAs) such as Siri and Google Assistant to their users. The term was first introduced by John E. Lincoln in an editorial appeared on Search Engine Land and titled \u00abWhy the future is all about PASO \u2014 personal assistant search optimization\u00bb.\r\r\rWhy are personal assistants (PAs) going to shape the future of SEO?\r\r \tPersonal Assistants typically return only one result instead of the thousands of links we are used to in regular search. This means two things: competition is going to be really hard because it\u2019s first or nothing, and the winners will take all the clicks (and traffic).\r \tPersonal Assistants are used on smartphones and at home. They are portable, hands-free and incomparably convenient, especially when you are busy doing something else and you need a quick information to take action. Their use is going to grow very fast in the years to come: in fact, voice search is predicted to overcome regular search within 2020.\r \tPersonal Assistants are powered by Artificial Intelligence and they can give tailored results to their users, learning from factors such as localization and previous searches.\r\rSo, yes, PASO is definitely going to be something you should think about from now on.\r\rHere is a very immediate example of how this exact web page that you\u2019re reading has been indexed by Google and it is now providing the answer to the question.\r\rhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHmR7tPggI\r\r\rWhat are Google Actions?\rGoogle Actions are apps that extend the Google Assistant to help users get things done using their voice. Rather than by tapping on your phone as we normally do with apps, an Action lets us accomplish tasks mainly through our voice using a natural-sounding conversation.\r\rIn the last few months, Google has sold tens of millions of smart devices like the Google Home, Google Home Mini, and the Google Home Max at an incredible growth rate (one every second since last October according to Google).\r\rBy the end of 2018, the Google Assistant \u2014 which is already available in eight languages \u2014 will be available in more than 30 languages and will reach 95% of all eligible Android phones worldwide across multiple devices from Smart TVs to cars with Android Auto (yes, since January 2018, the Assistant is accessible behind the wheel of your favorite car).\r\rAt a time when it\u2019s harder and harder to grow your traffic organically over traditional social networks without spending a fortune on advertising, we\u2019re talking about a new entry point to your content for millions of users.\r\r\rHow Can I Make My Google Action Easy to Find?\rhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcFe0Rj2pW4&amp;t=1788s\r\r&nbsp;\r\rUsers need to invoke your Google Action through Google Assistant in order to engage with it. There are two main ways to make your Google Action accessible to users:\r\r \tExplicit invocation: This occurs when a user already knows the name of your Google Action and asks the Google Assistant to talk to it with something like \"Hey Google, talk to Sir Jason Link\" - a user, in this case, needs to know what it can ask your assistant. The Web Directory of Google Actions is a good place to start. Here is the page dedicated to Sir Jason Link.\r \tImplicit invocation: This is where the magic really happens. It's the way to engage with users that don't know yet about the existence of your app. As shown above, if a user will say something like \"Tell me something about Semantic SEO?\", Sir Jason Link might be invoked.\r\r\r\rIn the table above - taken from the Google Action Console of our app - we can see which phrases led to Google recommending our app.\r\rThe columns in the table above include:\r\r \tMatched spoken phrase: the user query that led to Google recommending your app.\r \tMatching action: the intent or action that the user\u2019s query was mapped to.\r \tImpression: this is the number of times the phrase led to Google recommending our app (it's similar to impressions in SERPs).\r \tSelection: the number of times a user invoked our app after Google recommended it. Imagine this as the equivalent of a user clicking on a SERP result.\r \tSelection rate: Probably the most important one in terms of optimization. This is the percentage of impressions that led to a selection. This metric would be the equivalent of a Click Through Rate on the result page.\r\rAs you can see from these results, Sir Jason Link received the highest number of impressions for an open intent call \u2014 $topic:topic \u2014 that basically deep links the request on single entities (whether these are companies like \"Google\" or a concept\u00a0such as \"Linked Data\").\r\rWhen the user triggered these keywords we got a significant amount of requests and for each of these requests, we had the content ready in our website (we do have entity pages for companies like Google and for concepts like \"linked data\").\r\rThe selection rate, of course, in this specific example, was not optimal.\r\r\rContent-based Actions\rIf you are a publisher and you produce constantly one specific kind of content such as news, podcasts, and recipes, you may be interested in optimizing your content in order to help Google automatically create Actions on the basis of your content. In this way, Google will generate a page on the Assistant directory.\r\rThen when Google Assistant users\u2019 intent will match with your content, Google will ask them if they are interested to listen at your news, podcasts, and recipes.\r\r \tNews. Once your news is part of the Assistant Directory, users will be able to access to your news articles as part of Google News - that includes top stories carousel and can massively improve your performance in traffic.\r \tPodcasts. Users will be able to find and listen to your podcasts, playing episodes on their devices directly from the Google Assistant.\r \tRecipes. Users can access your recipes starting from the rich card presented in the Google Assistant.\r\rIn other words, content-based actions will create a new access point to your website, driving more traffic to your content.\r\rWhat do you have to do to prepare your content to become a Google Actions? Follow the instructions below.\r\r\r#News\rIn order to index your news in the Assistant Directory and in Google News, your content has to meet these requirements:\r\r \tAssociate your content with Google News, following the official guide by Google.\r \tMark up your content for AMP, following this documentation.\r \tMark up your content as structured articles\rAccepted schema.org types for non-video news are: Article, NewsArticle, BlogPosting.\rHere are the schema.org properties that Google requires for news markup: author, author.name, datePublished, headline, image, publisher, publisher.logo, publisher.logo.height, publisher.logo.url, publisher.logo.width, publisher.name.\rModified date, description, and main entity are recommended, but not required.\rFor video news you should use the schema.org type VideoObject.\rHere are the schema.org properties that Google requires for video news markup: name, description, thumbnailUrl, publisher.name, publisher.logo, publisher.logo.url.\rDuration, content URL, embed URL, interaction count, and eventually expires (in case after a specific date the video won\u2019t be available anymore) are recommended, but not required.\r\r\r#Podcast\rIn order to index your podcast in the Assistant Directory, you have to follow these 4 steps:\r\r \tExpose a valid RSS feed describing the podcast, which conforms to the RSS 2.0 specifications. Google also asks for a few requirements:\rPodcast level\r&lt;title&gt; containing the name of the podcast\r&lt;link&gt; URL to the homepage of the podcast\r&lt;item&gt; listing the episodes of your podcast\rAuthor, image, description, and category are not mandatory, but surely the more your RSS feed is structured, the more easily Google will process your content and match it with users\u2019 searches. \rEpisode level\r&lt;title&gt; containing the title of the single episode of the podcast\r&lt;enclosure&gt; containing a URL of the audio file. These are the audio formats that Google accepts: aac, m4a, mp3, ogg, wav.\rDescription, GUID, publication date, and duration are the information you can also include to every single episode. \r \tAdd the at least one episode that conforms to the requirements above to your feed.\r \tCreate a homepage for your podcast. It has to describe what your podcast is about. Include this HTML element somewhere in the code:\r&lt;link type=\"application/rss+xml\" rel=\"alternate\" title=\"Your Podcast's Name\" href=\"Your podcast's RSS url\"/&gt;\rDon\u2019t place any other &lt;link type=\"application/rss+xml\" rel=\"alternate\"&gt; element on the page.\r \tNeedless to say, the homepage, the RSS feed, and any the single episodes of the podcast must be exposed to Googlebot. This means that they must not require a login, and must not be protected by robots.txt or &lt;noindex&gt; tags.\r\rExtra tip: the RSS specifications for Google Play Music and Google Search are complimentary - even if not identical - adding your podcast to Google Play may be worth the extra mile. Follow the instructions here.\r\r#Recipe\rRecipes are content about creating a specific dish. For example: \u201cpizza margherita\u201d is a valid name for a recipe, while \u201cfacial scrub\u201d is not.\r\rIn order to index your recipes in the Assistant Directory, you have to structure your content using the entity type Recipe.\r\rThe schema.org properties that Google requires for recipes mark-up are only two image, and name, but some of the extra properties can really make the difference.\r\rFor instance, recipeIngredient and recipeInstructions are required to allow the Google Home and Google Assistant to read the recipe and guide the users through the preparation of the dish. And\u2026 this is really what a key feature for people who are looking for a recipe!\r\rMore recommended properties are: aggregateRating, author, cookTime, prepTime, totalTime, datePublished, description, keywords, nutrition.calories, recipeCategory, recipeCuisine, recipeYield, review, video.\r\rYou can get deeper into content actions reading Google\u2019s guide.\r\r\rSpeech quality rating\rTo determine if the speech quality is acceptable, Google rates your content on the basis of three factors: length, formulation, and elocution. Learn what it means to improve your texts thinking about how the robotic voice of a personal assistant is going to pronounce them.\r\r\r\r\r#Lenght\rWas the response of an appropriate length matching the complexity of its content? Would it have been beneficial for the user if it were either more concise or more detailed?\r\r\r#Formulation\rWas it grammatical? Was the response formulated in a way you would expect a native speaker to formulate it? As opposed to a machine or someone not fully fluent in the language. When the answer included an attribution, was the source of the content clear and understandable?\r\r\r#Elocution\rHow accurate were the pronunciations of each word spoken in the response? Was the intonation of the voice natural throughout the response? Was the speed at which the response was spoken appropriately? This could be due to an awkward rhythm in the spoken response, or words slightly mispronounced.\r\r\rKey takeaways and conclusions\rThroughout this article, we saw that the voice search is here to stay. People are adopting it more and more often, and publishers have a unique chance to play into a new field of SEO, where the first result is really the one which counts.\r\rTo optimize your content for voice search you have to rethink your content in a more conversational way, trying to guess what a user would ask to a search engine or a personal assistant. Embracing the everyday language and switching to a conversational style is important, but it\u2019s just the beginning.\r\rYou have to keep strong attention to technical SEO matters, such as mobile optimization and schema.org markup.\r\rSchema.org markup is fundamental when it comes to Google Actions, the digital applications that the Google Assistant uses to answer to its users\u2019 search intents. Your content can automatically become a Google Action with the help of a proper schema.org markup.\r\rStructured content is the key to the new SEO strategies and it\u2019s a critical asset to be featured in voice search results, as well as featured snippets and Google Actions.\r\rWordLift makes content structuring through schema.org accessible by anyone without any technical skills. In other words, using WordLift you can optimize your content for voice search and create new access points leveraging on personal assistants.\r\r&nbsp;\r\r[et_pb_section global_module=\"8433\"][/et_pb_section]",

        "text": "How to find editorial opportunities starting from Google\u2019s PAA When you think about any potential topic you can write about, as an editor (or a content marketer) you know that you have to find the right angle to catch your reader\u2019s attention. It's not easy to guess what your readers are looking for, but the fact is that&nbsp;Google knows it better than you - and any content writer in the world.In this article, I want to share with you a method to find new editorial opportunities on a given topic and to understand which angle and subtopics have a chance to be showcased by Google into its PAA snippet.Finding editorial opportunities and approaching them from the right angle is one of the most difficult - and crucial - parts of the editorial work for publishers and content marketers. Google\u2019s related questions that appear in the rich snippet People Also Ask can be a useful tool to understand what matters to your target audience.What are users really looking for when they search for something on Google? What are the subtopics that matter most to Google around a specific topic? Follow me and you will understand how to figure it out for every single topic you are working on.Let\u2019s start with the basics.What is the PAA snippet?PAA, the acronym for People Also Ask and also known as Related Questions, is an accordion-like rich snippet that contains a selection of questions, which help Google\u2019s users to go in-depth a topic without even leaving the SERP. Each answer in the PAA snippet comes from a different source that Google considers authoritative about a specific subtopic.At first, you only see 4 different questions. As you start interacting with this snippet and click on the arrow to read one of the answers, you will notice that Google populates the snippet with an apparently never-ending list of new questions.This is the PAA that you can see on the SERP for family business, one of the main keywords for Tharawat MagazineActually, these questions may be a lot, but they are not infinite and, if you pay attention, you will notice that at a certain point questions become quite repetitive. In fact, there is a logic under these questions and they have a hierarchical organization.The first four questions are used to better understand the search intent and the choices of the searcher are used to deliver a secondary group of questions, which descend from the one that the user clicked.Why the PAA snippet matters to you?In a context where the 10 blue links are losing a lot of their visibility and traction, because they are leaving more and more space on the SERP to rich snippets, publishers and site owners need to find any spot to maximize the visibility of their content.The PAA snippet has a pervasive impact on Google\u2019s SERPs. Nowadays, Related Questions appear in 84.4% of the SERPS in the USA market (source: MozCast), this makes it the first rich snippet in terms of occurrences. It is far more common than the rich snippet (19,1% of the SERPs), and it grew more quickly in the last three years.Britney Muller, Featured Snippets: Essentials to Know &amp; How to Target on EvernoteWhat makes the PAA even more interesting from a publisher\u2019s standpoint is that a single PAA can show up in 21 unique SERPs (source: GetStat).In other words, if you get a spot on a PAA, you have your chance to be featured in different SERPs within the same semantic domain.Let\u2019s get back to the family business example. Google shows the same PAA when users are searching for the main keyword (\u2018family business\u2019) and also when they search for other related topics such as \u2018family business succession\u2019, \u2018family owned business success stories\u2019, and much more of them.This means that when your content is elected as a good answer by Google for its related questions, you will have great exposure and a serious boost in traffic.So, there are serious opportunities for your website ahead! ?Why Google is suggesting (all these) related questions?Search engines are eager for content to give users the best answers for different intents and needs. There was a time when Google\u2019s aim was to give the users a set of results in the form of blue links and bring them to other websites seamlessly.Then rich snippets entered the SERP and everything changed.Nowadays Google plays all its cards to keep the users on its SERP as much as possible. The accordion-like rich snippet known as People Also Ask is just another way to keep the user on the SERP and investigate on the intent of the search.So, basically, Google is trying to profile users by providing more context and guessing what they are more interested in around a specific topic. According to PageRanger, the initial 4 questions in a PAA target on average 2.8 different intents.How to extract and analyze the PAA snippet from a SERPAs a content writer, looking at the questions from the People Also Ask, you can guess how Google is connecting entities. This quick peek into Google\u2019s knowledge graph can give you a hint on: \twhat kind of angle you can adopt while writing on a specific topic \twhich related topics you can cover on your website to catch your target audience\u2019s attention \thow you can organize your content to optimize their visibility on the SERP.Before thinking about how to craft your editorial content to answer related questions, you need to extract your list of related questions. To this purpose, there are several tools that you can do.For example, the Italian SEO consultant Alessio Nittoli created a Pythonscript that scrapes Google PAAs giving you a list of questions in a CSV format. The code is available on GitHub.Keep in mind that scraping Google without permission is illegal, as Alessio states in his disclaimer:\u26a0 DISCLAIMER: This software is not authorized by Google and doesn\u2019t follow Google\u2019s robots.txt. Scraping without Google explicit written permission is a violation of their terms and conditions on scraping and can potentially cause a lawsuitThis software is provided as is, for educational purposes, to show how a crawler can be made to recursively parse Google\u2019s \u201cPeople also asked\u201d. Use at your own risk.When you have your list of related questions coming from the PAA snippet, you can move to the editorial strategy around your chosen content.How to spot and organize editorial opportunities from a list of \u2018People Also Asked\u2019 questionsSpot new content opportunitiesWhile analyzing the questions that come out your topic research through PAAs, you will notice that some questions are repeated frequently with slight variations that represent different intents. Other questions are logically connected: from generic concepts to more specific subtopics.Depending on how these questions are related and how much you can get in-depth, you can plan a new article about a concept and then add more specific subtopics as paragraphs, or you can write a page about a concept or an entity and then write an article to cover each specific subtopic.Here in WordLift, we adopt this latest model, that we have named the Entity Based Content Model: it develops around an entity and explores the relations that connect it to specific subtopics and to other entities.Rearrange and organize your contentIf you have been writing around a specific and narrow topic for a while, chances are that the content that answers the questions can already be on your website - but it may need to be rearranged. For example, you can add new headlines and paragraphs to highlight your answers and make them stand out of the content. A good practice could be to build an FAQ page.Wrapping things upGoogle PAAs are becoming so much pervasive, that if you get your spot on the Google PAA of your main keyword (and on some related long-tail keywords), you\u2019ll get the chance to have a great boost in visibility and clicks.Once you extract the related questions, you can use them to enrich, refine and improve your editorial plan and to optimize existing content.In WordLift, we are using the Entity Based Content Model to organize different pieces of content around a specific topic and offer to search engines and readers what they need to know.If you want to know how to apply this model to your website content and to your niche, write us a few lines about your editorial project and let\u2019s talk!",

        "text": "What Is Google Discover And Why It Matters If You Are A Publisher If you are a publisher you might have noticed that in 2019 Google introduced a new report called Discover. With the WordLift team, we\u2019ve been looking into that to understand the dynamics of Google Discover for our VIP clients.And in this article, I\u2019m showing you the latest findings, what is Google Discover, and why it matters so much if you are in the publishing business (or if content marketing is your primary acquisition channel).While it might have passed unnoticed for many, Google Discover has become a critical source of traffic for many others.Let\u2019s start from understanding what\u2019s Google Discover and why it matters so much.What is Google Discover?As Google specified when it launched it back in April 2019:Discover is a popular way for users to stay up-to-date on all their favorite topics, even when they\u2019re not searching. To provide publishers and sites visibility into their Discover traffic.As highlighted in the launch of Google Discover there are two key elements to take into account when analyzing Google Discover:Google wants users to stay up-to-date.It also wants to provide recommendations when they are not searching.Therefore, Discover is a mechanism that enables users to find the most relevant content, in a specific timeframe, on their mobile device.This is a revolution as it enables Google to move from pure search (where users need to type in keywords to retrieve information on the web) to a discovery mechanism where people can find effortlessly what they look for.Why didn\u2019t Google offer Discover way before?For Google to make this step, in a scalable manner, it needed to develop two things: a database capable to hold a massive amount of information. And a powerful AI to be able to query this database to provide relevant information to users.In 2019, both those technologies were finally available (at least for Google). The massive database is called a Knowledge Graph (Google has been building it since 2012).And the AI able to query that database is now at the core of Google strategy (Google converted into an AI-first company already back in 2017).Discover is a massive distribution platformIf you don\u2019t think Google Discover is worth your attention, Google disclosed the platform has already more than 800 million users (as of April 2019).In other words, if you were to master Google Discover you would enable your publishing business to double its reach in a relatively short timeframe (we\u2019ve seen publishers doubling their Discover traffic in a few months).So how do you do that? In the checklist below, Andrea Volpini has highlighted the key elements to take into account when optimizing for Google Discover: \tCreate an entity in the Google Knowledge Graph  \tFocus on high-quality content and a great user experience  \tRespond to a specific information need  \tAlways use an appealing hi-res image and a great titleI want you now to focus on the mindset you need to be able to grasp the opportunities around Google Discover.Google Discover is also a new analytical tool which can help you unlock new insightsAs Google launched Discover on the one hand. On the other hand, it also made visible to website owners a new report (with the same name) which enables them to look at the traffic coming from its Discover platform.As Google specified:We're adding a new report in Google Search Console to share relevant statistics and help answer questions such as: \tHow often is my site shown in users' Discover? How large is my traffic? \tWhich pieces of content perform well in Discover? \tHow does my content perform differently in Discover compared to traditional search results?By looking at Discover you\u2019ll find out a few important aspects: \tDiscover works more in a boom and bust cycle. It makes sense as Discover moves away from traditional search, as Google will be pushing your content on Discover if it is relevant at that moment for users that expressed interest on those topics. \tYou will notice also evergreen content entering Discover if it is interesting in the short term as there are more people searching for that topic. \tIf you speed up the creation of a shorter form of content as a companion for longer, potentially evergreen content (I\u2019ll explain that in a second) you will improve your chances to be featured in Discover.Understanding Discover: beyond searchGoogle Discover delivers a mixture of information based on users\u2019 interests, coupled with what is trending and what Google believes is relevant for these users.In short, Google wants to offer the most relevant content available for that user at that moment.This requires even a better understanding of your audience, which goes well beyond keywords alone.For instance, with the WordLift team we put together a Semantic Dashboard which pulls up information based on the topics that your audience finds most interesting:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mr5mXBV028As you will notice from the video there are no keywords in this dashboard, as most of it is done by analyzing cluster of content, that in the Semantic Web jargon are called Entities. Therefore, the Semantic Analytics Dashboard will tell you what cluster of contents is actually providing traction to a broader concept.It is important to highlight that Entities go well beyond keywords, because they represent concepts which are taken from a context, and disambiguated (clarified) to the search engines through structured data in the form of Schema Markup.When you optimize your content. But also when you do the research to understand what kind of content to write about you want to look at all the key topics your audience has been looking at.Thus, rather than just optimize for a single keyword you can structure your content by looking at the concepts to cover. This is important as you won\u2019t see the optimization process as a one-time thing.And this mindset will push you to create formats that are interesting for your audience. And that can be systematized for more efficient creation of content.But wow do you understand what content goes into Discover?Shorter-form vs. long-form content?In the SEO community, there is a lot of discussion around the topic of short vs. longer-form content. The reality is that discussion doesn't even matter and it completely misses the point.A shorter or longer-form content will depend upon the search intent (another buzzword in the SEO world). In simple terms, if I\u2019m asking \u201cwhat is Google Discover\u201d my intent might be purely informational.Which makes me want to understand the topic at a more in-depth level, thus a longer piece might work. However, also for people searching for such a query, a good chunk of them might just want a simple, straight answer. Thus, they might look for the definition and then leave the article.Thus, there isn\u2019t a universal answer for that (it\u2019s like asking to a what\u2019s the perfect size of a screwdriver to an electrician!) and it doesn\u2019t even matter!Clarified this point, let\u2019s move forward.Short-term format as a companion for longer, evergreen contentGoing back to Google Discover. If your site primarily publishes more in-depth pieces of content that are more suited for an audience which is looking for evergreen content, relevant in years to come you will might able to capture ongoing organic traffic as there always be an audience looking for that.On the other hand, it also makes sense to create a short-term format that provides valuable information to your audience.Thus, if you\u2019re publishing \u201cthe ultimate guide to selling on Amazon\u201d you might also want to have a format where each week you present a case study. That case study might be structured around what your audience is searching for in the last month or so.In this way, you can enhance your chances to be featured in Google Discover.Update your content frequentlyAs you know Google likes fresh content.Oops sorry, I fell into the expert fallacy again!It\u2019s not Google that likes fresh content, people like it.If Google were to serve an article about what\u2019s the best restaurant in town, which is dated to 2017 that might be very disappointing for the user to find out that the restaurant doesn\u2019t exist anymore.Therefore, if you have pieces that might be come less relevant as they provide outdated information. Make sure to update them, change the publication date to signal Google that you made important changes to the article and index that again.In this way, we facilitate the work for Google, which might serve it again, or keep serving it on Discover if it sees that content is still relevant for an audience.With the WordLift team, we noticed is that Google might also offer it several times to the same Discover users. But in order to keep that content interesting for the Discover platform you need to make sure to update it with fresh information over time.Ask your audience to add you as a source on DiscoverWithin Discover, users can decide what topics to follow, and what sources to include. Let your audience know they can add your publication as a source, so it becomes easier to be notified when relevant pieces are out.This will give you more traction on the existing audience, and also presumably improve your authority within Discover. I don\u2019t have any data to back that up, but it makes sense to me that if more people are adding you as a source within Discover, the more that might signal to Google that you are relevant on that vertical.Build your knowledge graphA Knowledge Graph is a semantic representation of your website. I like to call it a \u201cmodern sitemap or a sitemap of meanings.\u201dWe\u2019ve been helping since 2017 companies of any size building their knowledge graphs. With tools like WordLift that becomes extremely easy as we use natural language processing to match your content with what can potentially become an entity, thus giving you the chance to enrich semantically your content. Thus making it easier for Google to discover it, and offer it in several formats (be it a regular search, an advanced feature like a position zero, or inside Google Discover).Key takeawaysGoogle Discover is a new content distribution platform for publishers, and a new way to find relevant content for users.\u00a0It is slightly different from the way Google as always worked for two primary reasons. One, Discover enables users to find up to date, and relevant information on a feed rather than a search result page. Second, Google Discover moves away from the search logic, as it pushes content to users without them even looking for it.\u00a0In addition, Google Discover is also a new report within the Google Search Console which gives insights to publishers about the kind of content that Discover users consume.\u00a0That makes available to publisher a new massive distribution platform, and it creates new untapped opportunities if you take the time to implement the framework and checklist provided in this article.Search is changing from push to pull, from information retrial to content recommendation, and Google Discover clearly shows it.

When we write, in order to be relevant for our audience and following the introduction of Hummingbird, we need to focus on topical hubs.\r\rTo truly optimize your site for Google\u2019s new semantic understanding of the user queries we have to think in terms of entities and not just keywords.\r\rMoreover, we have to consider:\r\r \tthe connections between entities and\r \thow these relationships help us build the context for the content that we are producing\r\rTo help you make this switch from keywords to entities we have created a tool that helps you track your rankings using the entities in the vocabulary of your website.\r\rHere is how it works:\r\rThe Keywords configuration panel\r\rYou get to choose the keywords that matter the most for your business (or the top 200 keywords the site ranks for) and WordLift will track the rankings on a daily basis across the entire site.\r\rThe Search Rankings widget on this blog\r\rUnder Search Rankings, you will find the entities that are driving the organic traffic on your website (the larger the tile and the more the concept is standing out on Google).\r\rThis data helps you immediately see if you are connecting with the right audience. Instead of scanning hundreds (or even thousands) of combinations of keywords and pages,\u00a0in one single treemap, you can see what entities matter the most.

        "text": "Machine Learning For Seo: How To Improve Seo With AI Does SEO use machine learning?In this post, I\u2019ll walk through the analysis of&nbsp;Google Search Console data combined with a machine learning clustering technique to provide an indication of what pages can be optimized to improve the organic traffic of a company website. I will also highlight the lessons I learned while using machine learning for an SEO task.Interestingly, website owners when I propose to use their data are usually very relieved that AI can take care of the mundane, repetitive SEO work like analyzing GSC data; this allows the clients of our SEO management service and our own team, to focus on more complex, value-adding work such as content writing, content enrichment, and monetization.How does machine learning work?This experiment is designed for anyone: no specific coding skill is required. A good grip on Google Sheets is more than enough to get you started in the data mining of your website\u2019s GSC data.We will use Orange, an open-source tool built on top of Python, for data mining and analysis that uses a visual programming front-end (a graphical user interface that lets you do what a developer would do using a Jupyter notebook environment and Python, yay!).You can install Orange from Anaconda, a popular Python data science platform, or simply download it and install it from their website. We will also use data from a web crawler to extract information about the length of the title and the length of the meta description. This can be done using a WooRank account, Sitebulb or any other web crawler of your choosing. &nbsp;What is machine learning in SEO?Dealing with machine learning is indeed a paradigm shift. The basic idea is that we provide highly curated data to a machine and the machine will learn from this data, it will program itself and it will help us in the analysis by either grouping data points, making predictions or extracting relevant patterns from our dataset. Choosing the data points and curating the dataset, in machine learning, is as strategic as writing the computer program in traditional computer science. By deciding the type of data you will feed the machine you are transferring the knowledge required to train the machine. To do so, you need the so-called domain experts and when I started with this experiment I came across a tweet from Bill Slawski that indicated to me the importance of comparing search impressions to clicks on a page as the most valuable piece of data from the Google Search Console.A3 One of my favorite GSC Data points is comparing search impressions to click on a page, if they vary widely is a sign that rewriting titles or snippets would be a good idea - less of a sign of success of an ongoing campaign, but helpful to know about. #SEOChat\u2014 Bill Slawski \u2693 (@bill_slawski) January 10, 2019 I also spotted another valuable conversation on the topic between Aleyda Solis and Cyrus Shepard.+1000 ?I especially enjoy revising/reoptimizing titles and meta descriptions from time to time, starting with those pages that are now in the top 3-5 positions but very low CTR. https://t.co/RElxn7jSiC\u2014 Aleyda Solis ??\u200d? (@aleyda) January 23, 2019 By reading this I decided to compile a dataset composed of the following attributes. The first 6 coming from GSC and the other 2 coming out of the crawling of the pages.The overall idea, as explained by Bill Slawski, is to rewrite the title and the meta description of pages that receive a good number of impression and a low number of clicks.\u201cWilling to know more about what data is provided by Google Search Console? Read it all here on the WooRank\u2019s Blog.\u201dAs we learned from Aleyda another important aspect to winning the game is to focus only on pages that have already a strong position (between 3 and 5 she says). This is extremely important, as it will speed up the process and bring almost immediate results. Of course, the bracket might be different for smaller websites (in some cases working with pages with a position between 3 and 10 might also be valuable).How do I get the data from Google Search Console into Google Sheet?Luckily GSC provides fast and reliable access to your data via APIs, and you can use a Google Sheet Add On called searchanalyticsforsheets.com that automatically retrieve the data and stores it in Google Sheet without writing a line of code. It is free, super simple to use and well documented (kudos for the developing team ?). If you are more familiar with Python you can also use this script by Stephan Solomonidis on GitHub that would do pretty much the same work with only a few lines of code. In my dataset, I wanted to have both queries and pages in the same file. A page usually ranks for multiple intents and it is important to see what is the main query we want to optimize for. How can I merge two datasets in one?Aggregating data from the crawler with data from GSC can be done directly in Orange using the merge data widget that horizontally combines two datasets by using the page as a matching attribute. I used, instead, Google Sheets with a combination of ARRAYFORMULA (it will run the function on an entire column) and VLOOKUP (this does the actual match and brings both title length and meta description length in the same table). &nbsp;=ARRAYFORMULA(VLOOKUP(A2:A,crawl_html!A6:C501,{1,2},false))ARRAYFORMULA(VLOOKUP(search_key,range,index,[is_sorted]))search_key (the attribute used in the matching)range (the sheet with the data from the crawler)index (the columns from the crawler dataset that we want to import &nbsp;for the length of the title and of the meta description) &nbsp;&nbsp;is_sorted (typically set to FALSE since the two tables we\u2019re merging don\u2019t follow the same order)How to prepare data for machine learningData curation is essential to obtain any valid results with artificial intelligence. Data preparation also is different for each algorithm. Each machine learning algorithm requires data to be formatted in a very specific way and before finding the right combination of columns and yield useful insights I did several iterations. Missing data and wrong formatting (when migrating data in Orange in our case) have been issues to deal with. Generally speaking for missing data there are two options, either remove the data points or fill it up with average values (there are a lot more options to consider but this is basically what I did in the various iterations). Formatting is quite straightforward, we simply want Orange to properly see each informative feature as a number (and not as a string). How to create a dataset for machine learningThe dataset we\u2019re working with is made of 15784 rows each one containing a specific combination of page and query. We have 3 informative features in the dataset (clicks, impression, and position) and 5 labels (page, query, CTR, title and meta description length). Page and query are categorical labels (we can group the data by the same query or by the same page). CTR is a formula that calculates clicks/impression * 100 and for this reason, is not an informative feature. Labels or calculated values are not informative: they don\u2019t help the algorithm in clustering the data. At the same time, they are extremely useful to help us understand and read the patterns in the data. &nbsp;Dataset configuration in OrangeWhat is k-Means Clustering algorithm in machine learning?When looking at thousands of combinations of queries across hundreds of web pages selecting the pages that have the highest potential in terms of SEO optimization is an intimidating task. This is particularly true when you have never done such analysis before or when you are approaching a website that you don\u2019t know (as we do - in most cases - when we start a project with one new client that is using our technology).We want to be able to group the combination of pages that can be more easily improved by updating the title and the snippet that describes the article. We also want to learn something new from the data that we collected to improve the overall quality of the content that we will produce in the future. Clustering is a good approach as it will break down the opportunities in a limited number of groups and it will unveil the underlying patterns in the data. A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together by a certain degree of similarity.How does k-Means Clustering work?K-Means clustering is one of the simplest and most popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms. It will make inferences using only input features (data points like the numbers of impressions or the number of clicks) without requiring any labelled outcome. K-Means will average the data by identifying a centroid for each group and by grouping all records in a limited number of clusters. A centroid is the imaginary centre of each cluster. &nbsp;How do I create a workflow in Orange?Here is how the flow looks like in Orange. We\u2019re importing the CSV data that we have created using the File widget, we\u2019re quickly analyzing the data using the Distribution Widget. We have the k-Means Widget at the centre of the workflow that receives data from the Select Rows Widget (this is a simple filter to work only on records that are positioned in SERP between 3 and 10) and sends the output to a Scatter Plot that will help us visualize the clusters and understand the underlying patterns. On another end, the k-Means sends the data to a Data Table widget that will produce the final report with the list of pages we need to work on and their respective queries. Here we also use a Select Rows widget to bring in our final report only the most relevant cluster. &nbsp;The data analysis pipeline in OrangeHere is how the distribution of rankings looks like.The silhouette score in k-Means helps us understand how similar each combination is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation).The silhouette score ranges from 0 to 1 (a high value indicates that the object is well matched to its own cluster). By using this value the algorithm can define how many clusters we need (unless we specify otherwise) and the level of cohesion of each group. In our case 3 clusters represent the best way to organize our data and to prioritize our work. From the initial 15784 samples (the rows in our dataset) we have now selected 1010 instances (these are all the combinations with pages in position 3-10) that have been grouped by k-Means. &nbsp;&nbsp;k-Means configuration parametersHow is machine learning used in Google Search?We will use Orange\u2019s intelligent data visualization to find informative projections. In this way, we can see how the data has been clustered. The projections are a list of attribute pairs by average classification accuracy score that shows us the underlying patterns in our dataset. Here are the top 4 I have chosen to evaluate.1. Focus on high impressions and low CTR and here is the list of pages to optimizeScatter Plot #1 -&nbsp;CTR vs Impressions&nbsp;&nbsp;(the size of the symbols indicates the CTR)There is no point in working on cluster C1, either there are very few impressions or the CTR is already high. Where it hurts the most is on C3 and following we have the C2 cluster. We have now a total of 56 combinations of pages and queries that really deserve our attention (C2 and C3). Out of this batch, there are 18 instances in C3 (the most relevant group to address) and this basically means working on 16 pages (2 pages are getting traffic from 2 queries each).The final report with the pages to work onThis is the list for our content team to optimize. New titles and improved meta descriptions will yield better results in a few weeks.2. Positions don\u2019t matter as much as impressionsScatter Plot #2 -&nbsp;Positions vs ImpressionsOur three clusters are well distributed across all selected positions. We might prefer - unless there are strategic reasons to do otherwise - to improve the CTR of a page with a lower position but a strong exposure rather than improving the clicks on a higher ranking result on a low volume keyword. 3. Write titles with a length between 40 and 80 characters Google usually displays the first 50\u201360 characters of a title tag. MOZ research suggests that you can expect about 90% of your titles to display properly when contained under 60 characters. From the data, we gathered we could see that, while the vast majority is working under 60 characters we can still get a healthy CTR with titles up to 78 characters and not shorter than 38 characters. &nbsp;&nbsp;Scatter Plot #3 -&nbsp;CTR vs Title Length4. Write Meta Description with a length between 140 and 160 charactersAt the beginning of May last year, the length of the meta description on Google has been shortened after the last update in December 2017, when the length was extended up to 290 characters. In other words, Google is still testing various lengths and if on a desktop it displays 920 pixels (158 characters) on mobile you will see up to 120 characters in most cases. &nbsp;&nbsp;Meta description length in 2019 according to blog.spotibo.comThis means that the correct length is also dependent on the percentage of mobile users currently accessing the website. Once again we can ask the data what should be the preferred number of characters by looking at clusters C2 and C3. Here we can immediately see that the winning length is between 140 and 160 chars (highest CTR = bigger size of the shapes). &nbsp;&nbsp;Scatter Plot #4 -&nbsp;CTR vs Meta Description Length[et_pb_section global_module=\"10045\"][/et_pb_section]What can I do with Machine Learning?

We had been proud to attend these two days full of events and to report on the latest news from Berlin...well, we decided to let the AI write this blog post ?\rDisclaimer: this content has been generated by an AI and we are very thankful to the (human) folks working at the following companies for contributing to this languange model: wptavern.com, codeinwp.com, themeum.com, getshifter.io, torquemag.io and wpblog.com.\rQuestions are from ourselves while answers are AI-written.\rWhat is WordCamp Europe 2019?\rIt\u2019s the WordCamp in Europe. WordCamp 2019 is being held in Berlin, the capital of Germany. If you\u2019re not a local, though, you\u2019ll have to spend a lot of your hard earned money to attend the WCEU!\rWhat is the biggest update on Gutenberg?\rBiggest news on Gutenberg right now is the experimental block editor.\rMatt Mullenweg\u00a0took the stage at\u00a0WordCamp Europe\u00a0in Berlin for sharing the latest update on WordPress. Can you tell us something about it?\rMatt talked about how Gutenberg\u2019s block editor has added a host of notable improvements, including block management capabilities, a cover block with nested elements, widgets as blocks, block grouping, and snackbar style notices.\r\rMullenweg also highlighted a few beautiful and innovative examples of Gutenberg in the wild. Two projects from Human Made showcase Gutenberg-powered designs (artefactgroup.com) and an AI integration that analyzes a user\u2019s writing in the editor (ingenuity.siemens.com.)\u00a0\r\rMatteoc and Cyberandy took stage at WCEU\rGoogle is increasing its engagement in the WordPress ecosystem and for this edition of WCEU they\u00a0introduced a new tool called Google Site Kit. What is it?\rSimple, Site Kit is a new addition to Google\u2019s WordPress plugin lineup that was announced at WordCamp US. It provides a dashboard that displays how well a site is doing with various Google tools, such as Search Console, Analytics, AdSense, and PageSpeed Insights, packaged as a one-stop solution.\rWe firmly believe WordPress should become more democratic in the way decisions are taken. What\u00a0Mullenweg\u00a0had to say about it?\rOne attendee asked if WordPress.org plans to implement a more democratic structure for decision making. Mullenweg seemed to interpret the question as referencing a system where tens or hundreds of millions of WordPress users would participate in making decisions on features through a vote or some other form of feedback. In contrast, he said WordPress\u2019 current approach is for leadership to try to get a sense for what the most common issues are through polls and public channels and allow those issues to help shape the project\u2019s roadmap.\r\r\rWhat is a WordCamp, by the way?\rStrictly speaking, WordCamps are conferences where WordPress experts are invited to talk about different aspects of the most popular CMS. Among the panel of speakers, you\u2019ll find WordPress developers, bloggers, security experts and anyone who can deliver value to the attendees.\r\rThe biggest WordCamps are undoubtedly WordCamp Europe and WordCamp US. An approximate 4000 people attended the WordCamp US 2018 in Nashville.\r\rAkin to WordPress\u2019 open source nature, WordCamps are open to anyone with a ticket. However, the bigger the WordCamp, the more expensive the tickets are thanks to a panel of highly popular WordPress personnel speaking at the event.\r\rFourWeeksMBA at WCEU 2019\r\r[et_pb_section global_module=\"10845\"][/et_pb_section]",

        "text": "Advanced SEO Strategies using Natural Language Processing In this article, I will share some of the ways natural language processing and the combination of semantic web technologies and machine-learning can help you outsmart your competitors and gain a true SEO advantage.\rWe hear a lot about AI these days and what it can do to help business, social networks and large organizations improve their competitiveness. In this article, I will focus on how AI-powered SEO can be used to help publishers increase the level of engagement of their readership and boost the findability of their content.\rHow are search engines using Natural Language Processing?\rSearch engines are becoming capable of better understanding the intents of the searchers thanks to the continuous advancements of their linguistic AI capabilities.\r\r\r\rFrom detecting synonyms to disambiguating previously unseen queries with the help of named entity recognition, part of speech tagging, named entity disambiguation and sentiment analysis, natural language processing, the research fields that focus on transforming natural language into machine-computable information, is playing a central role in the way commercial search engines like Google and Bing as well as personal digital assistants, process our requests, index websites and find relevant content on the Web.\r\rWhile in the past search engines like Google worked with statistical models built around keywords and links, we're now seeing semantic graphs and machine learning algorithms deeply influencing the quality of the results as well as the way these results are presented to the end-user.\r\rFrom voice responses to featured snippets, from interactive widgets like the news carousel to zero-results SERP.\r\rTry asking the Google Assistant \"What is Semantic SEO?\" and you will see the implication of an AI-first ecosystem where machines are trained with semantically-rich data to be able to answer using natural language rather than with a set of blue links.\r\r\r\rNow that we've looked briefly at the evolution of search engines let's move our attention to the other side of the coin: the content being published.\rHow can NLP help improve SEO?\rNLP and semantic annotations help content being understood by machines. Adding semantic processing in a publishing workflow means using natural language processing to add a layer of semantically structured information that describes your content.\r\rThere are a number of ways that NLP is used today to improve SEO and user engagement. I will walk you through few use cases and some leading examples of advanced SEO strategies.\r1. Structured Data Markup Automation\r#NLP can be used to classify your content and to publish structured data markup that describes your content. ? This will help search engines index your website more effectively. #SemanticSEO ?  Click To Tweet\r\rHere at WordLift, we call this method structured data markup automation. You can use tools like the Redlink Semantic Platform, Alchemy from IBM or the APIs of Bing to extract entities. These entities, and their unique identifiers, can be used to describe your content to search engines and... yes, this is exactly what WordLift does ? and you can see it in action on websites with millions of visitors such as thenextweb.com, windowsreport.com as well as established publishers like Reuters or the BBC.\r\rSee an example of JSON-LD's\u00a0Linked Data from the article where The Next Web describes how they are using schema.org markup\rIs structured data really helping website traffic grow?\rJust recently Google shared three business cases to promote the usage of structured data and to educate webmasters in improving the quality of their schema.org markup. Results can be astonishing. See Eventbrite's case study: their website experienced a 100% growth in organic traffic from Google Search to event listing pages.\r\"Within two or three weeks we started seeing a visual difference in our event search results on Google,\" Allen Jilo, an Eventbrite product manager, says. \"The Google Search experience definitely helps drive more eyeballs to event pages. And when those people convert, it translates to incremental ticket sales for our event creators.\"\r\r2. Internal link building and content discovery\rIn-links help users discover content from your website and they also help search engines evaluate what your content is about and how effective the user experience can be for a user that arrives for the first time on a particular webpage. A strong logical internal linking structure helps your SEO significantly.\r\r[et_pb_section global_module=\"8332\"][/et_pb_section]\r\rWith NLP and entity extraction algorithms, you can see what concepts can be detected by a machine. These algorithms are trained using machine learning techniques on large semantical databases extracted from Wikipedia or other openly available corpora of text. By looking at the list of extracted entities you, as a writer, might decide that your article deserves a contextual background and an introduction to some of the concepts that the NLP detected; this will help the reader (as well as search crawlers) understand \"things\" that they might not otherwise understand in-depth.\r\rJust to give you an idea 10% of the searches that we make daily are meant to help us better understand things that we don't know well. These searches usually are directed to Wikipedia or can be answered directly by the search engine with its knowledge graph panels. With NLP you can provide immediately this information to the reader without having him or her jump somewhere else.\r\rWe see a lot of these examples where NLP is used to create in-links that matter to the reader. Look for example at how The Guardian is using it in its articles to connect articles around \"Russia\" and \"Vladimir Putin\".\r\r\r3. Content recommendation\rWhen content is annotated using natural language processing, the metadata is stored in a machine-readable format like JSON-LD, Microdata or RDF. Machine Learning is good at classifying information and predicting for instance, what the user will like to read next.\r\rContent recommendations greatly improve what SEOs called dwell time, the time that users spend on a website between the click on a search result and the return back to the SERP.\r\rThe more the recommendations are good the more readers remain engaged with the content.\r\rAdding a semantic layer of metadata to the content greatly improves the machine learning models that we can build to help the user jump from one article to another.\r\rA great work in this area has been done by PoolParty and here you can find an interesting presentation on their Semantic Classifier and how it can help you create content recommendations that combine semantic enrichments produced by NLP with neuronal networks. The intersection between NLP, Semantic Graphs, and Machine Learning is also referred to as Semantic AI.\r\r\r4. Smart redirections and 404s handling\rThis is a fairly narrow and yet very powerful mechanism that allows a website, like Quora, that is built around topics to route the user to the right topic by intercepting all the alternative names a concept might have.\rYou can see it in action by directing your browser to a topic page like this:\rhttps://www.quora.com/topic/seo\r\r\rYou will notice that your browser automatically redirects the request to the topic page for Search Engine Optimization located at the URL:\rhttps://www.quora.com/topic/Search-Engine-Optimization-2\rThe web server of Quora has been configured to understand that \"SEO\" is equivalent for \"Search Engine Optimization\" and this is done by de-referencing the entity Search Engine Optimization in public knowledge graphs like DBpedia where all the synonyms for a given concept are described.\r\rIn other words for every topic page, by de-referencing each concept with the equivalent entity in large linguistic graphs, Quora is able to configure multiple 301 redirects to intercepts requests without having to worry about how each user is calling a specific concept. Yes, this configuration can be also easily implemented via WordLift ? when entities are detected by the NLP, WordLift de-reference them using Wikidata, DBpedia, Yago and other large semantic graphs.\r5. Topic targeting\rIn recent years the attention has moved - at least for some SEO Experts - from targeting keywords to targeting topic clusters. As search engines are more capable of understanding the world around us and disambiguation comes into play the same results can be presented to the user across multiple searches that share the same intent; the competition is no longer on targeting a specific keyword but rather becomes about being relevant for a specific topic.\r\rRelevancy, practically speaking, is achieved by expanding a topic in all the directions that might be of interest to our user.\r\rWith linguistic AI and word-vectors, we can start exploring a concept to see how it is semantically related to other concepts. This can guide us in building the proper context around it - there is a very interesting experiment we did to optimize Title tag SEO using TensorFlow that you should read to learn more about this technique.\rIf you want to start immediately playing with Word Vector I also suggest you spend some time playing with Google Semantris. You will see what machine learning can do when applied to semantics.\r6. SERP Analysis with NLP\rWhen you start analyzing multiple keywords and how they behave over time you basically look at the top 10 or 20 results for each keyword and how Google ranks the content behind each website. As keywords to track increase it becomes extremely complex to understand the trends behind all these web pages.\r\rBack in 2013, as we were doing agency work for a Fortune 500 company, we started to use natural language processing across SERPs to get an immediate overview of what \"entities\" were driving these rankings and how the content was evolving as Google was updating its results on the target keywords.\r\rI was very pleased to find a great presentation by Stephan Solomonidis that describes exactly this same process.\r\rhttps://www.slideshare.net/StephanSolomonidis/using-natural-language-apis-in-seo\rConclusions and takeaways\rAdvanced SEO strategies powered by Semantic AI\rNLP and entity extraction, as well as Semantic AI (the use of knowledge graphs and machine-learning), are heavily used today by large online properties like TheGuardian or TNW, as well as social networks like Quora. With tools like WordLift, these technologies can be immediately used on personal blogs, e-commerce websites and mid-sized content magazine to improve SEO and to boost user engagement.\r\rAPIs provided by Microsoft, IBM, Google or open source technology providers like Redlink can help SEOs in quickly reading content more effectively with the of an AI that can scan pages at the speed of light.\r\r \tUse NLP and large public graphs like Wikidata and DBpedia to improve the structured data markup on your pages\r \tCreate relevant links and describe the topic that is relevant to your target audience\r \tExploit semantically-rich metadata to improve the quality of the content recommendation on your site\r \tConfigure smart redirections and 301s by de-referencing entities and expanding the synonyms of a given topic (so that users can always find the page they want on your website)\r \tPlay with word-vectors to find inspirations on concepts that you might want to cover in order to become relevant for a specific topic 6.

        "text": "Content Lenght for SEO: How Long Should a Blog Post be? If you own a blog or a website, you have probably heard of the conflict of bite sized content versus longer content. The former used to be popular in the early days of SEO but Google's demands started changing that.\r\rHow much does the length of the content affect the rankings of a page? Is it really that important?\rHow to find a balance\rFor one, you need to understand that creating either long or short content is okay. As long as it provides interesting and engaging information, there is not much else to it.\r\rBoth the long form content and the short content have their own place on your website. You can find good use for both of them. Longer content is often connected with pillar posts, case studies, research articles or similar as well as ebooks or other additional content you offer on your site. Short content can be used as a quick blog update, event update, even a regular blog post but not on a very extensive topic.\rQuality vs length\r\u201cBoth short and long content can be quality but this is often not the case with short ones. They are often keyword stuffed and they miss the point of the topic\u201d says Heath Aberdeen, marketing manager at Writemyx and Australia2write.\r\rHowever, longer articles are usually the ones we all turn to when we need some help - the extensive guides, the how to articles or the listicles.\u00a0So, is length important? In a sense, yes.\r\r\u201cLonger content is better because going in depth on a topic gives the readers more information, valuable knowledge and useful tips. It often contains statistics, comments by industry experts, graphs and tables that illustrate the point and so on\u201d says Amy Shaw,\u00a0content manager at 1Day2Write and Britstudent.\r\rWhile Google definitely doesn't use length as a ranking factors, some things that inherently come with longer content are ranking factors.\rGoogle and length\rGoogle never specifically stated that the length is something they consider. They look at other factors like the quality of backlinks or the keywords in your article. Anyway, it's well known that articles with more content and information get more backlinks from quality sources.\r\rTherefore, longer content gets more backlinks, more shares on social media - and readers also spend a lot more time on a page with long content, something Google is especially fond of.\r\rConsidering that more information means more content, Google could rank longer content better indirectly. When you look at almost any search results, you will notice that the first few - or even the whole page one sometimes - are always longer than 1500 words.\rHow many words should a content have?\rWord count statistics\rA study done by BufferApp found that the highest ranking articles are around 1600 words. Brian Dean came up with similar results and the number of 1890.\r\rOther studies only confirmed the rule - longer content does rank better in search engines.\rAppropriate content length\rThere is no single answer to this - some content is better left short, some deserves more space for discussion. However, the best advice marketers and writers can give you is to make your content as long as it needs to be. Strive for value rather than for length.\rConclusion\rGoogle values content that users find useful. If you want to rank well, always focus just on providing that value and usefulness to your readers. While it's statistically better for your content to be long, anywhere from 800 to 2500 words will do just fine.\r\r[et_pb_section global_module=\"10792\"][/et_pb_section]",

People are bombarded with marketing messages from all sides - and that's before you even get into the content that people actually want to experience, like their favorite films and television shows.\r\rGone are the days where a sleek-looking website is enough to get people to believe in you, your vision and the business you built around it. If you really want to create a competitive advantage for yourself, you need people to start to see you for what you actually are - an authority in your industry and in your marketplace.\r\rYou need to position yourself as a leader - someone to be trusted, respected and followed. Your content - not only the type but how you choose to create that content - are two of the most powerful weapons you have available to you to that end. Make no mistake: the right type of marketing at precisely the right time can turn your customers into an army of loyal followers before you know it. Of course, you just have to keep a few key things in mind to make sure you're headed in the right directions.\rAlways Be Willing to Explore Your Options\rFar too often, online marketers tend to fall into the pattern of creating the same types of content over and over again. They're under the mistaken impression that people will only ever take them seriously if they crank out countless 1,000+ word blog posts. While this format certainly does give you the breathing room you need to slowly establish your credibility, it's hardly the only option out there - or the best.\r\rTechnically, you can publish anything you want on your website. Some types of content, however, stand a better chance of getting noticed and ranked by search engines. Let\u2019s have a look at some\u00a0content examples that are best for SEO.\rAuthoritative Blog Posts\rIn a world where content is a top ranking factor, having a blog would be a fundamental rule to follow. You can it to publish authoritative posts which can help you build a reputation as an industry leader. Apart from focusing on news, case studies, guides and everything\u2019s related to your industry, it would also be great to engage your readers with other topics that your audience would find interesting to analyze.\rVideos and visual content\rVideos make up most of media consumption and web traffic today: in 2018, we've witnessed the value of visual content being emphasized by the changes that occurred across almost every major social network. Videos and visual content have grown into powerful tools for brands looking to communicate more easily with their target audience, and also virtual reality (VR) is finding its place as a marketing tool in various businesses. Visual content marketing strategies can easily show their impact\u00a0on reach, engagement, and sales.\rInfographics\rMany people love to read a well-written article, but there\u2019s who would prefer receiving information that can be processed more easily. Infographics could provide that opportunity to readers and they are also more shareable, giving your content the chance to become popular and be a good source of backlinks.\r\rSo you really should think about the different content formats that your audience might like. Instead of writing that 1,000-word blog post, consider cutting the length in half and expressing the other half by way of a visual survey results report instead. Likewise, instead of sending out a plain email to announce the next big event you're participating in, consider using a flyer maker to really spruce things up in a visual, interesting way that people might not expect from you.\r\r\r\rNone of this is to say that you should suddenly stop writing blog posts and other types of long-form content like white papers. Far from it. The point is that you should be willing to show the many different sides of yourself, showing people exactly what you can do in ways that make people really sit up and start to pay attention to.\rHow-To Guides\rPeople always search for instructions on how to do stuff, and that\u2019s why guides and how-to content will always be a good choice to invest your time on. You can offer your audience insights and tips with either an article, a video or an infographic. One of the best topics to start writing a guide is your industry, of course, and everything related to your area of expertise.\rHow to Create Interactive Content\rInteractive content helps create a dialogue with your audience which means it can help you trigger a direct action from the user. Creating interactive content could be easy if you know where to start. Here\u2019s how to get started:\r\r \tIdentify Your Audience\r\rThe most important thing to do will be identifying your target audience. Create well-defined user personas in order to identify your best chances. A persona is basically a lookalike of your ideal customer, so you need to collect information about the demographics, intentions, habits, what he/she likes or dislike to complete the profile.\r\r \tCreate Specific\u00a0Content For Every Stage of The Funnel\r\rCustomers usually take their time to buy anything, so it\u2019s important to create different types of content for every stage of the buyer journey. Remember that having a precise schedule is crucial while preparing your own editorial plan.\r\rThe image shows the buyer journey and how to use interactive content at every stage of it to achieve the best possible outcome.\rCreate Content For Other People, Too\rAnother one of the best ways to get your prospects to finally see you as an authority in your industry involves creating content not just for your own website, but for others as well. Remember that the Internet is a big place - your customers care about more than just your brand. There are a lot of other people and voices operating within your industry right now who also have their attention. Therefore, one of the keys to establishing yourself as someone who knows what they're talking about involves teaming up with these people as much as you can.\r\rYou might consider creating video content with other industry leaders or thought influencers on topics that are both relevant and important to your mutual target audiences. Not only will you likely get a bit of attention from their audience, but the reverse is also true - creating a mutually beneficial situation for all parties. You could even then upload that content to a service like Uscreen and create new revenue streams for both of you, thus killing two proverbial birds with one stone.\r\rBut maybe the most important thing for you to understand is that Rome wasn't built in a day - and your authority won't be, either. People aren't going to start to trust you or your brand out of the kindness of their hearts. They need to want to. They need to be convinced. Content is how you do it and how you express your thoughts and values through that content is how you get people to believe in what you have to say and, slowly but surely, how you get them to actively want more.\r\r[et_pb_section global_module=\"10534\"][/et_pb_section]\r\r",

        "text": "SEO Case Study: Paola Reghenzi\u2019s Success Story While attending this year\u2019s \u201cDa Zero a SEO\u201d conference, held in Bologna from February 15th to 17th, where we were invited to serve both as a sponsor and as speakers, our CEO Andrea Volpini found himself in a very funny and serendipitous situation.\r\rWhile sitting in the front row of the audience, he noticed that the young man right next to him was using WordLift\u2019s plug-in at that very same moment. What better opportunity to get a warm, live impression from one of our customers than to establish a true relationship, tweet about how fate had brought them together and then ask him a few questions?\r\rhttps://twitter.com/cyberandy/status/1096422409031303169\r\rThe performance of the website managed by Giuseppe has had a real surge in engagement in the last few months thanks to the benefits of WordLift. So we decided to ask him a few questions about his experience and to illustrate the project he manages with the help of our semantic plug-in, and the results of their SEO campaign.\r\r\r\r\rWhen was the website launched, and what kind of website is PaolaReghenzi.it?\rThe website was launched in July 2017 and focuses on issues related to technical and cultural topics of photography, graphics, and most recently, the history of art and photography. Paola usually takes care of the editorial side of the project while the rest of the activities are carried out by Giuseppe.\rHow long have you been using WordLift? How did you learn about our plugin?\rI started using WordLift in mid-November 2018. After doing some research in the area of Semantic SEO and structured data, we found WordLift.\rWas it easy for you to understand and use it? What did it do the most to help you with?\rIt was very intuitive to be able to use the WordPress plug-in thanks to its many features: recognition of possible entities within the various articles and the ability to mark pages and articles as entities. We received the best results on the history of photography, where the photographers have been marked as \"person\" entities, managing to make it clearer.\r\r\rDid you see an increase in traffic since you started using WordLift?\rSince there were few articles published in 2018, the site had little traffic but it was fairly consistent. It lived off of the revenues gained from articles published in 2017. In November, I decided to try WordLift, populating the \"vocabulary\" section with different entities. Without adding or changing any type of content, but only thanks to structured data and the creation of triples, we noticed a significant and steady increase in organic traffic as well as an increase in impressions detected by the Search Console on fairly competitive keywords. Initially, I had dedicated little time to the plug-in, but, thanks to the performance that was above my expectations, I was able to go deeper into the subject and give a real boost to the website, knowing I had a strong ally like WordLift.\rResults\rWordLift has played a key role in the growth strategy of Paola Reghenzi\u2019s website and is now used to enrich every piece of new content. Furthermore, the automated markup of structured data and WordLift\u2019s continuous support has contributed to increasing the organic visibility on the site: +24% in just three months! This means that users have increased by around 16% during this period, thanks to the markup implemented on the website and pages. What a success!\r\r[et_pb_section global_module=\"10045\"][/et_pb_section]",

        "text": "How can a government break your online business? The curious case of France.com 24 years ago, before anyone had ever heard of a tweet, a Facebook timeline, or even what it meant to \u201cGoogle\u201d something, there was France.com. Jean-Noel Frydman began this website as a way for those around the world to get an up-close look at what France has to offer.\r\rThe world of technology is constantly changing, but not always in a positive way. Unfortunately, in 2015, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs created a lawsuit against France.com stating that the use of the name \u201cFrance\u201d was against French law.\r\rDespite the unfortunate determination of Frydman\u2019s website, he still stands by and he is now launching his online business consultancy. Check out our interview below!\rYou\u2019ve been in the digital marketing space since 1994, when you started your first business online, France.com. Can you tell us a little bit more about your background and how you began your path as a digital entrepreneur?\rI was working in Los Angeles, in the movie distribution business. I had no knowledge of computers, but when I stumbled upon the Internet, I thought it would be a very exciting place to launch my business. I had no idea how the online world worked, but that was not a disadvantage since nobody knew anything about this nascent industry.\rHow did you manage to build a successful online business in the travel industry over the years?\rBy focusing on one theme (in our case France) and trying to cover it as well and as extensively as possible. We were also able to be successful by creating new products for that niche and trying to consistently bring innovation to help people make the best of their trip to France.\r\r\rYou were starting to use WordLift - how much has SEO changed in the course of these years?\rSEO has been constantly changing since the dawn of the search engines. However, I would leave the details of how it has changed to the minds of Wordlift, who know this much better than me! But in the small time that we used Wordlift, I was impressed by the results. If only we still had the site to show off your accomplishments!\rYou also managed to build a good relationship with the French institutions overseas, didn\u2019t you? And then what happened?\rYes, in fact my first employer was with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and our first client at France.com was the same minister. I have worked closely with the French government tourist Office for the last 24 years. I am unsure of what happened to our relationship. These institutions that backed our activities for 24 years suddenly decided to paint us as \u2018digital pirates\u2019. Why the turn of heart? The only explanation is a desire from these institutions to profit from having France.com without having to indemnify us or purchase it legally.\rWhat exactly is the French government claiming? Can you elaborate a bit more on the case?\rThe French government is claiming that the word \u2018France\u2019 is now a registered trademark. It\u2019s totally absurd, both legally and even economically. How do you promote France if you can\u2019t use the word?\rWhat\u2019s next on your agenda for this year? Any new online business coming up?\rI\u2019m working on bringing my quarter-century experience online to small businesses to help them get more out of the digital space. One piece of advice I have for them is to use Wordlift for their SEO!",

If RankBrain spots a word or phrase that it isn\u2019t familiar with, the machine can make a guess as to what words or phrases might have a similar meaning and filter the result accordingly. In this way, Google handles effectively never-before-seen search queries or keywords, that - in 2015 - were 15% of all searches.\r\rStudies showed how RankBrain better interpreted the relationships between words. This can include the use of stop words in a search query (such as articles, prepositions, conjunctions, etc), that were historically ignored previously by Google but are sometimes are highly important to fully understand the meaning or intent behind a person\u2019s search query.

        "text": "Bond of trust The bond of trust is a self-representation strategy used by writers and journalists to suggest to the reader an interpretive paradigm.\rThe bond of trust in fictional writing\rIf you are writing fictional stories, chances are that you are building a fictional world which is based on its own rules. To bring the reader on your side, you have to show the rules of your world and to create a\u00a0bond of trust upon them. You can surprise your reader with unexpected events, but you can't introduce anything that is inconsistent with your fictional world.\r\rOn the other side, the reader will follow you with a voluntary\u00a0- and a temporary - suspension of disbelief. While reading, your story, the reader will try to follow and believe you, but be careful: this suspension\u00a0of disbelief is a very fragile state. Every time the reader spots something that is inconsistent with the rules of the world you built, this bond\u00a0dissolves itself a little bit.\r\rSo, consistency is the very basis of the bond of trust. You create the rules, you have to follow them.\r\rIf you are interested in the semiotics behind the bond of trust between a fictional writer and a reader, you should follow Umberto Eco in his essay\u00a0Six Walks in the Fictional Woods.\rThe bond of trust in journalism\rIn journalism, the bond of trust is based on transparency and trustworthiness. To create a bond of trust with their readers, journalists and newspapers have to follow an editorial code\u00a0and respect their readers' need for clarity and coherence.\r\rAs so much in the world of news and information changes, the fundamental bond of trust between journalists and the communities they serve is one of the few things that doesn\u2019t. In fact, its importance has grown.\rCraig Silverman on the American Press Institute\r\rWith a growing number of sources of information and news, sticking upon a bond of trust is more relevant than ever. It's not a just a case that in the last two\u00a0decades many newspapers and news media companies have shared with their audience their\u00a0editorial codes, to reinforce this bond.\r\rIn February 2002, The Guardian was the first English newspaper to publish such a document, and you can read its\u00a0latest version here.",

He united&nbsp;the procedures of the Greek Euclidean geometry with the mathematical calculation tools developed by the Arab and Alexandrian Science.Fibonacci was the son of rich merchants so he found himself traveling extensively around the Mediterranean coast where he learned traders' arithmetical systems, realizing the benefits of the&nbsp;Hindu-Arabic system which he introduced in Europe with his Liber Abaci&nbsp;(Book of Abacus or Book of Calculation), completed in 1202.Fibonacci is also known for the&nbsp;Fibonacci sequence, where every number after the first two is the sum of the two preceding ones. The sequence starts with the number 0 ,1 and continues as follows:&nbsp; 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34... etc. The mathematical rule can be expressed under the form:&nbsp;xn = xn-1 + xn-2...&nbsp;&nbsp;",

Transection of the corpus was an aid to people suffering from epilepsy as the fibres were discovered to transport the seizures from one hemispheres of the brain to the other. Hence the discovery of the specialized functionalities of the two hemispheres, before unknown.\r\rBefore winning the Nobel prize he was awarded with many acknowledgements like California Scientist of the Year Award in 1972; through his life he also worked in many universities all across the States:\u00a0 Yerkes Laboratories of Primate Biology which used to be part of Harvard University, University of Chicago,\u00a0California Institute of Technology.\r\rSperry also served as Professor of Psychobiology Emeritus at California Institute of Technology and on the Board of Trustees.\r\rHe could be found constantly in his office taking notes and lost in thoughts. Sperry as a paleontologist was also a collector of fossils and liked to express himself through art, going camping and fishing with his wife and children.\r\r",

Is this true?

        "text": "Top 4 Successful Examples of Conversational Marketing The way we communicate and interact online is constantly changing. Users have come to expect a much more personal and tailored experience, the type that can\u2019t be provided using traditional ways of interaction.When looking at the words conversational marketing, some people might be wondering what exactly that is. Well, it basically is a strategy that gives customers the personalized value they are looking for and allows businesses to scale while saving time and resources. We found out that through conversational marketing and therefore through live chats, chatbots, and social monitoring it's possible to promote genuine conversations and real relationships. The goal here is, of course, to enhance the\u00a0user\u2019s experience while minimizing friction.Long gone are the days when consumers were passive recipients of marketing messages who had to be bombarded with a blatantly pushy sales pitch in order to be convinced to make a purchase. New, interactive technologies enabled them to break the fourth wall and have their say about how they feel about brands and what they expect from them. This means that the time has come for brands to learn how to listen actively while their customers do the talking. Marketing is a two-way street, and that\u2019s the essence of conversational marketing.What\u2019s Conversational Marketing?Unlike traditional marketing which heavily relied on TV commercials, billboards, newspaper ads, direct mail, and similar methods which customers learned to ignore successfully, conversational marketing enables brands to have relevant, meaningful, one-on-one conversations with their audiences across different channels of communication.Live chat and chatbots are the first things that come to mind when it comes to conversational marketing. However, this strategy is much more than these two tools, and it can be extended to social media, phone calls, SMS, and IMs \u2013 pretty much any channel that your customers prefer.Some of the benefits of such an approach include:Being available 24/7. This is something that your customers will appreciate as you\u2019re putting their needs first, and override your regular working hours which are somewhat limiting. AI-powered bots can answer customers\u2019 questions in real time, be it 7 a.m or midnight. No wonder that by 2020, more than 85% of customer support interactions will be handled by chatbots.Getting to know your audience on a more profound level. These chats and conversations are a gold mine of customer information, and they can help you understand your audience better and start using their language in your messaging.Humanizing your brand. By combining live chat, bots, and social media, your outreach will be much more natural, and you\u2019ll avoid using generic request forms which your customers don\u2019t consider particularly promising in terms of providing them with timely responses.1. Sephora\u2019s Virtual ArtistThe upscale beauty retailer stepped up its marketing game by introducing the Sephora Virtual Artist feature in their Facebook Messenger bot.This innovative AR functionality allows the brand\u2019s customers to \u201ctry on\u201d makeup by uploading their selfies and applying different lipstick shades, eyeshadows, and false lashes.Besides being fun and making it easy for customers to share their makeover photos with friends in order to get valuable feedback or add them to Facebook Stories, Visual Artist offers something much more important \u2013 a try-before-you-buy experience without having to visit a physical store.What\u2019s even better, once a prospective shopper makes their purchasing decision, they can order the products they want directly from the thread, which additionally streamlines and improves the customer journey. The brand reports that Sephora Assistant, a similar Messenger bot for booking makeovers in one of its stores, accounts for an 11% conversion rate increase. 2. eBay\u2019s Google Assistant AppBy 2020, 50% of all queries will be voice searches.This stat is a wake-up call for marketers to\u00a0optimize their content and adjust it to their target audience\u2019s latest fad for voice assistants.eBay\u2019s Google Assistant App tremendously facilitates browsing through the company\u2019s vast online shopping inventory and lets customers start their search by saying \u201cOk, Google, ask eBay to find me\u2026\u201d, and this smart app will ask you additional questions in an attempt to narrow down your search and provide you with the most relevant results. Once it finds the best deal, the chatbot will ask you whether to send the results to your smartphone so that you can complete your purchase.Given that Siri, Alexa, Amazon Echo, and other voice-based assistants are increasingly popular, it\u2019s clear that implementing such a tool can significantly boost customer engagement.This widget comes after the online retailer\u2019s Facebook Messenger ShopBot, which uses AI and Machine Learning in order to personalize the shopping experience based on a deeper understanding of customer intent.Planning and executing such an effective conversational marketing strategy can be a complex endeavor, which is why it\u2019s a good idea to consult experts from digital marketing agencies and see what the best approach will be for your company and how to make it work within your budget.3. Domino\u2019s AnyWareDomino\u2019s wants to make the process of ordering pizza as easy as pie.Back in 2015, the company encouraged its customers to tweet or text a pizza emoji and have a pizza sent their way.This concept evolved further, so that now with Domino\u2019s AnyWare it\u2019s possible to order your favorite items from their menu through a number of available options \u2013 Google Home, Alexa, Slack, Facebook Messenger, Twitter, or even a Smart TV. This versatility and abundance of different channels of communications is something that\u2019s of vital importance to today\u2019s picky customers, and Domino\u2019s does everything g to meet its patrons\u2019 preferences.Again, personalization and an in-depth understanding of customers needs is exactly what helps Domino\u2019s build loyalty thus making sure that its clients will come back knowing that they can easily reorder their favorite item from the menu with a single click, tweet, or word, as well as track their order and see when it will be delivered.[wl_navigator]4. General Motors and Social MediaAlthough conversational marketing is mostly related to innovative chatbots powered by the latest tech, social media is another tool that can make this strategy work.One of the best examples of this approach is General Motors and the way it dealt with the 2014 ignition switch recalls, a crisis which threatened to ruin not only the company\u2019s finances but also its reputation.Over the course of several months, more than 30 million cars worldwide were recalled, while the switch ignition flaw resulted in the deaths of 124 people. G.M. was transparent about the issue and owned it, raising the bar on customer support and experience along the way.Customers flooded the company\u2019s social media channels with distressed comments and negative feedback, and the auto giant had its customer support reps address each and every individual complaint and offered to help on the spot.Some customers got loaner cars until their problems were solved while others were given a refund for the travel expenses caused by the malfunction of their vehicles. Instead of trying to hush things up and switching to traditional tactics such as emails, phone calls, and other more private communication channels General Motors chose to listen to their customers, hear their objections, and proactively handle this huge blunder in the public eye.It\u2019s time to jump on the conversational marketing bandwagon, if you already haven\u2019t, and take a cue from these companies who mastered the art of customer experience and satisfaction with the help of this powerful strategy.\u00a0[et_pb_section global_module=\"10248\"][/et_pb_section]",

        "text": "The Constant Evolution of Voice Search The Future of Voice Search\rTechnology is all around us, and there is no escaping it. The best thing is that it is continually evolving as technological breakthroughs are seen almost on a daily basis. One of the technologies which are getting better every day and making our lives easier is voice search.\rWhen Did It All Begin?\rMore than half a century ago, IBM introduced IBM Shoebox which was the first speech recognition tool. The father of voice recognition devices was able to recognize 16 words and the digits from 0 to 9. As you will see in the infographic below by SEOTribunal, voice recognition technology has come a long way to become what it is today since its beginnings. Mostly implemented by mobile device manufacturers, today\u2019s voice technology gives users the ability to do online searches, find information about products, ask questions, ask for directions or for the weather forecast, and many other things just by talking to a device.\r\r\r\r\rHow Does Voice Search Work?\rFirst of all, it processes and transcribes the human speech into text before analyzing it in order to detect questions and commands. After that, it connects to external data sources such as search engines to find the relevant information and translates that information into a digestible format to fulfill the user\u2019s intent.\r\r\rWhat Are The Best Voice Search Engines?\rThere is a continuous battle between big players to make the best voice search engine. This is good news as voice search assistants are becoming more and more sophisticated, thus making our lives easier. Let\u2019s take a look at the top brands manufacturing these devices.\r\r \tGoogle Assistant is powered by AI and is primarily available on mobile and smart home devices. It was launched in 2016, and the thing which makes it different from its predecessors is that it can engage in two-way conversations.\r \tMicrosoft\u2019s Cortana was released in April 2014. Available in multiple languages, it has the ability to set reminders, recognizes the natural voice, and answer questions by using the information found on Bing.\r \tAmazon\u2019s Echo has many capabilities, such as voice interaction, music playback, creating to-do lists, and streaming podcasts, to name just a few. The best thing about it is that it can be extended by installing other functions which are developed by third-party vendors.\r \tSamsung\u2019s Bixby is a voice-powered digital assistant introduced in 2017. It is a major reboot for S Voice. Aside from being used on smartphones and other mobile devices, Bixby is included in Samsung\u2019s Family Hub 2.0 refrigerators, which are the first non-mobile products to include a virtual assistant.\r \tApple\u2019s Siri is part of its iOS, iWatch, MacOS, HomePod, and Apple Tv operating systems. It works by using voice queries and a natural-language user interface to do actions such as answering questions, checking for information, navigating, and many other things.\r\rWhat Lies Ahead?\rAs of January 2018, around 1 billion voice searches were made per month, and in the next couple of years, 50% of searches will be made using the voice-enabled technology. It is also predicted that over the next years the voice recognition market is going to experience huge growth, with an estimated $601 million in 2019 only.\rConclusions\rWe can definitely say that the future of voice-enabled technology is bright. The constant need for improvement is the driving force that makes companies produce the best voice assistants out there. Both the companies and their customers bear the fruit from it.\r\r&nbsp;\r\r[et_pb_section global_module=\"10221\"][/et_pb_section]",

Kudos to Nevine!While WordLift\u2019s Natural Language APIs, the pre-trained machine learning models that WordLift uses to reveal the structure and meaning of your articles, already supported the Arabic language, the user interface of the WordPress plugin was available only in English and Italian (some of it is also translated into German and Danish).Thanks to Nevine\u2019s help now, clients like the American University of Cairo and Merck in Egypt, along with thousands of other Arabic speaking WordPress users, can now automate their SEO using WordLift in their own native language.Here is a screenshot of SalamTak: a blog curated by Merck and focused on Multiple sclerosis (MS).Why localization is so important?Localization is key. In order to let our Arabic colleagues, partners and clients, that are already using WordPress in their native language, use WordLift with full confidence we decided to fully localize the plugin in Arabic.Helping Translate WordPress in Your LanguageWordPress is available in many languages and can be translated into other languages as well. WordLift as any other plugin on WordPress can be translated into other languages using translate.wordpress.org a web-based translation tool that allows anyone to contribute translations of WordPress core and any Themes or Plugins hosted on WordPress.org. &nbsp;When you install a new plugin, you certainly feel more comfortable if they are in your native language. Your user experience is better if you can read everything \u2013 from the readme to the meta-boxes and buttons \u2013 in your own language.2019 has just begun and this is really the first result to celebrate: from now on our semantic plugin can be used also in Arabic ?

        "text": "What is Link Prospecting and how can it help your SEO efforts? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [Guest post by Emma Miller]&nbsp;Did you know that over 3.5 billion searches take place on Google every day? This simply means that to get a piece of traffic and boost conversions, you need to appear on the first page of Google. And, to do so, you need to have an SEO strategy. Well, link prospecting certainly can help identify relevant opportunities for your website.When implemented properly, SEO can double your site\u2019s visibility in the SERPs, drive more traffic to it, help you address the right customers, boost their conversions and, above all, give you a chance to build a solid brand name.After all, it\u2019s 2018, and no one trusts businesses that are not online. In other words, SEO has become an obligatory investment for any business that wants to stay relevant.Now, you don\u2019t have to be a seasoned marketer to know that guest blogging is one of the most significant SEO practices. It\u2019s a powerful way to build links and is basically synonymous with doing off-site SEO.However, many digital marketing experts claim that this technique is dead. Just remember Google\u2019s Matt Cutts, who claimed that \u201cguest blogging has gotten too spammy\u201d in 2014.However, his judgment could have been wrong. Maybe guest blogging is still alive and kicking. You just need to know how to implement it properly.So, what is the idea behind Link Prospecting?Finding quality guest blogging opportunities may seem simple at the beginning. You run a couple of Google searches and make a list of content-rich sites in your niche, where you can publish your guest articles.But, this sounds too good to be true. Namely, when you take a closer look at your list, you will understand the challenge you\u2019re facing. Not all the sites on your list are worth connecting with, for instance. No matter if it\u2019s a bad content strategy or low PA or DA, once you spot a poor-quality blog, you should run away screaming.So, you need to do a more complex, advanced analysis and separate the wheat from the chaff. This is what link prospecting is about \u2013 finding quality and relevant sites in your niche that will give your SEO efforts an actual boost.Why is Finding Quality Link Building Opportunities Important?The idea behind writing awesome content and publishing it on quality sites is earning quality backlinks. Your backlink portfolio is the decisive factor for Google when assessing your site\u2019s value. If it notices that there are numerous highly authoritative and quality links pointing back to your domain, it will consider it relevant and boost its rankings in the SERPs.Generating exceptional backlinks can also boost your overall domain authority, expand your target audience, prove your expertise, and help you establish a recognizable brand. This is also an opportunity to build relationships with the influencers in your niche and boost your exposure. Namely, once they see that the top players in your industry share or link to your posts organically, your target audience will trust you more.How to Know which Sites are Valuable Enough?To make sure you find the right prospects, you first need to set your objectives clearly. For instance, if you want to boost your authority in your niche via guest posting, you need to become a regular contributor on all major sites in that industry \u2013 so, just make an actionable list and go!On the other hand, if you just want to earn some organic and high-quality links, guest posting will be much simpler for you. Of course, you will have a much longer list of prospects to connect with and publish your work. All you have to do is check the site\u2019s DA, see if they published guest posts before, and reach out to them.Once you select the right targets, you need to see who their target audience is and what their niche is. You should also check traffic and see if people visit their site, as well as pay attention to their backlink portfolio, the quality of their articles, and engagement metrics like the number of shares, likes, comments. These are all some key performance indicators that tell you whether the site is worth your attention.Finding Quality Link ProspectsOnce you set your goals, understand the metric you need to track, and what sort of sites you should be looking for, you can start your search. Here are a few most effective link prospecting ideas you should keep in mind: \tStart with basic&nbsp;Google search strings \tTo narrow down your searches, use advanced search operators, such as the intitle search, the inurl search, the exact match search, etc. \tAutomate your link prospecting efforts using link building tools. These tools will analyze and choose only quality link building opportunities for you, give you invaluable data about your prospects, show their contact emails, helping you find the right sites and connect with them much faster. \tConduct competitor analysis to monitor and replicate their most effective link building strategies. \tTake the time to produce original images and include them in your piece \u2013 that can become an effective SEO strategy to bring traffic back to your site! \tSearch for broken links on a site you\u2019re interested in, offering a link to your similar post as a replacement for a broken link. \tLook for influencers to boost your authority. To do so effectively, you can use Twitter search or its advanced options or simply use a link prospecting tool.&nbsp;Back to UsLink prospecting is an immensely important part of building valuable backlinks. It helps you publish your content on quality sites that will really bring value to your SEO. Most importantly, it helps you improve your visibility, expand your target audience, and position yourself as authoritative. And, these are just some of a myriad of practices you may use to find relevant link building opportunities.&nbsp;[et_pb_section global_module=\"9713\"][/et_pb_section]",

        "text": "Why The Knowledge Panel Is Critical For Your SEO Strategy As search engines move toward voice search, mobile personal assistants adoption is growing at a fast rate. While the transition is already happening, there is another interesting phenomenon to notice. The SERP has changed substantially in the last couple of years. As Google rolls out new features that appear on the \u201cabove the fold\u201d (featured snippets, knowledge panels, and featured snippets filter bubbles), those allow us to understand how voice search might look.In this article, we\u2019ll focus mainly on the Knowledge Panel, why it is critical, and how you can get it too.\u00a0The Knowledge Panel: The Google's above the fold worth billionsThe Knowledge Panel is a feature that Google provides quick and reliable information about brands (be them personal or company brands). For instance, in the case above, you can see that for the query \u201cwho\u2019s Gennaro Cuofano\u201d on the US search results, Google is giving both a featured snippet (on the left) and a knowledge panel (on the right).While the featured snippet aims to provide a practical answer, fast; the knowledge panel aims to provide a reliable answer (coming from a more authoritative source) and additional information about that brand. In many cases, the knowledge panel is also a \u201ccommercial feature\u201d that allows brands to monetize their products. For instance, you can see how my knowledge panel points toward books on Amazon that could be purchased in the past.This space on the SERP, which I like to call \u201cabove the fold,\u201d has become the most important asset on the web. While Google's first page remains an objective for most businesses, it is also true that going toward voice search traffic will be eaten more and more by those features that appear on the search results pages, even before you get to the first position.\u00a0How does Google create Knowledge Panels? And how do you get one?Knowledge Panel examplesHere are some examples of Google Knowledge Panels, which refer to different search categories (sports, books, movies, celebrities).\u00a0\u00a0SPORT\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 BOOK\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0MOVIE\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0FAMOUS PERSON\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Knowledge panel: the key ingredient is Google's knowledge vaultAs Google points out:When people search for a business on Google, they may see information about that business in a box that appears to the right of their search results. The information in that box, called the knowledge panel, can help customers discover and contact your business. In most cases, you'll notice two main kinds of Knowledge Panels:Brand panelsLocal panelsWhile brand panels provide generic information about a person or company's brand, local panels offer local information. You can see how the local panel offers the local business's address, hours, and phone in the example above. In short, that is a touchpoint provided by Google between the user and the local industry.Where does Google get the information from the Knowledge Panel? Google itself specifies that \"Knowledge panels are powered by information in the Knowledge Graph.\"What is a Knowledge Graph?In 2012 Google started to build a \"massive Semantics Index\" of the web called Knowledge Graph. In short, a knowledge graph is a logical way to organize information on the web. In the past, Google could not rely on the direct meaning of words on a web page. With the knowledge graph, instead, the search engine can collect information on the web and organize it around simple logical phrases, called triples (for ex. \"I am Gennaro\" and \"Gennaro knows Jason\"). Those triples are combined according to logical relationships, and those relationships are built on top of a vocabulary called Schema.org. In short, Schema.org defines the possible relationships available among things on the web.Thus, two people that in Schema are defined as entity type \"person\" can be associated via a property called \"knows.\" That is how we might make it clear to Google that the two people know each other.From those relationships among things (which can be people, organizations, events, or any other item on the web), a Knowledge Graph is born:[caption id=\"attachment_9687\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1024\"] Example of a knowledge graph shaped on a web page from FourWeekMBA that answers the query \u201cWho\u2019s Gennaro Cuofano\u201d[/caption]Where does Google get the information to comprise in its Knowledge Graph? As pointed out on Go Fish Digital, some of the sources are:WikipediaStructured DataG+ PageWikidataAnd other sourcesIn short, there isn\u2019t a single source from where Google mines the information to include in its Knowledge Panels.Is a Knowledge Panel worth your time and effort?Is it worth it to gain a knowledge panel?A Knowledge Panel isn't only the avenue toward voice search but also an organic traffic hack. It's interesting to see how a good chunk of Wikipedia traffic comes from Google's knowledge panels. Of course, Wikipedia is a trusted and authoritative website. Also, one consequence of knowledge panels might be the so-called no-clicks searches (those who don't necessarily produce a click-through from the search results pages).Yet, as of now, a Knowledge Panel is an excellent opportunity to gain qualified traffic from search and get ready for voice search.How do you get your Knowledge Panel?Use additional Schema properties to allow the cross-reference of the dataCheck if you have a Freebase IDUse Schema markup and structured dataCreate an item on WikidataCreate a Wikipedia pageKey takeawaysAs search evolves toward AEO, it also changes how you need to look at content structuring. As Google SERP adds features, such as featured snippets and Knowledge Panels, those capture a good part of the traffic. Thus, as a company, person, or business, you need to understand gaining traction via knowledge panels. The key is Google's Knowledge Graph, which leverages the Google knowledge vault.It is your turn now to start experimenting to get your Knowledge Panel!Big News: Podcast Knowledge Panel now live on Google Search!

        "text": "How knowledge graphs can help your travel brand attract more visitors For the first time this year we can finally say that knowledge graphs and semantic technologies are hype. People like me, who played with the semantic web stack for several years now, have long predicted that one day we would have a Graph for Everything. We did wait for long and hopefully not in vain ? until recently Gartner finally shout out loud that 2018 is indeed the \"Year of the Graph\". We, here at WordLift, are far beyond the hype. We have built technologies, open source frameworks, companies and products on this vision of semantic web, knowledge representation and ontologies. [caption id=\"attachment_9497\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1501\"] Knowledge Graphs in the Gartner's Hype Cycle for 2018.[/caption]For many years, way too many, talking with large enterprises or public institutions like the Italian Parliament about the importance of creating taxonomies and labeling information has been extremely frustrating, and yet I am very thankful to everyone who has listened to me and helped us get to the point of writing an article like this one.Knowledge graphs are real and bring a competitive advantage to large enterprises like Amazon, Google, LinkedIn, Uber, Zalando, Airbnb, Microsoft, and other internet powerhouses but no, this article is not about giant graphs from large enterprises. It is about our direct experience in helping travel brands like bungalowparkoverzicht in the Netherlands, the largest tour operator in Iceland and SalzburgerLand in Austria. [box]WHAT IS A KNOWLEDGE GRAPH?A knowledge graph is a way of representing human-knowledge to machines. In short, you start by defining the main concepts as nodes and the relationships\u00a0among these concepts as edges in a graph. READ MORE[/box]Not all Graph are created equal and each organization has its own business goals and ways of representing relationships between related entities. We model data and build knowledge graphs to create a context, to improve content findability by leveraging on semantic search engines like Google and Bing and to provide precise answers to certain questions. When you have organized your data semantically and you have built your own taxonomy there are many applications that can be implemented: from classifying items to integrating data coming out of different pipelines, from building complex reasoning systems, to publishing metadata on the web. When we built the knowledge graph for a travel brand like bungalowparkoverzicht our main focus was on the type of information that a traveler would need before reaching the destinations.We model data for the so-called \u201cplanning and booking moments\u201d. Planning, accordingly to a research from Google, starts when a digital traveler has chosen a destination and is then looking for the right time and place to stay. Then the booking will follow, and that\u2019s the moment when the travelers move into reserving their perfect hotel, choose a room and reserve it. Types of Information to model for the planning and booking momentsWhen modeling hotel-related information in Web content using the schema.org vocabulary you basically work with three core type of nodes (entity types):A lodging business, (e.g. a hotel, hostel, resort, or a camping site): essentially the place and local business that houses the actual units of the establishment (e.g. hotel rooms). The lodging business can encompass multiple buildings but is in most cases a coherent place.An accommodation, i.e. the actually relevant units of the establishment (e.g. hotel rooms, suites, apartments, meeting rooms, camping pitches, etc.). These are the actual objects that are offered for rental.An offer to let a hotel room (or other forms of accommodations) for a particular amount of money and for a given type of usage (e.g. occupancy), typically further constrained by advance booking requirements and other terms and conditions.[caption id=\"attachment_9509\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"960\"] Schema Markup for hotels and lodging businesses.[/caption]Relationships (edges in the graph) between these entities are designed in such a way that several potential conversations between a lodging business and a potential client become possible. We simply:a) encode these relationships using an open vocabulary and, by doing so, \u00a0b) easily enable search engines and/or virtual assistants to traverse these connections in multiple ways.As seen above we can map - using the vocabulary - all the hospitality infrastructures as schema:Organization and create a page listing all the different companies behind these businesses or we can list these hotels and lodging facilities using their geolocation and the properties of the schema:Place type.Making it happenThe content management system in the back-end uses a relational database, and this is just great as most of the data needs to be used with transactional processes (versioning, reviews are all based on efficiently storing data into tables). Our work is to apply to each data-point the semantics required to:publish metadata on the web using structured data that machines can understand index each item of the property inventory (i.e. all the proposed hotels, all the locations, ...) with a unique identifier and a corresponding representation in an RDF knowledge graph semantically annotate editorial content with all the nodes that are relevant for our target audience (i.e. annotating an article about a camping site in the Netherlands with the same entity that connects that location with the related schema:LodgingBusiness) \u00a0\u00a0have a nice and clean API to query and eventually enrich the data in the graph using other publicly available data coming from Wikidata, GeoNames or DBpediaprovide search engines and virtual assistants with the booking URL using schema:ReserveAction(see the example below) to make this data truly actionable.1. Publishing metadata on the Web: data quality becomes KingSince major search providers (including Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Yandex) joined forces to define a common language for semantic markup, semantic web technologies became an important asset of online business of all sort. At the time of writing this article, 10 million websites use Schema.org to mark up their web pages.[caption id=\"attachment_9514\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"960\"] Structured Data Growth from the Common Web Crawl.[/caption]While there is a growing interest in adding structured data in general, the focus is now shifting from providing whatever form of structured data to providing high-quality data that can have a real impact on the new entity-oriented search.[box]WHAT IS ENTITY-ORIENTED SEARCH?Entity-oriented search, as defined by Krisztian Balog in his book, is the search paradigm of organizing and accessing information centered around entities, and their attributes and relationships. [/box]Ranking high on long tail intents like the ones we see in the travel sector is - in several cases - about providing consistent and reliable information in a structured form. [caption id=\"attachment_9516\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"960\"] How structured data might be used in Google synthetic queries.[/caption]The importance of geocoding the addressTo give you a practical example, when making explicit the data about the address of the lodging business for the Dutch website, we realised that the data we had in the CMS wasn\u2019t good enough to be published online using schema and we decided to reverse geocode the address and extract the data in a clean and reliable format, using an external API. A simple heuristic like this one improves the quality of the data describing thousands of lodging businesses that can now be unambiguously ranked for various type of searches. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Using well-known datasets to disambiguate location-specific characteristics In schema, when describing most of the hotel-related types and properties - e.g. telling hosts that the hotel might have a WiFi Internet connection - we can use the amenityFeature\u00a0property that is derived from the STI accommodation ontology (our friends in Innsbruck at the Semantic Technology Institute that have greatly contributed to the travel extension of Schema).Unfortunately, there is not common taxonomy yet for describing these properties (the wifi or the presence of a safe in the room). In order to help search engines and virtual assistants disambiguate these properties at best, in WordLift we\u2019re providing a mapping between these hotel-related properties and entities in Wikidata. In this way, we can add an unambiguous pointer to - let\u2019s say - the concept of WiFi, that in Wikidata corresponds to the entity Q29643.2. Creating unique IDs for entities in the graphWhen representing the nodes in our graph we create entities and we group them in a catalog (we call it vocabulary). All the entities we have in the catalog belong to different types (i.e. Lodging business, Organization, Place, Offer). The entity catalog defines the universe we know and each entity has its own unique identifier. The fact that we can have an ID for each node turns out to be surprisingly useful as it allows us to have a \u00a0one-to-one correspondence between a node (represented by its ID) and the real-world object it represents. An accommodation like the Strand Resort Ouddorp Duin in the South of Holland, for example, has its own unique ID in the graph on http://data.wordlift.io/wl0760/vakantiepark/strand_resort_ouddorp_duin.3. Bridging text and structureCombining structured and unstructured information is key for improving search\u00a0breadth and quality from external search engines like Google and Bing. It also becomes very important to provide a consistent user experience within the site. Let\u2019s say that you are referring, in an article from the blog, to South of Holland or to the Landal Strand Resort we talked about before: you want your users to see the latest promotions from this resort and/or offers from other properties nearby. Connecting editorial content from the blog using the data in the graph is called entity-linking. It is done by annotating mentions of specific entities (or properties of these entities) being described in a text, with their own unique identifiers from the underlying knowledge graph. This creates a context for the users (and for external search engines) and a simple way to improve the user experience by suggesting a meaningful navigation path (i.e. \u201clet\u2019s see all the resorts in the region\u201d or \u201clet\u2019s see the latest offers from the Strand Resort\u201d). \u00a0[caption id=\"attachment_9520\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"700\"] Florian Bauhuber from Tourismuszukunft presenting SLT Knowledge Graph at Castelcamp Kaprun 2018.[/caption]4. Discovering new facts by linking external data[caption id=\"attachment_9523\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"713\"] Kaprun in GeoNames.[/caption]Having a graph in RDF format is also about linking your data with other data. A great travel destination in Salzburgerland like Kaprun has its own entity ID in the graph\u00a0http://open.salzburgerland.com/en/entity/kaprunbuilt by the Region of Salzburg using WordLift. This entity is linked with the equivalent entities in the Web of data. In GeoNames it corresponds to the entity http://sws.geonames.org/2774758/ (GeoNames is a freely available geographical database that contains a lot more properties about Kaprun that what we store in our graph). We can see from GeoNames that Kaprun is 786m above sea level and belongs to the Zell am See region in Salzburgerland. These informations are immediately accessible to search engines and can be also stored in the index of the website internal search engine to let users find Kaprun when searching for towns in Zell am See or destination in Salzburgerland close to a lake. This wealth of open data, interlinked with our graph, can be made immediately accessible to our users by adding attributes in Schema that search engines understand. An internal search engine with these information becomes \u201csemantic\u201d and we don't need to maintain or curate this information (unless we find it unreliable). Wow! \u00a0\u00a0[box]WHAT IS RDF?The Resource Description Framework (RDF), \u00a0is a W3C standard for describing entities in a knowledge base.\u00a0An entity such as a hotel can be represented as a set of RDF statements. These statements may be seen as facts or assertions about that entity. A knowledge graph is a structured knowledge repository for storing and organizing statements about entities.\u00a0READ MORE[/box][caption id=\"attachment_9525\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"538\"] SLT Knowledge Graph in the Linked Open Data Cloud.[/caption]5. From answering questions to making it all happen: introducing Schema ActionsWe use nodes and edges in the graph to help search engines and virtual assistants answer specific questions like \u201cWhere can I find a camping site with a sauna close to a ski resort in Germany?\u201d. These are informational intents that can be covered by providing structured data using the schema.org vocabulary to describe entities. In 2014 Schema.org, the consortium created by the search engines to build a common vocabulary introduced a new extension called Actions. The purpose of Schema Actions is to go beyond the static description of entities - people, places, hotels, restaurants, \u2026 and to describe the actions that can be invoked (or have been invoked) using these entities. In the context of the knowledge graph for a travel brand, we\u2019re starting to use Schema Actions to let search engines and virtual assistants know what is the URL to be used for booking a specific hotel. Here is an example of the JSON-LD code injected in the page of a camping village providing the indication of the URL that can be used on the different devices (see the attribute \u00a0actionPlatform) to initiate the booking process.   \"potentialAction\": {\t\"@type\": \"ReserveAction\",\t\"target\": {  \t    \"@type\": \"EntryPoint\",  \t    \"urlTemplate\": \"/boek/canvas-belvedere-village/\",  \t    \"inLanguage\": \"nl-NL\",  \t    \"actionPlatform\": [    \t        \"http://schema.org/DesktopWebPlatform\",    \t        \"http://schema.org/IOSPlatform\",    \t        \"http://schema.org/AndroidPlatform\"  \t    ]\t},\t\"result\": {  \t    \"@type\": \"LodgingReservation\",  \t    \"name\": \"Reserveren of meer informatie?\"\t}  }Next steps and final thoughts As we\u2019re continuing to explore new ways to collect, improve and reuse the information in the knowledge bases we are building with our clients in the travel industry, a new landscape of applications is emerging. Data is playing a pivotal role in the era of personal assistants, content recommendations and entity-oriented search. We are focusing on making knowledge as explicit as possible inside these organizations, to help searchers traverse it in a meaningful way.The semantic web is a branch of artificial intelligence specifically designed to transfer human knowledge to machines. Human knowledge, in the travel sector, is really what creates a concrete business value for the travelers. When planning for a next vacation we are constantly looking for something new, sometimes even unusual, but at the same time we need full reliability and we want to complete the planning and booking process in the best possible way, and with the least amount of effort.\u00a0For travel brands, destinations, online travel agencies, and resorts building a knowledge graph is truly the best way to improve the traveler experience, to market the travel offers and to prepare for the \u201cAI-first world\u201d of voice search and personal assistants.

        "text": "What The Best Brand Publishers Are Doing Right Now Traditional publishers and print media companies have seen their profitability tumble as more and more of our daily media habits have moved online. This change gave rise to the seemingly-unstoppable growth of digital content marketing as a core promotional tool, which subsequently spawned the concept of a brand publisher.\r\rRecognizing that they no longer needed to rely on conventional media platforms to reach people and get attention, businesses have begun to produce and distribute their own content. It allows them to lower their advertising costs and operate with much greater creative freedom.\r\rBut the model of a brand acting as a publisher isn\u2019t a magic bullet. There are companies getting it horribly wrong, as well as companies executing it to perfection. In this piece, we\u2019re going to look at the latter, seeing what the successful brand publishers are doing to make this relatively-fresh arrangement function optimally.\rCarrying out regular content audits\rA content audit is a comprehensive review of all of your live content, looking at numerous elements (such as page titles or subheadings) and collating the data into a single spreadsheet suitable for an overarching assessment \u2014 and the brands with the best content know how important it is to schedule a regular content audit.\r\rNewspaper content goes out of date rapidly, and that\u2019s fine given the disposable nature of the medium. You read one edition, discard it, and await the next. But old digital content isn\u2019t worthless, particularly if written to touch upon universal themes, and savvy brands take every opportunity to spruce up their old content and bring it in line with today\u2019s standards.\r\rFollowing the advent of smarter content tagging and structuring suitable for search algorithms as well as humans, a lot of content (even from recent years) is lacking in some important areas. This is one reason why it\u2019s important to have a solid structural framework in place (either systemwide or provided through an integrated tool) to make the updating process easier.\rInvesting in cornerstone work\rThere\u2019s an absurd amount of content available for free through the internet. It barely even matters what the topic is, because even the most niche pursuit will have myriad dedicated blogs featuring similar articles. Brands that aspire to become respected \u2018publishers\u2019 but lack any sense often settle for the content barrage method \u2014 release as many articles as you can, on as many topics as you can cover, and as quickly as can be achieved.\r\rBut just as 100 multiplied by 0 is still just 0, no amount of low-quality content will accomplish anything of note. And when I say \u2018low-quality\u2019, I don\u2019t simply mean simply technical quality. I mean general quality \u2014 how useful the points are, how good the writing is, etc.\r\rGreat brand publishing is about quality, not quantity. That means looking past the hammered-out posts about nothing and focussing on creating content so good that it will get the kind of attention you\u2019re looking for. It doesn\u2019t even have to be that long or complex \u2014 it just needs to resonate, like this sponsored Airbnb piece.\r\r\rGetting feedback from the people who matter\rLet\u2019s imagine for a second that I consider this piece the best thing I\u2019ve ever written, viewing it as an informative masterpiece (untrue, but go with it). If you can barely tolerate my style and reach the conclusion feeling that you\u2019ve entirely wasted your time, what difference does my opinion make? It may be notable, but it isn\u2019t valuable. I\u2019m not the target audience.\r\rSince brand publishing is just another evolution of product or service marketing, its end goal is crystal-clear: make more money. How it gets there might vary, of course, but every path leads in the same direction: you promote a product so the reader might buy it, make your brand look good to make people want to buy from you, or provide a valuable resource to earn goodwill and (yes, you guessed it) make people want to buy from you.\r\rThe top brands in the world commit a lot of time and effort to acquiring, interpreting and learning from feedback. They know whose opinions ultimately lead to sales, and whose aren\u2019t worth considering at all, and they use that information to make their published content more practical.\r\r\rEffectively using user-generated content\rAs a brand publisher, you\u2019re not simply a humble purveyor of in-house content \u2014 you\u2019re in charge of your very own content ecosystem, and you can feature whatever you want. User-generated content (UGC) is perfect for this scenario, because it has so many benefits: it entertains your audience, brings in their feedback (important, as we\u2019ve just seen), provides fresh perspectives, and takes some of the load off your content production team.\r\rCoca Cola innovated with its \u2018Share a Coke with\u2019 campaign in a time (2011) when the concept of UGC was very fresh (and only fairly recently made possible through the mainstream acceptance of social media). People really wanted to be involved and produced a lot of visual content that made the Coca Cola brand look great.\r\r\r\rIndeed, the practice of using UGC in the form of reviews and/or photos has been a cost-effective revelation, particularly for ecommerce where anyone with a basic webshop host system\u00a0like Shopify can curate gallery feeds using add-ons like Covet.pics or TagTray. Dominant brands know how to balance content types, mixing expert in-house long-form content with lighter fare driven by user-created work.\rExperimenting with different formats\rThis piece by Samuel Scott really tears into the notion of a brand publisher, describing it as contradictory, but it misses the mark in a lot of places. For example, Scott presumes that brand publishers must present themselves as journalists, when in reality that\u2019s only something bad brands do. The good ones are quite nakedly promotional, and understand that people will accept promotional content if they\u2019re sufficiently entertained.\r\rBut Scott\u2019s general point about content feeling generic certainly hits home. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with the \u201cX Things You Need To Know About Y\u201d format, but that kind of piece is only ever going to achieve a certain level of traffic. Any brand publishers that want to be exceptional need to try different things.\r\rAnd while the title is definitely worth considering, the format is a far more interesting and valuable matter. Look at any roundup of hit branded content (such as this one from Forbes) and you\u2019ll see a lot of content rich with imagery and narratives. And see how this Nest-sponsored piece from The Atlantic mixes media types to provide a more engaging experience than a standard article could ever achieve.\rKey Take-Aways\rBrand publishing isn\u2019t about feigning neutrality and posting countless pieces concluding that your particular software, service or product is superior to any other. It\u2019s about using your keen understanding of the people you\u2019re trying to address to find new and creative ways to entertain, inform and delight them, establishing your personality in the process.\r\rI can guarantee you that the top brand publishers are doing each and every one of these things right now, and that\u2019s the dedication that\u2019s needed to stand out. If you aspire to turn your brand into a respected content source, you know where you need to start!\r\r&nbsp;\r\r[et_pb_section global_module=\"9265\"][/et_pb_section]",

        "text": "How to build a successful marketing strategy with Influencers and great content Digital marketing is expanding in a world of almost infinite possibilities, where every bit of strategy matters: there\u2019s always the alternative that the one you chose a might not perform well on its own. In that scenario, content marketing and influencer marketing are two sides of the same coin and they could and must work together to build a strong\u00a0strategy.\r\rEveryone involved in the business can use marketing tools to reach greater success and higher interaction with their brand. So the question becomes, what kind of initiatives should be used? In 2018 there are many different types of marketing strategies so it can be hard to keep up with them all, let alone know which one would be best for you or your company. According to HubSpot, 55% of brands know they need a content distribution strategy, but only 26% are willing to pay to do that. There\u2019s two kinds of marketing strategies that are showing great success right now; influencer marketing and content marketing. Although they have some similarities, they are actually quite different.\r\r\rHow great content can catch your targeted audience\u2019s attention\rThe Content Marketing Institute defines content marketing as \u201cthe process of creating and distributing relevant and valuable content to attract, acquire, and engage an audience with the objective of driving profitable customer action.\u201d This kind of marketing is well known and well received. However, there are some limitations to what will work. The quality of your content plays a prominent role in the success - or the failure - of a marketing campaign.\u00a0Customers want to experience informative content, rather than promotional. They don\u2019t want to feel as though you are pushing a product on them. Besides, content must be authentic, engaging and, above all, useful. It is better to position your brand as a resource for your audience, in the fields that interest them.\r\rLoyalty to your products will come once the initial relationship has been established.\r\rTo get a better understanding of what your audience wants to see, it\u2019s always better to conduct some market research to determine what interests them. You can look at previously published content and compare what has been successful within your demographic. It\u2019s important to know what your audience likes, dislikes, and responds to in general, not just about your company. Producing this kind of content will show that you care about the audience and understand what\u2019s happening within your target community.\r\rThere are a number of different content marketing variations you can try. One of the simpler strategies is creating and maintaining a blog. With this platform, you allow yourself the opportunity to continuously post articles on subjects your community cares about. It\u2019s a great place to position yourself as a resource or \u201cgo-to\u201d spot for information on your industry. Other methods include different mediums of content such as video or podcasts. These forms of content are more popular than ever, and some consumers even prefer it to written content. According to Brightcove's blog, \u201cbrands that use videos can expect to see an average increase of 157% in organic traffic from search engines.\u201d\r\r\r\rIn addition to these content formats, the list goes on. There are more traditional forms such as infographics and interviews. You can also explore trendier\u00a0types of content like GIFs, memes, and general social media.\r\rContent marketing is beneficial for many reasons. It is relatively inexpensive, which means it can lead to a considerable ROI. This kind of marketing plan can also support other projects you\u2019re working on. It proves to be efficient because it can blend into other strategies such as creating additional content for social media, and it may help to boost your SEO.\rInfluencer Marketing: find the right match for your brand\rIf you think you\u2019ve never heard, witnessed, or been affected by influencer marketing, think again! This form of marketing is being used equally, if not more often than content marketing. First of all, to engage your audience with influencer marketing, you need to create an ideal influencer persona that fits your brand\u2019s needs: once you find it/them, you can start working with your chosen personality and having them market your brand or product for you.\u00a0Although many people assume this happens with big celebrities who have millions of followers, that\u2019s not necessarily the most efficient or effective route. Depending on the influencer you want to work with, the price can vary. Thanks to micro-influencers, this might not be as expensive as you once thought.\r\rThe term micro-influencer has become a bigger topic within the past year, and for good reason. These are influencers with a smaller following of around 10,000 to 100,000 across social media. Because they aren\u2019t as well known or a \u201cbig name\u201d they often charge less, and might even accept some products or social shoutout in return for mentioning your brand.\r\rInfluencers with a smaller following tend to come across as more authentic than well-known celebrities, who clearly only talk about a product for the money. Most often micro-influencers share a product or brand because they truly like it, and want to share their honest thoughts and advice to followers. It\u2019s an authentic way for influencers to connect with their followers and build trust in the long run.\r\rThese influencers share your product by creating video reviews, Instagram posts and stories, and tweets. With more than 700 million people using social media per month, these methods can be vital when trying to grow a business.\r\r\r\rIf you\u2019re more concerned with getting your product or content to a larger number of people, influencer marketing is becoming the chosen strategy for this. It is almost guaranteed you will reach your intended target audience, as long as you choose the right influencer to work with. Choosing an influencer involves several steps: look at their social accounts, see if they\u2019re interacting with followers and have a positive following. Be sure to check and see if their tone matches your brand and mission \u2013 it\u2019s important to work with someone that seems like a natural fit.\r\rAudiences can immediately tell if a product doesn\u2019t match what other things the influencer is typically supporting. It\u2019s imperative that the influencer\u2019s message doesn\u2019t seem forced and they\u2019re genuinely happy to talk about your product.\rWhich kind of strategy should you use?\rBoth content and influencer marketing are successful strategies and have been proven to work. In the end, choosing one depends on what you are trying to promote.\r\rFor example, if you\u2019re trying to spread the word about a new product launch, influencer marketing is a great way to go. If you\u2019re just trying to promote your brand or message to a larger market, content marketing techniques such as blogging or interviews would be a good choice. If you can\u2019t decide, try both! Marketing is an important tool for all companies, and it wouldn\u2019t hurt to learn about all forms and incorporate each into your business plan.\r\r&nbsp;\r\r[et_pb_section global_module=\"9125\"][/et_pb_section]",

        "text": "Why Storytelling is a Powerful Strategic Business Tool Our purchasing decisions, on a daily basis, are affected by the kind of personality that a brand has cultivated for itself and how we relate to the values it embodies. Of course, the product/services the brand offers factors in too, but the role of a strong brand-customer relationship cannot be overlooked.\r\rThat\u2019s why storytelling is a powerful strategic business tool, because, more often than not, it is through the stories that brands tell that we decide how we feel about them.\r\rStorytelling allows brands to experiment with their creativity and write content that are like short stories. Be it your blog or a thoroughly researched article, you can weave a personal narrative or stories of other people into them to make your content interesting.\r\rSuch content creates intrigue and engages readers, and the stories help brands build a relationship with the customers. Brands can then reinforce that relationship by living up to their word\u2014and, of course, with the quality of their product or service\u2014to ensure brand loyalty.\r\rStories can be a powerful tool in any given situation, and the business sector isn\u2019t immune to the magical powers of storytelling. Today, social sharing, social media marketing, and content marketing are big parts of a business\u2019s promotional strategy, and storytelling is at the very core of these tools.\r\rStories are a perfect way to create a personality for your brand, make sure your readers remember you, and to inspire potential customers to make actual purchases.\rStorytelling Helps Brands Depict What Values They Embody\rThere are thousands of brands out there in any industry. How, in this case, do brands create a personality for themselves that stands out from their competitors and that users can relate to?\r\rThrough storytelling.\r\rConsider this for a second.\r\rIf you are showcasing and promoting your personal brand on your website or blog, would people want to know what you believe in?\r\rDefinitely.\r\rFrom sharing what you believe in, to what incidents made you imbibe certain values in your personal and professional life goes a long way in cultivating your own unique personality.\r\rThanks to social media and a plethora of business blogs that allow customers to follow companies and their work regularly, people expect these businesses to have their stories too. And through the power of stories, brands can establish clearly what their core values and mission are.\rWarby Parker: socially conscious eyewear\rTake, for example, Warby Parker, an eyewear brand that sells quality glasses at affordable prices. Their story speaks of how the company was born when as students one of them had to go a whole semester without glasses, living his life surrounded by blurry images.\r\rThey wanted to be able to see the world clearly without having to empty their bank accounts and wished to offer a solution to other people too.\r\rThe founders say that the company was founded \u2018with a rebellious spirit\u2019 and aims to offer \u2018designer eyewear at a revolutionary price\u2019 and forge the \u2018socially conscious business\u2019 path.\r\rTheir brand story incorporates their mission and the values that guide them, but that\u2019s not all it does.\r\rThey also create an image of themselves that would appeal to their target market. \u2018Rebellious\u2019 and \u2018socially conscious\u2019? Millennial consumers surely want to associate themselves with these values. This alignment between the brand\u2019s personality and the target\u2019s beliefs allows the brand to build a special bond of trust with its customers and stand out from its competitors.\r\rIf you want to create a unique personality for your brand, you have to tell people what values your company embodies, and the best way to do that is by telling stories.\r\r\rTug At The Heartstrings Through Storytelling\rResearch has shown time and again that in the post-truth era emotions usually win the battle against facts. Now, I am not asking you to lie to your consumers about your products. All I am saying is rather than making your product specifications the sole focus of your marketing efforts, try tugging at consumers\u2019 heartstrings through storytelling. According to a study, stories are up to 22 times more memorable than just facts.\rOliver Sacks: making neurology accessible through narrative\rThough it\u2019s not a business-related example, when it comes to storytelling, I can\u2019t help but mention the accomplished neurologist and colorful raconteur Oliver Sacks. He understood that it was important for medical journals and articles about complex brain functions to be accessible to the uninitiated. And he believed the best way to get the wider public interested in such complicated articles was to weave them into engaging narratives and stories.\r\rHe delivered complex neurological case studies in the form of quirky stories like \u2018The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat\u2019, \u2018The Music Never Stopped\u2019, and \u2018The Brain-Damaged Hare Krishna Who Believed He Had Reached Enlightenment\u2019, among other stories and books.\rBeyond your product\rSimilarly, when it comes to information about products and services, your readers are less likely to read complex product or service specifications. You need to have that info, but when it comes to converting website visitors into leads, stories about how your brand came to be, what drives your brand, and how it has touched lives are crucial.\r\rEvery platform available to you as a business\u2014be it your blog, website, your sales pitch, social media or your business plan\u2014is an opportunity to tell your story. When your story tugs at people\u2019s heartstrings, they are likely to remember your product and develop a personal connection with it.\r\rYour stories allow your customers to look beyond your product and see the people behind it.\r\rBrands like WeddingWire, a one-stop shop for couples planning their wedding, and DanniJo, a jewelry brand founded by two sisters, have hit the nail on the head when it comes to this.\r\rThrough an integrated approach, they use all digital platforms from Instagram to their website to podcasts to tell their stories in every possible format. Their posts don\u2019t only feature their products but also how they run their companies on a daily basis and how it has changed their lives.\r\rPeople\u2019s purchase decision is influenced by what brand they can remember. And businesses constantly use storytelling to elevate them above others and make their brand memorable. But for your stories to have the desired effect, you have to make sure your content is relevant and readable.\rBuild A Relationship With The Customers\rEmotive ads help humanize brands allowing them to foster a relationship with their customers.\r\rSharing the story of how you developed your brand on your \u2018About Us\u2019 page is a great way to distinguish yourself from your competitors.\r\rIf you offer digital marketing services, for example, and if you tell people only about products and services, your page is going to look the same as every other digital marketing firm\u2019s. On the contrary, if you tell people how you came to set up your business, you will trigger their interest.\r\rIf your customers can relate to certain aspects of your story\u2014about how you quit your day job to make your dream come to fruition, for example\u2014that\u2019s even better. They will see your brand as a reflection of themselves and build a relationship with it.\r\rHigh Brew Coffee\u2019s page tells the story of how the founder decided to set up a company to sell cold brew coffee when he went on a rafting trip through the Caribbean.\r\rThe stories, however, don\u2019t have to be limited to just the founders. Storytelling is an even more effective tool when the stories are coming from people whose lives the brand has changed in ways big or small.\r\rThe best example for this is Krochet Kids, a non-profit that produces high-quality, affordable apparel. The company believes in telling not just their own stories but also the stories of their producers. The items come with labels signed by the person who produced them, and customers can go to the person\u2019s profile and read their stories.\r\rThat\u2019s a great way Krochet Kids shows customers that it cares about people who are associated with the brand. These stories also help build a connection between individual producers, who work so hard to make the products, and the end-users.\rFinal Thoughts\rWith more and more platforms available to brands to tell their stories on, storytelling has taken on a new life. While it did seem like storytelling was going to be outmoded, different kinds of storytelling content are still being used to create a cohesive brand narrative and connect with potential customers. And storytelling has proven to be a powerful strategic business tool.\r\rWhy? Because everyone loves stories\u2014be it a fable about a hero who slew a monster or about how your brand\u2019s belief in equal opportunity helped changed someone\u2019s life.\r\rThese stories touch our hearts and urge us to act. Storytelling, thus, is a perfect tool to create a personality for your brand, make sure viewers remember you, and to inspire potential customers to make actual purchases.\r\r&nbsp;\r\r[et_pb_section global_module=\"9168\"][/et_pb_section]",

        "text": "Automating content marketing for WordPress, a chat with Ruth Ravent\u00f3s Content marketing is a popular strategic approach, but it takes time and a lot of efforts. Automating as much as you can content creation, optimization, and distribution can be key to success. We discussed this topic with Ruth\u00a0Ravent\u00f3s, one of the co-founders of Nelio Software.\rIf you don't come from Mars in the world of marketing, you've probably heard about content marketing \u2014 and, probably, you've even experimented it with your organization. If so, you probably know that creating content in order to drive lead generation and sales is not effortless.\r\rIt takes time, creativity, research, money, and the ability to measure your results, just like any other marketing approach.\r\rNevertheless, 91% of B2B and 86% of B2C\u00a0marketers are relying on content marketing according to a research\u00a0published this year by Content Marketing Institute and MarketingProfs and sponsored by Brightcove.\rWhat is content marketing and why it's such a big deal?\r\"Content marketing is a strategic marketing approach focused on creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and retain a clearly defined audience \u2014 and, ultimately, to drive profitable customer action.\"\rContent Marketing Institute\r\rContent marketing is an excellent way to\u00a0build your own\u00a0audience. When your brand shares valuable content, people are more likely to trust it. And trust is like a magic glue that makes your audience stick with you.\rAre blogs worth for content marketing?\rThe same research mentioned above, states that 79% of marketers use blogs to distribute their content\u00a0\u2014 and, even more importantly, 60% of the most successful marketers think that a blog is one of the most effective formats.\r\rWhen it comes to blogging, there is no CMS like WordPress. But, even if WordPress simplifies a lot the editing and publishing process, you still need to organize, optimize, distribute, and promote your content through different channels to reach your audience.\r\rHere is why we decided to ask a few questions to\u00a0Ruth Ravent\u00f3s, who created two WordPress plugins\u00a0to make content marketing easier and is truly devoted to this approach.\rA chat with Ruth Raventos, co-founder at Nelio Software\rYou are one of the co-founders of Nelio Software and a Ph.D. in Software Engineering. Talk me about your background: how did you find yourself interested in content marketing?\rRuth Raventos - Co-founder at Nelio Software\r\rAfter finishing my degree I started working as a software developer. But I was attracted to the academic world, so I did my Ph.D. and became a teacher and researcher of topics related to information systems development. \r\rHowever, I like challenges and in 2013 my partners, David Aguilera, Antonio Villegas, and I chose to leave the comfort of a good stable job and build our own startup, Nelio Software. We didn\u2019t have a concrete project in mind yet, just a vague idea of creating a scalable service. What service? How would we do it? We didn\u2019t know, but we were super thrilled about running our own business\u2026 so, who cares, right?\r\rIn the end, we decided we would work within the WordPress ecosystem and would develop plugins. We started brainstorming a lot of alternatives related to WordPress. In the end, we came up with two different projects that shared one vision: making WordPress sites more impactful.\u00a0\r\rAnd from there, our interest in content marketing came naturally.\rYour company developed two different plugins for WordPress, Nelio Content, and Nelio A/B Testing. What needs are you trying to solve for your customers?\rNelio Content features an editorial calendar and a content assistant. It has been designed to help you to efficiently create, schedule, and promote the content of your blog by automatically creating social publications on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, Instagram, and Pinterest. Focus on the content that works best with its built-in analytics, and run a successful blog while saving tons of time.\r\rhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SzwJQ55jus&amp;feature=youtu.be\r\rNelio A/B Testing is a powerful and versatile conversion optimization service for WordPress. It helps you define, manage, and keep track of A/B-testing experiments, combined with powerful and beautiful heatmaps.\r\rWith Nelio A/B Testing you can create alternatives to titles, featured images and excerpts without the help of designers and developers. Nelio A/B Testing will tell you which ones keep traffic on your site.\rHow did you understand that there was room for your plugins within the WordPress environment and market? \u00a0\rThe idea of plugins came from our own needs as web owners. We had a clear idea of what we wanted for ourselves. From there, we made an in-depth analysis of the plugins and other similar tools that existed in the market and their popularity. It seemed to us that there was a market and, at the same time, they could be improved in many ways to have a much greater impact. And that\u2019s it; we started with the development of an MVP for each one.\rTalking about WordPress, you are part of the organization of the upcoming WordCamp Barcelona. Why do you think it's crucial for the community to stick together?\rBeing part of this community has been critical to our success. It allows you to meet other interesting product developers, with whom to share your\u00a0experience. An open source community is a great place to learn new things and grow as a professional, especially when you\u2019re getting started and you don\u2019t know exactly where you\u2019re headed.\r\rAs you progress and become a better professional, you can\u2019t help giving something back. Our first contact with the community was like everybody else\u2019s \u2014 we attended a few meetups, talk to the organizers, met people\u2026 but as soon as we felt more confident and identified we too had a story to tell, we quickly got involved with the organization. Keep in mind these communities are volunteer-driven, so it\u2019s very important that everybody who can and cares gets involved!\r\r\rYou often write content on your blog... do you ever struggle with SEO?\rI've always been surprised at how many people present themselves as SEO experts. For us, the only formula that has worked so far is to improve our positioning in a totally organic way thanks to the regularity and constancy of the post published in our blog and their automatic promotion in social networks with Nelio Content\u2026\r\rBut yes, SEO is anything but easy. So far, we\u2019ve been focused on following the best practices everybody talks about (links, tags, keyword management, and so on) and we\u2019ve recently integrated your plugin, WordLift, to our content marketing strategy, hoping it\u2019ll help us rank even better.\rDo you think content organization can make a substantial difference in engaging your readers and, at the end of the day, converting them into customers?\rFor us, it has been key. Our experience is that with no advertising budget, but with great planning in creating content and seeing what is working best for us on our website, we have been able to create our current business. In fact, the use of our two products has helped us grow and make a difference.\rIf you had to sum up your experience in content marketing in three tips, what would they be?\rContent marketing is based on the generation and promotion of content. Therefore, the creation of a blog is the starting point for any online communication strategy of any professional or company. A blog with quality content helps you improve the visibility of your brand, it is the key factor to generate leads and, of course, the best way to improve your SEO. However, from our experience, a blog requires a lot of sacrifice and perseverance. Therefore, my recommendation to make this trip more bearable would be:\rFirst, have a topic that you\u2019re passionate about. \rThis way, it\u2019ll be easier for you to write quality content. You'd better like what you write about or you'll soon leave it aside.\u00a0\rSecond, be consistent.\rYou may not be the best writer in the world or you may not always choose the best topics possible, but if you persevere and, whatever happens, continue to publish content, you'll eventually get better than most.\rFinally, be as much as efficient as possible in the entire content generation process and its promotion.\rAutomate as many tasks as you can and don't waste time doing work that doesn't give you value. Tools like WordLift or Nelio Content will help you to save a ton of time.\r\r\r\r\r\r\rTalking with Ruth has been really inspiring and I'm sure you'll find much interesting content on Nelio blog too, check it out!\r\r\r\r\r\r",

        "text": "Google Voice Search Button is Dead, long live the Google Assistant! It's been subtle and first reported by the Android Police a few hours ago: Android devices used to have a\u00a0microphone button on the home screen widget along with the same button on the Google app itself to trigger a voice search and a list of supported commands (i.e. making phone calls, playing music and texting friends). This button is now being replaced by the Google Assistant and by the Actions supported by the Google Assistant app.\rWhy is the switch from Voice Search to the Google Assistant so important?\rThe introduction of Google Assistant shows us how Google is moving toward an \"AI-first\" user experience and it is\u00a0getting closer to achieving the true underlying potential of its large semantic network that consistently changes the way we search and consume information. We are looking at the surface of this changes when for instance the\u00a0Zero-Result SERP was\u00a0first introduced.\r\rThe red microphone button that previously triggered a simple voice search can now - with the Google Assistant - help us accomplish a lot more tasks including actions implemented in third-party applications that offer services in a variety of different sectors. We recently analyzed the new directory that Google created to help users discover third-party\u00a0Assistant actions and here is a breakdown of the top categories by the number of intents.\r\r\rHow did this happen?\rOn the latest Android devices running the Google Assistant, the Voice Search was causing an inconsistent user experience and\u00a0it was hard to grasp why one voice search was popping up from the bottom of the screen why another one was coming from the top.\u00a0\rHow can I optimize\u00a0content for the Google Assistant?\rOnline publishers can make their content ready for the Google Assistant by adding support for AMP and the adequate\u00a0structured data markup. The first types of structured content - for US publishers only - that the Google Assistant is able to pick up include Podcast, News, and Recipes.\u00a0Moreover, publishers can create their own Google Action (read more about it in this article on how to create your own Action or contact us to learn more).\r\r\r\rIt's important to move forward in this direction as we are starting to see divergent results from traditional Search and the Google Assistant.\r\rLet me show you an example - the query \"What is Semantic SEO?\" when triggered from Chrome (Voice Search) will trigger a featured snippet generated from the website online-sales-marketing.com but, when the same question is asked to the Google Assistant, (or to a Google Home or Google Mini device) the response\u00a0is scraped from the wordlift.io website.\r\rWhat is Semantic SEO - Google Assistant responds with the content from the wordlift.io website\r\r&nbsp;\r\rThere is more, if you create your own Google Action, the Google Assistant might suggest your Action to the end-user for answering a specific question (you can find out more on the WooRank's website\u00a0to optimize your Google Action for increasing its reach).\r\rSee an example below where our Google Action is invoked to provide information about WordLift.\r\r\rReady to optimize your content for the Google Assistant?

        "text": "Bing launches new AI-driven Intelligent Search Features Bing is starting to provide, across the world,\u00a0a brand new\u00a0Intelligent Search\u00a0features for its SERP, powered by AI, to provide immediate answers with a new and comprehensive look and feel. In this article we're presenting few tests of the new search capabilities and some guidelines on how to improve the visibility of your content on Bing.\r\rBing, with the help of\u00a0machine reading-comprehension and\u00a0deep neural networks,\u00a0is aggregating facts from well-known data sources to provide end-users with enough confidence on the information being displayed on its\u00a0search results.\r\rLet's start with an example based on\u00a0a super simple Ego Search about myself. This panel has been around for sometimes in the US but it is now richer and it can be accessed also (when the language\u00a0is set to English) from other countries.\r\rIn this specific example, the data is sourced from LinkedIn, Crunchbase and the good old Freebase. Now these are exactly the same webpages (and the datasets in the case of Freebase) that I reference in the entity about myself that is used to annotate articles on this blog. This is why, I assume that Bing, is using structured data to detect relevant\u00a0data sources around entities.\rKnowledge Panels\u00a0\rHere is how Bing can help you boost your personal branding\u00a0\u00a0\r\rHere is how Bing can help your customers find out more about your company\u00a0\rBelow the knowledge panel that Bing has created around the entity WordLift.\r\r\rInstant Answers\rBing is using a\u00a0machine reading comprehension\u00a0technology, backed by what they call\u00a0Project Brainwave, to generate the equivalent of Google's Featured Snippets by analyzing billions of web pages\u00a0to provide users with the answer they are looking for.\r\rLet's try with a couple of queries to see what Bing knows about WordLift. Let's ask in the first place -\u00a0\"What is WordLift?\"\u00a0\r\rInstant Answer on Bing for \"What is WordLift?\"\r\r...and then let's get even more specific with a query like \"What is an entity in WordLift?\"\u00a0 As you can see,\u00a0results - on these very narrow queries - are indeed very impressive!\r\rInstant Answer on Bing for \"What is an entity in WordLift?\"\rMore helpful in understanding facts about the world\rBing is also providing more ways to read facts about the world. We saw in December last year the new Perspectives\u00a0Answer Box around highly debated topics like Coffee as well the new Question &amp; Answer panel.\r\r\r\rNow, as announced by Bing a few days ago, answer boxes also feature a descriptive tooltip for complex terms that appear in the text of the answer. Have a look at the example below where the term\u00a0\"Liter\" is explained when highlighting the word\u00a0\"microliter\".\r\r\rIntelligent image search\rA lot has been done also to improve the image search of Bing that now uses a built-in object detection algorithm or let the user pick up a specific detail of the image with a manual crop. This really makes images way more interactive. See below an example of a photo where Bing is highlighting the two subjects.\r\rThe automatic object detection of Bing for images\r\r2018 is definitely the year when publishing data becomes a business imperative as search engines become truly capable of providing direct answers rather than a set of web results. In this context,\u00a0Bing\u00a0is bringing significant innovations in the search\u00a0industry by leveraging on\u00a0machine reading-comprehension and\u00a0deep neural networks.\r\r\rNeedless to say we're particularly keen on following how search engines are starting to use artificial intelligence and how semantic rich structured data\u00a0help them improve their services and in return, can help publishers improve their online visibility.\rRead\u00a0the full history of the SERP\u00a0to learn how search engines had become capable of answering questions using natural language.\rHow to optimize your content for Bing's Intelligent Search Features\rNow let's have a look at what we learned from these experiments to help you get the best out of\u00a0Bing's latest update.\r1. Start using Bing Webmaster tool\rIt has been significantly improved and there is a lot that you can do to ensure proper indexation from Bing,\u00a0to measure search traffic and even to improve the user experience on your website by using Bing-powered interactive widgets. Bing, with these widgets, works quite similarly like WordLift. It uses NLP to analyze the content of your webpage and adds an interactive widget using data from its graph. It's a ground breaking feature and I'll get deeper on it in the next blog post. For the time being you can preview it by visiting this example webpage.\r2. Curate your entities\rIn the web of data, information is scattered across multiple websites and it can be analyzed and reconciled to provide a more comprehensive overview of a person, a company or a product. By curating your profile on LinkedIn, for instance, or on trusted websites like Crunchbase, GitHub or Stackoverflow you are actually publishing relevant\u00a0data that Bing can effectively re-use in its knowledge panel.\r3. Use structured data to help Bing reconcile content with data\rAs seen in these initial experiments we're conquering a significant estate on personal keywords, branded keywords as well as questions related to our product. As algorithms start to analyze more in details the content that you have published using linked metadata and the schema.org vocabulary\u00a0you can help search engines properly disambiguate these entities to find relevant information across multiple data sources and websites.\u00a0By publishing articles under my name with a direct reference - in the metadata of these articles - to my LinkedIn profile I am helping\u00a0Bing (and the other semantic search engines) reconcile and connect the content I write with the data that describes me.\rRemain up to date with the latest news from Microsoft by visiting windowsreport.com.\rTry WordLift for FREE and get in touch to improve the search visibility of your website!",

        "text": "Bing has confirmed to use the JSON-LD Schema markup While in the official documentation of Bing still appears as if they prefer more\u00a0Microdata and RDFa formats,\u00a0Bing has now confirmed that:\r\r \tthey are using JSON-LD to interpret and analyze\u00a0web pages\r \tthey are preparing a verification tool to help webmasters check the schema.org markup that will also support the JSON-LD format\r\rBing has been a founding member of the\u00a0schema.org initiative along with Google, Yandex, and Yahoo! to help webmaster markup their content using a shared data schema.\r\rWe've been intercepting and sharing, along with other Semantic SEO lovers, the following tweet from Jon Henshaw, Senior SEO analyst for CBS Interactive:\r\rhttps://twitter.com/henshaw/status/969715635143004160\r\rAnd today the confirmation arrived also from Christi Olson Head of Evangelism at Bing via\u00a0@MichelleRobbins\u00a0who published an article on\u00a0@sengineland.\r\r&nbsp;\r\u201cYes, Bing does support JSON-LD.\u201d Christi said.\rWhat is schema markup?\rSchema markup is metadata that you add to your website to help search engines provide more informative results for their users.\r\rBefore the arrival of schema.org back in 2011 (the initiative started in June and Yandex joined in November of the same year), there were way too many standards for marking up different types of content on web pages. While the variety of different vocabulary still exists and it is of a great value for the scientific, the academic and the librarian communities it was of little or no help for commercial search engines.\r\rAs a result of the diversity of languages, it was difficult for webmasters to decide on the most relevant and supported markup standards to use.\r\rCreating a schema shared and supported by all the major search engines made it very easy for webmasters to add markup, and in return made it easier for search engines to create a better user experience for their users (with all different sort of enriched results, knowledge panels and other semantic powered goodies of the SERP).\r\r",

In the industry of\u00a0real estate investing,\u00a0Remida focuses on\u00a0house flipping in Florida, USA\u00a0and - in a few months - it developed an efficient content marketing strategy, that allowed the company to get in touch with new investors through the website.Investing in the American real estate market is an enticing idea,\u00a0but to do it properly you need to be guided by real estate professionals, who can help each investor identifying the best opportunities and the best strategies.This is the very mission of Remida Holding.In a way, the partners of the company \u2013 Daniele, Massimo, Augusto, and Mirco \u2013 embody the well-known American dream, a dream that only realizes itself for those who work hard and are fully resolute. After an almost-casual beginning,\u00a0the company saw a strong growth, that led them to\u00a0structure, in a few years, a company that manages 100 estates at the same time\u00a0and an internal organization of professionals who cooperate to offer an end-to-end service - from buying to sales, rehabs included.Meet the founder, Daniele Zampa\u00abI've started in 2011, with a personal investment\u00a0on some rentals. It was a positive moment for the Rental market, since buying prices were still quite low because of the famous subprime loans crisis. In some cases and areas, real estates lose\u00a0 \u2013 75% of their value.\u00bb That's how\u00a0Daniele Zampa,\u00a0Founder and Operations Director of\u00a0Remida Holding, tells the beginning of his real estate adventure in the USA: thanks to a personal investment in a positive moment, he - without knowing - laid the foundation of his own company.\u00abMeanwhile, the market went back to the normal values allowing other kinds\u00a0of investments which produce much more profits. Every stage of the market has an ideal\u00a0strategy. Experience and skills allowed us to be ready to fast-adaptation. Since 2011 we managed something like $15,000,000 real estate operations with our own local organization, employees,\u00a0work facilities, one office in St. Petersburg and another in\u00a0Rome.\u00bbBut... how do you build such a big\u00a0company starting from a personal investment? We asked Daniele to unveil us how did they get so far.\u00abThe first secret to success is perseverance. Out of the theoretic world, this is not a simple market: reality has many shades and variables. Only perseverance and hard work can help you overcome obstacles and barriers, together with the ability to learn from feedbacks.\u00bb Daniele says, and then adds:\u00a0\u00abOne of the key building blocks of our success is the team we've hired. The very point is to put together good guidelines and great people who follow them and improve our business everyday. Recently we've started investing in our image and in the digital marketing operations to promote our services.\u00bbAnd this brings us back to:\u00a0why did you choose to redesign your website and to adopt content marketing?\u00a0What are your goals?\u00abThe reason why we decided to invest in content marketing is that we've realized that we've really built something big. Today we are one of the main\u00a0players in the Real Estate market in\u00a0Tampa Bay\u00a0and now it's time to show our potential to a broader audience. We know everything about the area where we work and we have contacts with all the key personalities who really move the real estate market in Tampa Bay. Shortly: we have grown a lot and with this growth came the need to use marketing to\u00a0show our skills and describe our professional way of working to potential clients and investors.\u00bbContent marketing, a winning strategyRemida uses its website as a channel to reach three goals:consolidate and structure the relationship with clients, who can find on the website updates and data about\u00a0each operation they are following;support the relationships with new potential investors,\u00a0who can find on the website all the general information\u00a0 that they need;last, but not least, help the company to take the leap from casual word-of-mouth to digital marketing and\u00a0meet a broader audience in Italy and in the world, getting in touch with new potential investors who daily look for\u00a0real estate opportunities in the USA.Talking about marketing, the work on the website's content was crucial:\u00a0it allowed the website to gain a dramatic increase in visits from the organic search with a consequential increase of contact requests by real estate investors.What kind of strategy has been applied?Back in august 2016, the website remidaholding.com was completely restyled\u00a0and, then, their online presence was consolidated creating new content, to serve to their audience simple and clear explanations that can fit their knowledge needs.At this point,\u00a0Remida met Wordlift\u00a0and decided to use this tool to\u00a0improve its content strategy through artificial intelligence applied to SEO and the creation of a vocabulary\u00a0of strategic entities in Remida's industry.Leveraging on the\u00a0semantic organization of the\u00a0content, Remida shares knowledge and interesting articles that could be\u00a0useful for potential clients who are trying to get deeper into some topics related to real estate.The\u00a0real estate technical jargon\u00a0is the basis of Remida's vocabulary, and represents the knowledge that is needed as\u00a0to understand this industry.\u00a0The entities are truly useful to users that are first approaching the real estate markets, they have been connected to the articles, enriching them with learning opportunities.To\u00a0monitor competitors and analyze ranking improvements\u00a0for the most important keywords and concepts, Remida chose the Professional Subscription, which combines WordLift's AI and the\u00a0technical SEO audit by WooRank.What about results? Find out how traffic and leads growOrganic traffic from march 2016, until todayBefore August 2016, Remida's website was essential and very simple. The organic traffic was quite fragmentary: you could observe few peaks and long periods without a single visit.Thanks to the continuous work of content creation, management and organization and to the implementation of the entity-based content model through WordLift, the organic traffic of the website grew considerably bringing new leads. In the screenshot below, you can how the traffic from organic search improved between January, when WordLift was first installed, and September of this year.WordLift effect on RemidaIf you consider the last four months, 55% of leads come to the website from search engines. A result that was impossible at first, without offering valuable content through a content strategy specifically designed for those who want to invest in the USA market from Italy.Thanks to content and to its outreach strategy, Remida was contacted by several clients who were interested to make considerable investments in the project.\u00a0To guess the value of a single lead in this specific market, just consider that investments start at $40.000 and can exceed $500.000.The digital strategy of Remida Holding combines paid and organic trafficAn accurate content marketing strategy allowed Remida to gain more visibility: you can have a better idea, looking at the improvements to the rankings of some keywords which are strategic for the business. In less than one year, Remida reached the first positions\u00a0for some research queries.This graph shows the improvements of the rankings for one of the main keywords. Source: WooRank.Wrap up and key learningsJust a few months after they started working on content, Remida and its team decided to use WordLift to boost its content marketing: for this reason, it has been possible to observe the effects of every tactic and to spot the successful content which engaged potential clients most.Here are three key learnings that can be useful for those who work in communication and marketing in the real estate industry and are thinking about designing a content marketing strategy.Valuable content is those that better respond to the specific needs of actual and potential customers: before writing a new article, think who can be interested in reading it.While thinking and writing content, try to imagine possible learning paths for your readers starting from the blog post. Basic concepts can become new entities and enrich the reading experience.Articles and entities written in these months form an accessible knowledge base that can be capitalized in terms of traffic even in those periods when you can't publish new ones.Are you thinking about using content marketing for your real estate business?\u00a0Start using WordLift\u00a0and let artificial intelligence help you![/et_pb_text][/et_pb_column][/et_pb_row][/et_pb_section]",

        "text": "Build Your Own Graph and Make Your Website Talk Findability really is a key topic these days if you work with content and if you\u2019re wondering how to leverage on conversational UIs and&nbsp;artificial intelligence.Whether you are creating content that can easily be picked up by Personal Digital Assistant like Google Assistant, Cortana or Amazon Echo or you\u2019re developing your own AI to power a chatbot over Facebook Messenger, you are indeed working to make your content more accessible and easier to be found.Findability is about creating a context and guiding the user to make their next move into the funnel.Every day we read about a new chatbot trying to achieve miraculous results and behind these low-level (or narrow) AIs there is always content playing its magic. Content is essential in many ways and typically comes in three forms: \tdata that the chatbot needs to answer a specific question (\u201chow old is Andrea Volpini?\u201d) \ta content card that can bring the user one step closer to the target (i.e. the landing page of a product or an explanatory article on how the ledger works in a blockchain) \ta media asset (an infographic or a video when the device has a display or an audio content).When creating a conversation UI the structure is always the same and it\u2019s made of a scenario, some intents, a context and\u2026 knowledge (the content part).The scenario depicts the user in a specific condition (i.e. training for my next race, waiting for a connecting flight at the airport or spending time by looking at the ceiling). Each scenario is defined by a series of potential intents (or requests), typically organized in a tree structure (i.e. \u201cwhat is my pace right now? ok, when will I complete this training session then?\u201d or \u201cwhen is boarding on my next flight starting? Is the flight on time?\u201d).The intents are all the things that the user might ask during the interaction with the chatbot, the context is everything being said until that point plus other contextual variables such as the type of device being used, the capability of the device (ie there is a screen to render a web page or it can also play videos) the location of the user and so on.The knowledge needs to be exposed with a set of APIs and somehow is connected to your content management system. After all a chatbot, in most cases, is just another entry point and/or, in many cases, is the only chance to engage with users trapped in the flow of their social media streams.Marketing is really about efficiency and if you are planning to make your content smarter to prepare for voice search, you can really plan to re-use the same content and the same metadata also for building your own chatbot.The 6 steps to make your website talkLet me give you an example to walk you through the 5 steps required to prepare your content for voice search and AI-driven experiences.1. Choose an intent that you want to addressAs I was preparing the content for the Main Street ROI&nbsp;Webinar with Nils De Moor (CTO and co-founder of WooRank) I looked at recurring questions that I personally have after choosing a Webinar that I\u2019m interested in and I picked one: \u201cWhen is the webinar on xyz?\u201d.This is the typical long tail question (made of 6 words with all articles and propositions in the text - as expected from this type of voice search queries) that I would keep on asking before an event.Typically Who/What/How questions are more generic than When/Where questions. A \u201cWhen\u201d question, implies that the person is already convinced to attend the webinar, whether when someone is asking a \u201cWho\u201d question (like \u201cWho is Andrea Volpini?\u201d) he or she might still be evaluating the quality of the event.2. Provide the answer using structured datahttps://youtu.be/9mH8ARo2G_kMake sure that, when possible, the structured data behind your pages are providing the answer unambiguously. For a \u201cWhen\u201d that is referred to an event (and a webinar is indeed an online event), using the schema.org vocabulary we can use a specific property that indicates the starting time of the event. It\u2019s called startTime and it can be expressed using date times in UTC format. This information shall be available on the page of the event (the webinar page on my site) but it can also be injected in other articles where I\u2019m mentioning this upcoming webinar. At the metadata level, every concept like our event will have its own unique ID to ensure consistency in the data across multiple web pages (or even multiple websites). So every time I\u2019m mentioning the webinar I can add a reference to the unique ID of the event in my linked data graph and I can repurpose the startDate.The importance of Rank Zero resultsSince the introduction of the Featured Snippets in 2014, Google is trying to answer to users\u2019 searches with quick organic answers and not only with the list of links we used to see before.These answers are the so-called Rank Zero results: they are composed by an extracted answer (which takes data from other websites around), a display title and an URL. Sometimes they happen to be enriched with images, tables, bulleted lists and more.Thanks to their position on the SERP, Rank Zero results tend to have a very high CTR.&nbsp;3. Build content around your answer to provide a contextWe want to prepare content that fits into a specific moment (or micro-moments as Google would call it). It\u2019s clear that we need to provide an immediate answer in some cases (i.e. a \u201cWhen\u201d question demands a clear date in the response) but at the same time, we want to entice the user to find out more. We need a narrative that brings additional value to our users.We do it all the time when we converse among humans.One asks a question, and while providing the answer the other moves the conversation one step ahead by adding more details. The same applies to human-to-computer interactions. While you expect an answer you are also usually happy to discover more semantically related content that gravitates around your primary request.To do so I created a very simple content model that was indeed informed by the same schema.org vocabulary that search engines use to describe online content. It\u2019s called entity-based content model and the principle is simple:Everything is an entity (a data point describing a thing that exists in the real world with all its attributes), every entity has a corresponding web page and entities are connected one to another in a meaningful way - yes, you get to decide, in your graph, what connects to what.The pillar content sits at the center of the diagram, this is the main page that describes the event with all its corresponding properties (as seen above for, the startDate it is one of them). Linking to and/from here there are other entities and their equivalent web pages. An entity-page about the host of the webinar Scott Abel, an entity-page related to voice search optimization and an entity-page for WordLift. These pages are considered \u201cCluster content\u201d - they provide both a context and a way to entice the user to discover more about the webinar.4. Page Load Time is a great SEO opportunityPageSpeed appears to play a major role in voice search SEO. The average voice search result page loads in 4.6 seconds.A Voice Search study by Backlinko on the importance of page speed.The relationship between website loading speed and voice search is pretty clear since the PageSpeed of the results has been analyzed from Backlinko. The result? The typical loading speed of a voice search result was much faster than most web pages&nbsp;(52% faster than the average page).People want Google's answers to be precise but also as fast as possible, an that also applies for Voice Search results.&nbsp;When you ask a question to your Personal Assistant, the answer should be fast: no one likes to wait for a&nbsp;device that lazily spits out an answer. Therefore, it\u2019s plausible that Google\u2019s voice search algorithm would use PageSpeed as a key ranking signal. So that's what you need to do: just make sure your site loads as quickly as possible.5. Make sure that both the answer and the content are easily accessible via APIsWhen using WordLift a semantic layer is added to your pages that transforms them into entity-pages (this means that a corresponding data point is created off-page and it is referenced on-page using structured data markup and a specific format called JSON-LD). This layer can be accessed by crawling each page (search engines, fact-checking bots crawl your page, look at the metadata and, when available, process it to gain more information about the page). A file with all the metadata is delivered asynchronously using the JSON format and it is accessible in a programmatic way. Just to give you an example if you run from your terminal window this command:curl 'https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php' \u2026 --data 'action=wl_jsonld&amp;id=5175'You are going to receive the metadata that describes the page about the webinar from our website with all its corresponding properties.Above you can see the graph visualization of the JSON-LD file created by WordLift for the Webinar (the graph is built by the JSON-LD playground and you can explore it from here)This is extremely useful if you know from your CMS what page contains the information you need and it\u2019s fairly easy to use if you know your way around JSON parsing. This simple JSON-LD file also includes a reference to all the other entity-pages that might be used in the conversation (i.e. the entity-page about Scott Abel, the entity-page on voice search optimization and the entity-page about WordLift).6. Develop a chatbot, stand out on search results or do both to plug your content into your favorite personal digital assistantAs your content is now semantically-rich and properly structured using the schema.org vocabulary you can basically connect with your audience in two ways: \tyou let search engines and personal assistants do their work and you hope to be featured on their voice-enabled results (competition here can be fierce as you can imagine) \tyou create your own intent for your own favorite personal digital assistant to make sure users will be able to interact with the content from your website.I succeeded in doing both. The enriched webinar page was featured as #1 result in Google for the intent that I was optimizing for. This also means that when the question was asked to the Google Assistant the webinar page was provided as the first result and you can see in the example below that the structured data has been essential in providing the user with the actual date of the webinar (as a nice side effect you can see the result had two links instead of just one).Findability in the era of Semantic SearchI also created a conversational experience for the Google Assistant using the data from the website along with API.AI, one of the many chatbot platforms, that helped me glue the intents, the context and package the answers. Here below a diagram of the workflow: the Messaging Platform, in this case, is the Google Assistant and API.AI is the NLP &amp; Bot framework that I used.Chatbots: a simple use-caseIn this way, starting from the same entity-based content model I was able to reach a wider audience and to give a new life to my content.If you\u2019re interested in knowing more about making your website talk, watch this 1-hour webinar with me&nbsp;and Nils from WooRank.

        "text": "Make the best out of your content with WordLift 3.15 Some of the content on your website truly represents the essence of your business and is designed to deliver your message to a broader audience. These authoritative pieces of content provide the best and most detailed description of a topic you care about.In WordLift, we call these articles entities. They are the quintessential, self-contained representation of the interests of your target audience. Entities provide a clear context to the reader and help you connect one article to another in a network of meanings.WordLifting a website is about building this semantic network between entities and articles in such a way that both humans and machines can get the best out of your writings. With WordLift 3.15, we have worked side-by-side with a highly opinionated group of experts to let you finally turn any of your existing content into entities with the simplicity of a click.Websites are micro-ecosystems within a broader oneIn a way or another,\u00a0all content pieces in a website are interconnected. Also, they are accessible from\u00a0multiple entry points: users come from organic search, advertising campaigns, social media, referrals, chatbots or even\u00a0QR codes that you placed somewhere in the physical world.In a corporate environment, content becomes\u00a0an extension of the organization. In a personal blog content is the\u00a0extension of the author's identity.In other words, a\u00a0web page is not just a web page: it is deeply interconnected with other pages inside and outside the website and within a broader ecosystem of shared meanings.In the era of ecosystems, seeing the big picture is more important than ever, and less likely. It\u2019s not simply that we\u2019re forced into little boxes by organizational silos and professional specialization. We like it in there. We feel safe. But we\u2019re not. This is no time to stick to your knitting. We must go from boxes to arrows. Tomorrow belongs to those who connect.Peter Morville, IntertwingledIf you organize your website and limit your thinking within the borders of your\u00a0pages, there will always be an external factor that will introduce a degree of entropy. Much like the virus that decimated dozens of wolves in the ecosystem of the\u00a0Isle Royale National Park, in Michigan, described by Peter Morville in the first chapter of his book, Intertwingled. If you don't identify your pillars, anything new will comprimise the overall structure.Instead, try to look at the big picture\u00a0and find the pillars of your website\u00a0and the\u00a0meaningful connections that constitute its soul.\u00a0And, of course, as your website grows, you will have to keep on building new pillars that are consistent with your editorial plan.Much like trying to imagine your website as a castle with aisles that connect rooms and other aisles: small rooms, huge ones... just like your site with cornerstones , articles and other features.The connections between pillar content and all the other articles and pages that you will write are the vectors that reshape the user experience of your readers.Look at your content and let WordLift do the restYou have to think twice and carefully choose the pieces of content that you consider strategic for your website.\u00a0These articles shall become entities and they will form your starting vocabulary (in WordLift all entities are grouped into a vocabulary of terms).Look at your content. I can easily guess that\u00a0many articles are strictly related to\u00a0the time when they have been published. Dig deeper. You will probably find some texts that have been written to explain a concept or to introduce the name - of a person, an organization, a place or an event that has a pivotal role in your editorial plan.The purpose of an article is to tell a new story or to express a point of view, an opinion. By contrast, when you write a piece of content to explain\u00a0something to your readers using\u00a0fact-based and evergreen information - much like an article in\u00a0Wikipedia - then your content should become an entity in WordLift.Now, look at your\u00a0content assets and answer\u00a0these three questions:are they meant to describe\u00a0relevant and recurrent concepts in your website?can they be\u00a0used to provide context around your articles? Can readers use them to better understand your texts?are they necessary to better understand the connections between other concepts in your vocabulary?If you can answer yes to at least one of these questions, then it's a good idea to turn these existing\u00a0articles or pages into\u00a0entities. They will become new\u00a0means to connect your other articles\u00a0through internal links and semantic recommendations.If you want to learn more about building your first vocabulary, don't miss this article that suggests the\u00a08 golden rules\u00a0to create a vocabulary with WordLift.[wl_navigator]A release developed with? and... with the help of our usersWordLift 3.15 brings a major change in the way users have experienced our plugin from the very beginning of their journey. To be honest we wouldn't have got to this point by ourselves, it would have been way too complicated: we are here thanks to the precious help and dedication of a selected pool of experts that pushed us to the limits and helped us build this new release.In the last months, WordLift has been chosen\u00a0to organize content of\u00a0large\u00a0editorial websites with hundreds of thousands of pages and a considerable amount of traffic (5M+ visits per month). These websites already had enough\u00a0content to define, describe and contextualize their core knowledge base. Whether it were articles or pages, it didn't make sense to create new pages to start up the\u00a0vocabulary that WordLift needs to structure the content. It was so much better for these users to\u00a0transform existing content\u00a0into entities.It was right in the middle of the summer when we decided to fly both Mark and David to Rome and we engaged with a selected group of highly opinionated\u00a0digital marketing pros for\u00a0a 2-day hackathon to explore how to organize vast websites with\u00a0WordLift's\u00a0entity based content model.[caption id=\"attachment_5987\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"1000\"] Our Dev &amp; Design team at work during the hackathon. From left to right: our UX Designer Claudio Salatino, our CTO David Riccitelli, and our developer Mark Kaplun[/caption]We collected the suggestions coming from experienced SEO consultants such as Mark Bryce Sharron and Roberto Serra, and we had the opportunity to talk about WordLift cold start problem\u00a0with the well-known Italian growth hacker and blogger Raffaele Gaito who gave us the most simple and precious\u00a0advice:\u00abGet out of your technical minds and embrace your users' point of view.\u00bbIn other words: simplify the life of your clients.We worked on WordLift 3.15 keeping his words in mind. As soon as the first prototype was ready we asked our long-time customer and friend\u00a0Rainer Edlinger to test it on his blog Whisky Circle. For many years,\u00a0Rainer has been writing premium content about world-famous spots in the Whisky sector and was passionately interested in turning these articles into entities. Thanks to Rainer we optimized the new search box that helps you linking your entities with equivalent entities in the linked data cloud.So, here we are:\u00a0WordLift 3.15 is ready and...you can take it for a test drive ?\u00a0 TRY IT FOR FREE. Here is how it works ?Build your Vocabulary with the Content you already haveTurning existing articles and pages into entities is super-easy. Just go to 'Edit' from any\u00a0article or page on your website and change 'Article' to the expected 'Entity type'.[caption id=\"attachment_5925\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"292\"] Turn your articles and pages into entities with one click[/caption]When you turn a piece of content into an entity, don't forget to curate it by adding the metadata WordLift needs to describe the entity to machines.One metadata that really pushes your entity rating up is the sameAs property\u00a0that allows to you connect your entity with other equivalent\u00a0entities in the web of data.Connect your entities with Linked Open Data using the sameAsWhen WordLift runs the analysis on your articles, it uses natural language processing to detect the relevant concepts and to connect them automatically with existing resources in the Linked Open Data cloud using the sameAs property.When you create a new entity from scratch or when you convert a blog post into an entity, you need to manually\u00a0add the\u00a0 sameAs property and this can be time-consuming. With WordLift 3.15 you can run a simple\u00a0search that traverses\u00a0different datasets to find the sameAs links that you need for your entity.In the metadata fields look for the sameAs field, start typing a keyword and match the corresponding entities. If you can't find anything, try to use a different keyword or a shorter one.

        "text": "Crafting Texts in the Age of Fragmented Reader Experience Entering the realm of cyberspace, reading and writing change, changing us and the way we perceive text. New modes of interacting with the written word emerge and further exist in brand new environments, across brand new digital surfaces and spaces.Given the bursts of thoughts and meaning exchange in the digital world, we as writers, are challenged to rethink reader experience and from there find answers to questions like: how can we write differently to meet our readers? where are we to meet our readers?The answer to each of the questions lies in thoroughly examining and understanding the moving parts of a fragmented, multi-channel reality. One of the rapidly unfolding narratives and living intertextuality. One where our readers are constantly distracted by notifications and have increasingly shrinking attention spans. A reality where content needs growing at electric speed.Talking about the fragmented reader's experience,the index below can help you navigate through this article.Cool, uh?Just click colored rectangle besides the names of the paragraphs on the left to skip to those passages, or click the ones besides the\u00a0entities on the right to better understand the main concepts behind this article.Readers and Writers: A Life in FragmentsDeconstructing the fragmented nature of today\u2019s reader experience is key to crafting texts that will connect us to audiences in a meaningful way. And the nature of today\u2019s reader very much resembles what Seneca described in one of his Moral Letters to Lucilius - On discursiveness in reading:...reading of many authors and books of every sort may tend to make you discursive and unsteady. You must linger among a limited number of master thinkers, and digest their works, if you would derive ideas which shall win firm hold in your mind. Everywhere means nowhere. When a person spends all his time in foreign travel, he ends by having many acquaintances, but no friends.The full text is available at II. On Discursiveness in ReadingFurther, the letter continues with Seneca arguing that \u201deating\u201d too much of a knowledge is \"cloying the consumer rather that nourishing them\".Similarly, a reader\u2019s experience with digital media, mostly the Web-based one, more often than not appears to be \u201cdevouring\u201d bits and pieces of fragmented content - a headline from Youtube here, a Facebook share from there, a piece of a Kindle book and a bit of a pdf, sent from a friend.Acknowledging the essence of such reader\u2019s experience can give us perspectives and understandings that will help us see and foresee what role our texts might play in such a fragmented environment. As writers, we are tasked to find the common thread in this cornucopia of content and present it to our readers giving them real food for thought and deep thinking. For time well-spent is one of the most valuable experience we can enrich the life of a reader with.\u201cThe story of a shattered life can be told only in bits and pieces\u201d, quotes Rilke, philosopher Zigmund Bauman.In cyberspace, our texts reach readers converging before their eyes in all possible shapes and forms, surfaced and discovered in all conceivable ways. That is why the texts we write are (or should be) like a kaleidoscopic mosaic, made of various chunks. Chunks that can live separately without looking as if they are not part of our narrative. Such kaleidoscope-like approach, where content pieces are designed as to be brought together and form any picture before the reader, is radiant with possibilities for readers and writers alike.Text on the Web: A Glorious Symphony of Interconnected Ideas, People and ThingsOn the Web, texts break boundaries and build networks, as glorious symphony of connected ideas, people and things. Our job as writers, diligently meeting our audience's needs, is to orchestrate this symphony - with our imagination and with a baton made of technology.Mixed with the right tools, our creativity would allow us to connect on as many levels as possible. For, remember, in a fragmented reader\u2019s reality we are tasked with finding that common thread that will help the person on the other side of the text see clearly through the noise. We should also keep in mind that in a multimodal interaction with our readers we are not only content creators but to also content curators: we need to be able to assemble meaningfully bits and pieces of texts across social media, email communication, forums and other digital spaces.To sum up, to orchestrate a good symphony, we need to: \tfind out what algorithmic audiences are all about (how and why they read us)seek to create a binding thread across devices, platforms and interactive systems through our writing.We can accomplish both with a single conceptual shot: if we allow ourselves to conceive of texts outside the website boundaries, that is to think of texts within the context of application, a personal assistant, a chatbot, a voice search environment.The Curious Case of the Networked Text in a Fragmented RealityIt is only when we as writers recognize and accept that we build worlds of words in an environment that pushes the limits of the written word outside the screen, that our messages will be able to make it to our recipients - on the other side of a screen or through the still awkwardly sounding robo voice of a personal assistant, the algorithms of which have just calculated the best answer for the user.Impressive problem solvers, algorithms have been around since Ancient times. The oldest algorithm, being the one of Euclides (a method for finding the greatest common divider), as Marcus du Sautoy explains in his wonderful movie: The Secret Rules of Modern Living: Algorithms.Very simply put, algorithms are \u201ca set of defined steps to produce particular outputs\u201d.Algorithms search, collate, sort, categorise, group, match, analyse, profile, model, simulate, visualise and regulate people, processes and places. They shape how we understand the world and they do work in and make the world through their execution as software, with profound consequences.Thinking critically about and researching algorithmsThat explained, algorithmic audiences are the audiences of various programs that consists of algorithms reading your text in various ways, for a number of reasons - to analyze them, to search through them, to process them and feed them in a larger system. And before we slip into the utopian future of a your vacuum robot reading for pleasure in their spare time, and you thinking about the best text to please it, let me brace you with this first understanding: algorithmic audiences are important and knowing about them will give you a valuable perspective. On one hand it is the human to human interaction that algorithms ultimately serve, on the other, they are still far from being true readers.The melonsI scolded him about last year,I now offer to his spirit.Oemaru (Blyth 1982)[...] this spare and lovely haiku, can we even say for sure what it tells us? So evocative to a person, surely an eternity will pass before a computer can extract its essence. Let\u2019s try something else.This haiku was written by Oemaru (a Japanese person), was translated by R.h. Blyth (a British person), and appears on page 763 in Blyth (1982). Which is volume three of a set of books entitled Haiku. [...]Yes, this is more like it. We can represent this kind of information to a computer - specific bits and pieces about something definite.Thomas B. Passin,\u00a0Explorer\u2019s Guide to the Semantic WebAs you can see, algorithmic audiences are nothing more than programs designed to make sense, to the extent possible, of our texts in order to better classify, distribute and serve them. Actually, algorithms can be also very helpful when creating content, as Andrea calls them (see WordLift for Digital Publishers and how to create an Open Database of Knowledge), the can be Our New Colleagues simply because they can interpret data and turn it into meaningful content.And when a substantial part of our work gets algorithmic helpers, i.e. gets automated, we will have the time and mind space to envisage new ways of interacting with our readers, and connecting with them through the power of words. For the courage of creation and the spirit of imagination will never be a question of automation.And this leads us to the second understanding I want to brace you with: the understanding of the value and the importance of a narrative.Electronic text is connected on many levels, it is literally a networked text. With its hyperlinks and the openness it exists within it has the potential to give the reader the full benefits of the digital experience. Among the most prominent from these benefits is the benefit of interconnectedness. On the Web, a text is to be connected to as many parts of its story: to related facts, to contextual details, to a network of ideas, people and to the other texts it is made of and exists in. It is to be a network itself. When it serves as a hub for all kind of related media, it also serves the purpose of being a part of a narrative, while simultaneously providing new experiences, new ways of interaction, new ways of content discovery.The Web Hitchhikers Guide to Thinking, Reading and WritingTo successfully create and nourish our relationships with our readers, hitchhiking, exploring and making the Web a better place to read in, we need to ask ourselves: What we can do for our readers to make their experiences rich and fulfilling?Take voice search, for example. A growing number of our readers are accessing websites via Google\u2019s voice search. So, there are a number of things we can do to make our texts suitable to be listened to.As you might have experienced already for yourself text is being increasingly rendered the form of an answer when searched for in Google. So, here, the implications for us as web authors are clear. We are to aim for:Clarity: Nothing new here. When writing content for the so-called informational searches, we are to use concise, neutral language and to straightforwardly answer questions. There\u2019s no need for verbosity, what the user needs is as much information packed in one sentence as possible.Reimagined interaction: This is where we need to imagine possible environments. We are to think about the most important information that a user would need to hear or see and the context they are going to be served that information in.Narratives built of content chunks: We need to be fusionists here. We are to be able to very well combine a text with other content pieces that we believe will best serve the content need of the user.For more practicalities, make sure to check Silvia\u2019s 5-step checklist to write effective content for voice search.And now, the hardest part, I am unwilling to skip: how do you write facts in a beautiful, engaging way. How do we combine them with the creative flow of our text, ultimately how do we present something dry in an immersive way?Fortunately, I don\u2019t know!The answers to all of these questions are a matter of your own thoughts, feelings, your own \u201csequence of decisions\u201d, your own intuition, and your own experience. It is up to you to envisage the interaction with the reader and craft the most appropriate piece to serve, delight and inspire them.What I know is that passion, imagination and the need to express yourself and connect with your readers will never be a question of algorithms or technology. They will always be a question of the web hitchhiker\u2019s hunch.And Now, Writers, Please Step Up to the Screenless World of Your ReadersAs revolutionary and novel this title may sound, I want to remind you something: solitary reading has not always been the primary way of \u201cconsuming\u201d a text. Back in Ancient times there were \u201creaders\u201d that read the text from a scroll to an audience. They did not have the neutral voice of the Kindle reader, reading you your ebook or the \u201cfaculty\u201d to search through text as fast as Google Voice Search, but they did have a similar role: to be a kind of a medium in this amazing process in which \u201cwe come to know a little more about the world and about ourselves to us individually, far away, and long ago\u201d, as Alberto Manguel puts it in the preface of his book A History of Reading.My point here is that no matter the medium our text reaches our readers through, be it a screenless environment or another \u201cshiny object\u201d, what counts is that we as writers are to be well-versed in this medium and at the same time not to be blinded by its features. We are to only use it as yet another vehicle for our writings to reach our audiences through the highway called intertwingularity.We are to just keep doing what we\u2019ve always done - weave webs of words, knowing that our message today is amplified on an unprecedented scale and in today\u2019s culture the fragmented reader experience is the yin of shared understanding and our networked texts are its yan.Wanna learn more?

        "text": "SEMANTiCS 2017: what happens when Artificial Intelligence meets SEO The vision of organizing content and creating - out of millions of web pages - a Giant Global Graph was groundbreaking. When Web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee\u2019s blogged about it back in 2007 it was clear that something was happening. Giant Global Graph\u00a0(GGG) really was a definition that he introduced to clarify how a\u00a0web of data was emerging\u00a0from the web of documents.\u00a0 \u00a0\rHe writes:\r\r\r\u00abSo the Net and the Web may both be shaped as something mathematicians call a Graph, but they are at different levels. The Net links computers, the Web links documents.\u00a0\rNow, people are making another mental move. There is realisation now, \"It's not the documents, it is the things they are about which are important\". Obvious, really.\u00bb\r\rLater he continues: \r\r\r\u00abThen, when I book a flight it is the flight that interests me. Not the flight page on the travel site, or the flight page on the airline site, but the URI (issued by the airlines) of the flight itself. That\u2019s what I will bookmark. And whichever device I use to look up the bookmark, phone or office wall, it will access a situation-appropriate view of an integration of everything I know about that flight from different sources. The task of booking and taking the flight will involve many interactions. And all throughout them, that task and the flight will be primary things in my awareness, the websites involved will be secondary things, and the network and the devices tertiary.\u00bb\r\rI have been following this path in the last ten years -- really. I actively played a role in the field of applied research to evaluate the impact of these technologies and to understand how, knowledge extraction, NLP and semantic technologies (now also called applied AI), could improve content management systems, publishing workflows, and content findability.\rAfter these intense two days at SEMANTiCS 2017, the 13th European Conference on Semantics Systems in Amsterdam, I can finally see this whole vision becoming a reality. Knowledge graphs are not just crucial for the improvement of various machine learning and cognitive computing tasks, they are at the core of leading edge organizations like Electronic Art. They serve as complex content models to compete in today\u2019s digital world.\rhttps://twitter.com/wordliftit/status/907588798699249665\rBefore incorporating WordLift as a startup we spent these last five years in harnessing the complexity of these technologies and I am proud now to hear esteemed managers at C-level, top notch consultants and even academics recognizing\u00a0WordLift as a first mover in the digital marketing automation to cleverly use the entire\u00a0stack of semantic technologies. \rWhile there is a broad universe of computing challenges that are now interesting for the semantic web community and again large enterprises and institutions are undertaking significant investment to move from legacy databases to linked data infrastructures -- imagine 100+ years of research documents being managed and produced by IET (The Institution of Engineering and Technology) becoming a giant graph, or scientific publishers of the size of Springer Nature, with their annual turnover of EUR 1.5 billion, moving to semantic graph databases --\u00a0Semantic SEO is still in its infancy in this industry, and real five stars linked data publishing for websites (without astronomical budgets) is really only possible with WordLift. \rThe recent uptake of our product also means that we can finally experiment with these technologies by iterating on all kinds of enhancements and by measuring their immediate impact on a wide range of different websites.\rhttps://twitter.com/wordliftit/status/907601998849159168\rIn the Freeyork.org\u00a0case that I presented at SEMANTiCS 2017, we had the unique opportunity to see how enriched articles performed against not enriched articles in terms of page views and sessions but also in terms of engagement metrics like average time spent on the page, session duration and number of pages visited per session. The results that we measured are impressive and not only important for the happy users of our service, but are paving the way for a completely new generation of AI-driven SEO tools powered by semantic technologies that combine knowledge extraction with high-quality graphs to help editors focus on their stories and let machines find the perfect audiences for it.\r\r\rThe key findings from the freeyork.org use case.\rIn this sense, @RamiaEl the editor in chief of\u00a0@Tharawatmag, has probably written, a few days ago, one of the best reviews for our plugin. \rhttps://twitter.com/wordliftit/status/907502790846631936\r\r&nbsp;\rIf I have to look ahead, the challenges that we need to face with WordLift and within the emerging market sector of automated SEO really are twofold: \r\r\r \tbuilding the business infrastructure around the technology to help us scale (Aaron Bradley and Eamonn Glass from Electronic Arts have been very clear to this regard - Simplify, Scale and Standardise)\r \timproving the quality of the data that we use to structure content and the quality of the data that we generate and publish. The leading edge, when you\u2019re creating intelligent content, as more people, will begin to use semantics, is going to be on the quality of the data. Machine learning here is a key player but,\u00a0still, I haven\u2019t seen many solutions where it has been effectively applied to data curation, cleaning, and interlinking.\r\rI will probably blog more about the conference in the next few days and I am sure that all the ideas and the\u00a0experiments that I have discussed, planned and evaluated in these two days\u00a0are going to help inform the way AI powered SEO will evolve in the next few years. \r\rNetworking with like-minded people, visionaries and researchers from all over the world (along with cycling in a stormy weather at full speed) is absolutely a great way to spend my time and to keep on improving our product. ?\r\r\r\u00a0\u00a0",

        "text": "How SalzburgerLand.com is engaging travelers and outperforming competitors SalzburgerLand Tourismus, while looking for an effective content marketing strategy to lure travelers, decided to build its own knowledge graph along with a new WordPress powered website. The Austrian regional tourism agency, after the first 6 months, has outperformed the competition: compared with&nbsp;161 websites from the same industry and with a similar range of traffic, Salzburgerland.com had acquired 92.65% more&nbsp;users via&nbsp;organic search. Wanna know how? Follow me and discover one of our best SEO case studies.&nbsp;Building the digital pathways to bring travelers in SalzburgerLandSalzburgerLand Tourismus (SLTG) is the agency responsible for marketing, development, and promotion of tourism in the region of Salzburg. Its main challenge is to attract and engage travelers from around the world, to meet their needs at the right time and to develop new travel products.\u00abThe strategic orientation of SLT is to transport main topics and highlights matching the needs and requirements of different markets and channels. On that point we are forcing the use of visual components (pictures, videos, cinemagraphs) to create emotions and to engage guests. At the same time we endeavor to deliver relevant information to every single traveler. Using WordLift (and WordLift Cloud) we are now able to structure our content, make it readable for machines to serve personal assistants like Alexa, Google Home or any other smart device - and to share it with our partners.\u00bbRainer Edlinger and Martin Reichhart, Digital Media Managers&nbsp;at SalzburgerLand TourismusNowadays travelers, in most cases, begin their exploration from Google. The search engine has become the place where people from different countries browse for ideas and dream about their future travel experiences. They use Google to look for the dates, flights, and hotels that match their expectations. Ultimately, with Google evolving into the biggest online travel agency worldwide, it has become strategic to reach customers at the right time during their journey by promoting top-notch content with both paid and organic positioning.We\u2019ve been collaborating with SLTG since 2014 to grow their organic traffic and to implement an open linked data content marketing strategy. Salzburgerland.com is SLTG's main online property and at the very center of a distributed network of online services (mobile websites, mobile apps, social media accounts and so on). The goal of the site has always been to attract world travelers from around the world with first-in-class engaging content.As a background activity to focus on the needs of SLTG, we have been studying travelers' behavior using regional open data on inquiries, bookings, and visits along with search intents. This analysis helped us define (and re-define) market segments, personas, and information needs for each target group.After analyzing the core business targets, the team drafted a set of traveler marketing personas and moved ahead with:Migrating to WordPressOrganizing existing and new content around different travelersCreating an enterprise knowledge graph - a semantic database that describes all concepts that matter: these are the key building blocks of the information architecture of the new website.#1 Migrating to WordPress: a strategic choiceSalzburgerland.com used to manage its content using an in-house developed Content Management System until they decided, back in 2016, to migrate to WordPress. There are several reasons for large organizations like SLTG to switch to an open source web CMS like WordPress:Continuous update of the technology with a controlled ICT budget. Automattic and the community around WordPress are responsible for updating the core of the CMS. Clients, like SLTG, need to run constant testing on all new releases of the software but all the development is open source and available to anyone for free.Increased flexibility in creating new content and a streamlined publishing workflow. This helps the editorial team focus on what really matters: great content that travelers want to read.The wide range of plugins available for WordPress, while overwhelming at the beginning, and sometimes extremely confusing, helps lower the cost of new developments on large websites.Improved performances when compared to other legacy systems, WordPress is fast (especially when combined with proper caching technologies and optimization tools).#2 Organizing existing and new content around different travelersTravelers from different countries have different information needs. Salzburgerland.com uses a multi-language website (and data) structure offering different content for each target group.Tourists are provided with appropriate navigation paths each one starting with a particular landing page. Each landing page is an entity that corresponds to a specific geographical location, an area of interest, an organization or a type of travel experience.#3 Creating an enterprise knowledge graphThe core of the new strategy for SLTG was not to revamp their website, but to create their own enterprise knowledge graph using linked data and semantic technologies. Organizations like SLTG integrate heterogeneous data from different sources and with a semantic database, all this data is made accessible to everyone.The enterprise knowledge graph helps infer new relationships out of existing facts, giving context and meaning to editorial content. SLTG has been experimenting over the years with semantic technologies, to gain a competitive advantage, to support their internal business decisions and to create new applications and touch points for the travelers.As the new portal was being designed the content has been semantically structured using WordLift to connect at best with their target audience (travelers from Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Italy and more) and to share their knowledge with their partners.Wondering about how to run a data-driven content marketing?Let's talk about it.Book a DemoWhat benefits come from building a knowledge graph?With WordLift, SLTG has been able to:Provide immediate access to travel information for both travelers and machines (including crawlers and chatbots) -- on large properties, it\u2019s simply impossible to manually add structured data.Drive more traffic, from Google -- this is true when compared to other travel websites and similar institutions in Austria and around Europe, thanks to an improved content architecture and to the semantic markup.Engage with travelers meeting them exactly when they are dreaming about inspiring places to visit and while they are scouting for new updates and information on SalzburgLand.com.Improve the UX providing a new enriched content model to help travelers discover Salzburg Land and its breathtaking sites.Release an Open Linked Data infrastructure to make all the information published on the site available to third parties (Hotels, Travel Agencies, Booking Systems, and more) as open data.On Salzburgerland.com WordLift entities are used as landing pages for different market segments: almost 2.500 entities in eight languages make up the starting vocabulary and perform as search magnets for organic traffic.Salzburgerland.com Entities per languageTo keep the good work up, editors are regularly creating new content around entities and adding new entities (based on the information that the semantic databases reveal to the marketing team).The new Salzburgerland.com has been online since the end of January 2017. We have been able to look at the metrics and to benchmark the results against other travel websites (and yes, competition, especially in Austria in the sector of tourism, is extremely fierce ? ).Between February 2017 and July 2017, the site has acquired via organic search 148.166 new users. When compared to other 161 online properties (using Google Analytics benchmarking tool) in Austria (with similar traffic) this is 92.65% more than anyone else. Salzburgerland.com, so far, has been really outperforming its competitors. ?Here is how linked data helps Google Assistant respond to an English speaking traveler about a series of event called \u201cBauernherbst\u201d (the German word for Harvest Festival)[wl_navigator]What\u2019s next?Salzburgerland.com\u2019s enterprise knowledge graph is now available on open.salzbugerland.com. This dataset describes points of interest, main sites, events and any attraction for travelers in the region. Application developers and partners can now directly use data from the enterprise knowledge graph.Using the data portal is possible to interact directly via the endpoint in SPARQL. Try it yourself, and look for the list of&nbsp;events grouped by town.We\u2019re now working on integrating other data sources into the graph to boost the SEO of all the websites in the SLTG network. Moreover, the team is working on reusing the data to create a new voice activated digital experience using Alexa and the Google Assistant.Working with SLTG for us over these years has been a terrific experience and a lot of the enhancements in today\u2019s product are the results of the fruitful collaboration between our startup and their digital marketing team. Besides being truly in love with this charming region of Austria we\u2019re extremely grateful for all the support, brilliant insights and opportunities that SLTG has shared with us. ?",

        "text": "How an expert professional SEO evolves in the age of AI How the semantic web (r)evolution is affecting the daily work of SEO experts?\r\rIn this article, you are going to meet the English SEO Exert\u00a0Mark Bryce-Sharron and learn from his story why semantics is a game-changing science when applied to the optimization of websites and pages.\r\rWhile Google is sharpening its semantic weapons with Hummingbird and RankBrain; the line between SEO, data analysis, and content organization is blurring. The Semantic web and schema.org markup are not new concepts for your average digital marketer, nowadays, however, having an understanding of both the theory and application is giving a selected few SEO agencies a competitive edge.\rMeet Mark Bryce-Sharron\rFounder and Director of the British digital agency Sussex SEO, Mark loves to keep his hands-on and his head learning. He manages clients\u2019 search and social strategies, and he says about himself:\r\r\u00abSEO and social media fuel my passion for self-study as they present an endless exponential learning curve that few careers can match. I devote an average of one/two hours per day, monitoring industry data, IM forums and following case studies thus ensuring that I keep my skill set up to date so changes to such as Google\u2019s Penguin update don\u2019t cost my clients lost business.\u00bb\r\rHe founded his agency in 2006 with a very smart approach: instead of focusing on a range of keywords his clients should rank for, he works on developing a holistic digital strategy for each client to multiply the sources of traffic and maximize the brand exposure.\r\rIt\u2019s a long path, instead of a bunch of tricks and easy patches, but - in the long run - it works, and it\u2019s less sensitive to the latest algos from Mountain View.\r\rWe were curious to know the journey that brought Mark and his agency to a semantic approach and how it impacted the SEO operations for his clients.\r3 signs and a plot twist\rBack in 2014, Mark was already quite familiar with semantic strategies. Though, the enlightening comprehension of the great change that was coming forward was yet to come.\r\r\u00abWe were kind of flying the big line at that point, and feeding the search engine what it wanted.\u00bb He says.\r\rAnd how did you realize that something had changed forever in the SEO industry?\r\r\u00abAt the beginning of this year (2017) something happened, I noticed a significant change in search results. No longer were web pages being displayed in order of relevance, rather the search engine was offering alternatives. The pattern was pretty easy to spot. Short tail keywords were returning results that offered the user a selection of choices e.g. cost, jobs, general information, legal information, and services. I had known this was coming but it honestly caught me by surprise.\r\r\u00abThere had been rumblings that Hummingbird was the most significant update to Google\u2019s core ranking algorithm back in 2014, three years later the penny really dropped for me. What suddenly became obvious was the search engine was now not simply attempting to present the user with results in order of relevance, it was attempting to calculate the user's intent and provide answers. Where the search command did not supply enough information e.g. short tail keywords, the search engine would supply a montage of different types of results. As you narrow down your search criteria with more specific long tail or conversational queries the answer provided became more specific.\r\r\u00abLike many SEOs I\u2019m self-taught and the way I learn is by testing and talking to other industry professionals (usually in the pub over a pint or several). Networking is key, if you don't exchange Ideas with others your methodology stagnates. One particular drinking buddy (tentacle.ai) works with big data and artificial intelligence, armed with his laptop and a pint of craft beer he showed me an AI chatbot he was working on. As he explained its inner workings I was surprised to find we were using that same terminology e.g. parsers/classifier algorithms.\r\r\r\r\u00abSomething clicked, Google was using AI. Rankbrain wasn\u2019t just vapourware it was actively being used to serve improved search engine results.\r\r\u00abAnother contact,\u00a0Robert Adler (BOFU2U), had previously introduced to me to the concept of creating entities within a site and semantic linking using anchor text and the schema.org sameAs attribute.\r\r\u00abAt this point, I had an idea of the components required for a case study but needed a mechanism to deploy the code.\r\u00abMy SEO plugin of choice is SEO Ultimate, it blows Yoast out of the water and contains a set of modules that allow users to inject code into pages. I was after something that could inject the same bit of code info multiple page headers. I reached out to Jeffrey Smith, the founder of SEO Ultimate. He told me that he was partnering with WordLift to offer advanced semantic SEO to his clients and he lead me to your plugin. I took a look at what you guys were doing and yes, it blew my mind: so I took you for a test drive, WordLift provided everything I needed and everything I wanted. I\u2019ve tried WordLift, after spending significant time on content to be sure the copy was good and it wasn\u2019t duplicated, and - sure enough! - things started to move very positively.\u00bb\rSo, how are you using WordLift for your clients?\r\r\u00abThere are a number of approaches.\r\r \tInstall and go.\r \tInstall, go and add unique content to vocabulary pages.\r \tPlan a vocabulary by trawling the semantic web, seed existing website copy with your vocabulary (LSI keywords), Order content, install the plugin and replace the vocabulary with original content/create new entities within the plugin.\r\r\u00abA strong starting point is a vocabulary of 120 pages. My vocabulary pages start at 1000 words in length and include question, answers, statistics and I keep building them out.\u00bb\r\r\u00abOf course, I don\u2019t just go through and take every single entity the NLP AI extracts, I pick things making some decisions based on common sense: is this entity relevant for my website? And that\u2019s how I build my vocabulary.\r\r\u00abNow, if I just put WordLift on my side, and don\u2019t add any extra copy to those vocabulary pages it still begins to move, but when we start to add links to the pages - that\u2019s when it really started to get interesting.\u00bb\r\r\rA smooth, gentle traffic uplift\rUntil today, Mark has used WordLift on 10 different websites of his clients. Quite a vantage point from where to see if the results that WordLift brings to traffic metrics are real, measurable, and repeatable.\r\r\u00abWhat I noticed is that when you deploy the plugin you get a steady very desirable growth. Depending on how you use the plugin it will depend the results you get: you do have to cope with strategic content research and content creation, to get the most out of it, and also you have to be aware that somehow Google changes, like RankBrain.\r\r\u00abSome people say RankBrain is just a machine learning algorithm, but I see that it is virtualizing some pieces of language of certain types of language: often phrases, or questions, or propositions, or answers... So the key thing you offer is semi-automatically generating schema.org markup, which has a very very smooth potential to website\u2019s use and Google knows it, because Google is gently starting to push the next generation. With the coding, there is just the ability to remove any ambiguity from a piece of text and to help Google work less hard to calculate some meaning behind the text on the page. - I don\u2019t use the word understands, because I don\u2019t believe AI understands at this particular point in time\u2026 but it certainly does a very good job in processing the meaning.\r\r\u00abWith WordLift what you see is a slow, gentle, constant climate. So it doesn\u2019t happen overnight, it happens in the space of three months. It is like a gentle trigger.\u00bb\rWrap-up &amp; lessons learned\rWhen the semantic web meets AI the impact on the web is huge. Think about the effect of RankBrain on a single search, and multiply it for all the existing industries where SEO is relevant for business.\r\rSEO Specialist can\u2019t ignore those transformations - they have to stay on top of them\u00a0and to find new techniques and reliable tools that really work.\r\rIf there is something that Mark\u2019s story teaches us, is that in an ever-changing context, such as the web is, digital pros need to upgrade continually and to sharpen their weapons while the search engines are doing the same on a larger scale.",

        "text": "Who's using voice assistants and why? Infographic and resources for marketers Once there was a keyboard, then a touchscreen. Today there is a voice. A magnetic, robotic voice is becoming the helpful right-hand of Millennials, the caring assistant of busy Gen Xers and the quick memo reminder for Baby Boomers.\r\rAccording to TechCrunch, 41.7 million people are using Siri, 23.2 million people are using S Voice, 19.8 million people are using Google Text-to-Speech, and while Microsoft Cortana is used by around 700k people, home assistants have stepped triumphally into the market reaching an interesting share -- Google Home is already used by 4.7 million people and Amazon Alexa by 2.6 million.\rHow are people using voice assistants?\rNumbers are speaking loud and clear. Since\u00a0voice search is no more a buzzword, but a growing trend, marketers should better know:\r\r \twhat are all these people searching and doing with virtual assistants?\r \thow often and for which purposes do they use\u00a0them?\r \twhich technologies and devices do they prefer?\r\rThere is still a bigger question marketers should be wondering about. The Question. I will get back on this at the end of the article. Now, follow me. ?\r\rIn this infographic, Quill.com\u00a0collected several data about how people use\u00a0voice assistants. In a glance, you will see which commands are the most used, how different generations are performing different tasks through these technologies, how to use virtual assistants to be more productive, and which are the strengths, weaknesses, and differences between the most widespread solutions.\r\rNot surprisingly, online\u00a0search is the second kind of command performed by users. Have a look below.\rSpeak Up: Have a more productive day with the help of voice assistants\rInfographic by Quill\rContent marketing in the age of voice assistants\rIf content marketing is still a thing, it's time to start thinking about screen-less interactions and to start redesigning content for users who don't actually read content -- but listen to it. And it makes a lot of difference.\r\rListening and reading are pretty much similar cognitive processes. But they are not the same thing. Most of the times conditions and degrees of attention are different.\r\rMoreover, you have to optimize your content and think its format in order to be picked by machines as a result\u00a0of a voice search -- and you have to think about this technical filter.\u00a0It's not like you are going to talk your readers yourself. Nope. A robotic voice will pick your pages and read them, only if the algorithms behind the voice\u00a0assistant value your content suitable enough for their user.\r\rSo, the big question is: how to write good content for voice search?\r\rHere at\u00a0WordLift, we have studied, written and experimented a lot about this subject.

        "text": "From Nada to Armada: 3 reasons why structured data and schema markup can make your website rock! Schema markup is significant for anyone that wants to contribute to today\u2019s web.\r\rMany think of structured data as the future. Yet it is the present. Many big players understood the importance of structured data a few years ago already. Now small players have the chance to take advantage of those technologies to win the SEO game.\r\rWhen you go to schema.org you\u2019ll see the initiative was launched and founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, and Yandex. It is not a case those big players contributed to the foundation of the Semantic Web. It was the most logical step in the evolution of search engines.\r\rFacebook, Google, and Amazon spent the last years building their knowledge graphs. You might think that is irrelevant for a small player. Yet it\u2019s not. In a world where big players control the web, it is crucial to guarantee that each of us can contribute to the development of the internet. Structured data and Knowledge graphs are the tools that allow anyone to build today's web. \r\rNow those technologies are available to anyone with tools like WordLift.\r\rWhy is Schema markup crucial? Three reasons! \r\r1. Findability can make or break a business\rStructured data on the web is what schema.org is all about. The goal of the activity is to encourage the publishing of data on the web that is understandable for search engines.\rTeodora Petkova, philologist and professional semantic writer on SEO, Linked Data and Your Fridge Browsing the Web\r\rIt doesn\u2019t matter how well-written is your content. If machines can\u2019t read it, humans can\u2019t find it. If people can\u2019t find it, your content will get buried in the organic search. Thus, no one will know you ever wrote it. \r\r\r\rUsing Schema markup is like translating that content for search engines. Eventually, they\u2019ll be able to find it more easily. Also, through Schema markup search engines will be able to read better and interpret the user\u2019s question to locate the content he/she is looking for. That is how your content goes from nada to armada in a few clicks. \r\r\r\rIn this way, rather than having your piece of content buried in the organic search, you\u2019ll make it easier to find and more prone to be suggested to a user. \r2. Who finds the right related article finds a treasure \rSlow content doesn\u2019t ride news waves, but it can ride the longer, smoother industry waves to create stellar, valuable content that is quoted and cited for years to come.\rCameron Conaway, Content Marketing Manager at Klipfolio, on Slow Content\r\rOne huge issue that any website or online magazine faces is the lack of essential interconnectedness between one piece of content with the other. Often you land on a cool website. Read an interesting article, just to find at the end of it a \u201crelated article\u201d widget. That widget too often points toward a plethora of junk items (from how to get tanned, to which razor to use when shaving!). For dismal ad earnings, many websites and magazines are losing their opportunity to build quality traffic that will make them successful in the long-run.\r\r\r\rWith Schema markup you can connect each piece of content to the next semantically, meaningfully and consciously. Therefore making it easier to navigate to the user.\r\r\r3. Let me hang out with your website \rIf you want your prospects and customers to think of your brand as exceptional, you have to deliver exceptional experiences with content. Every time. At every touch point. Period.\rScott Abel, The Content Wrangler Talking Content Marketing\r\r\r\rWe often think of a website as a static place. The user clicks in, scrolls a bit, then clicks out. Our perspective is quickly changing. With the rise of voice search, websites become interactive. More and more people will want to hang out with a website. Rather than just click, tap and scroll; users want to ask, argue and talk. In this scenario Schema markup, and Knowledge Graphs are the tools that allow machines to read, and manipulate enough connected information to extrapolate knowledge that can answer the reader's questions. \r\rFor instance, when I meet new people. They often ask me \u201cwhat\u2019s your job?\u201d and I say \u201cI\u2019m BizDev at WordLift.\u201d Next thing they ask is \u201cwhat is WordLift?\u201d \r\rWhat if your website could interact at the same way with a user? It turns out it can, and our website already does! \r\rhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWDBlkNncU4\rWrapping up and Conclusions \rStructured data is what can bring your business to the next level. In fact, through that you can achieve several goals: \r\r \tMake your content machine-friendly. Therefore, easier to find for your tribe\r \tLet users navigate within the website by finding meaningful content. Thus, allowing them to create a long-term relationship with your website\r \tHave your website ready to talk. In this way, it won\u2019t be a static page but a place your tribe would love to hang out\r\rIn conclusion, people in the future won\u2019t ask how many clicks your website is getting but rather if that is a place people would love to hang out. Is your website that place? \rIf you want to know more about these topics...\r\rJoin our webinar on machine-friendly content with Scott Abel ?\r\rSeptember 14th at 5:00 pm Central European Time (8:00 am PT / 11:00 am ET)\r",

        "text": "Richer, faster, easier: WordLift 3.13 will make your long-form articles shine Long-form articles overcome the pervasive lack of attention building a stronger relationship between the writer and the reader. In the last months, our developers worked on WordLift 3.13 with a simple, yet powerful idea: bringing a richer, faster, and easier text analysis, that works wonderfully with long articles.\rWhy long articles matter?\rAs a reader in the communication overload era, the most precious thing you need is a compass that guides you across a World Wide Web which is overflowing with content. As a content writer, you need to become that compass, and most of your efforts go in the direction of building your own trustability. Long-form articles can be helpful resources to deeply understand a matter, and here is why readers love them, in spite of the time they take to be read.\r\rThe bond of trust plays a relevant role here: you spend time reading a long-form article because you trust its author or its publisher, and therefore you think that article can be interesting. Meanwhile, the more you read, the more it - with the deep insights and its argumentative structure - binds you to the author. If the text is up to expectations of the reader, author's advice and point of view become that compass everybody is looking for out there on the Web.\r\rSometimes, like short essays, long articles include references to several concepts, facts, and information coming from different contexts... but what if the reader needs to get deeper into some of these concepts? Typically, he/she will search on Google and end up on reading an article in Wikipedia. So much time spent writing a contextualized and informed article, just to send your readers to Wikipedia? Ouch!\r\r\r\rThere is a better way. \r\rWhen you annotate your articles with WordLift, you provide your readers with additional information chunks, so that they can fully understand your article on your own website without leaving it.\rWhat's new in the text analysis of WordLift 3.13?\rRicher\rUntil WordLift 3.12, when you wrote a long-form article, the number of entities that our plugin was able to recognize via natural language processing was limited, due to the fact that we originally considered a blog post to have an average of 500-600 words. Many entities you would have expected were missing. Now, WordLift segments your texts into shorter paragraphs and can detect most of the entities that you need.\r\rWe have tested this feature internally by analyzing five long articles from our blog. We measured the recall of WordLift version 3.13 and compared it with the previous release. Out of these very basic tests, the recall improved on average by 53%; the number of correct results was more than doubled when compared to the previous release!\r\rSee the results of our test in the chart below:\r\r\rFaster\rWe also measured WordLift's speed when analyzing articles, and there is another great news for our users: text analysis is +31% faster on average. We are really happy to help you save your time for something more creative!\r\rWanna see the numbers? Have a look at the figure below:\r\r\rEasier\rWe recognized that giving you a richer list of results without any filter would create a confusing experience.\r\rFrom now on, you'll see a shortlist of 20 entities listed under the tab 'all'. These entities are automatically selected between those who have been mentioned more often on the article. All the other entities are categorized and listed in alphabetical order by clicking on the tabs 'who', 'what', 'where', and 'when'.\r\r\rAn early tester\rOne of our early testers, Oscar Valentini, owner of Tao Roma (if you are following our blog, you've probably met him before, if not, read his use case) tried two days ago and said:\r\rWordLift's text analysis has finally an amazing speed! I couldn't be happier!\r\rSo, it's time to update WordLift! Enjoy our latest release and let us know your feedbacks.",

        "text": "SEO lessons for authors: following Aesop time travels to our present days When I started to write on the web I realized I was supposed to change my writing style if I wanted search engines to understand what I wrote. Yet semantic technologies allow our stories to be understood\u00a0by\u00a0search engines even though their authors manage to write them for humans only. How is that possible? Read on...\u00a0\rOnce upon a time a crow was sitting on a branch of a tree with a piece of cheese in her beak when a Fox observed her and set his wits to work to discover some way of getting the cheese. Coming and standing under the tree he looked up and said,\r\r\"What a noble bird I see above me! Her beauty is without equal, the hue of her plumage exquisite. If only her voice is as sweet as her looks are fair, she ought without doubt to be Queen of the birds.\"\r\rThe Crow was hugely flattered by this, and just to show the Fox that she could sing she gave a loud caw. Down came the cheese, of course, and the Fox, snatching it up, said\r\r\"You have a voice, madam, I see: what you want is wits.\"\rThis is\u00a0The Fox and the Crow, one of the most popular Aesop's fables.\r\rWritten around the sixth century B.C. presumably by Aesop. Even though we don't know for sure if Aesop ever existed. Those fables are a powerful narrative device. If you ever heard any of those stories, chances are you never forgot. Why?\rHuman Memory in a Nutshell\rHuman memory is slightly different from a computer's memory. In short, we know there are certain parts of the human brain that play a key role in forming memories. Yet those regions work in unison with other parts of our brains to make those memories formed.\u00a0\r\rLike a symphony. Our memories get shaped by the interactions between billions of neurons, in a wild dance in which those nerve cells make synaptic connections. Those connections also become memories. The more neurons fire together, the more those thoughts become sticky. Psychologists like to summarize this process in neurons that fire together wire together.\r\rIf we looked at your brain with an MRI scanner - think of the MRI as a camera that takes pictures of your brain in action - while listening to a story, you would see several regions of your brain lighting up.\r\rAlthough ancient people didn't have MRI scanners, they understood what happened behind the scenes of the human brain. They already grasped the importance of metaphors as devices to create memories. Those memories could last for decades and get spread for millennia to come. Jumping from brain to brain they got tied together by metaphors. Yet it seems we have forgotten this lesson in the last two decades, when search engines took over the web. Ever since, keywords ruled over content.\rAesop the Blogger\rImagine Aesop was a literary author in today's world. He has this great book in his hands, yet no big publishing house willing to sponsor\u00a0it. What to do?\r\rAesop could self-publish that literary work. Yet he wants to test and see if there is an audience for it. Thus, Aesop creates a WordPress blog. That is the most logical choice, as he doesn't have any coding skills - coming from Ancient Greece. Opening for the first time his internet browser he finds himself in a weird place. That place's name is Google. From gurus to marketers Aesop is looking for inspiration. He dives in an article that tells him how to start a blog in ten steps, three somersaults, and a loop-de-loop. He seems very confused.\r\rFinally, Aesop finds an article from a bold and bald man. That article has a magic formula inside. That is the formula to becoming the most known author in the Googlesphere. Taken aback by his ignorance Aesop finally learns about keywords!\r\rThus, in front of a ten-page how-to article on how to make his fables more \"machine-friendly\", Aesop's work goes to ashes.\r\rWhat had happened? To make his content ranked, Aesop decided to convert all the metaphors and fables in keywords!\r\rThank god this is only a thought experiment and Aesop never made it through our times. Otherwise, we would have lost one of the most important literary works ever created. Yet if keywords were the rule of thumb in the last decades, can we expect to see a paradigm shift anytime soon?\rWhen Keywords Become Metaphors\rIn the last two decades search engines took over the web and they created a net for their own sake. This net revolved around the use of keywords. How could not be so? To make us find what we were looking for we had to adjust our thinking to fit that little quest box.\r\rThat is how we went from thinking out of the box to thinking within that narrow search box. That is also how we moved away from the why and more toward the how of things. The era of tutorials, how-to articles, and how to become a magician in ten steps arose. Is that era is close to an end? In part, it might be.\r\rSince 2013, when RankBrain got launched, search engines are picking up. In fact, through NLP\u00a0(natural language processing) machines now understand human language. Thus, we are finally going back to think out of that little search box into our human consciousness.\r\rFor instance, through our digital assistants, we ask more and more questions. In short, rather than using keywords, we now ask questions and we want an answer. The revolution though is that we now want answers not only from Google. But also from the websites that populate the web. Would you ever talk to a website that speaks in keywords? Of course not! Yet while it made sense a few years ago, it doesn't anymore.\r\rSearch engines are becoming better and better at \"interpreting\" human language. They can extrapolate the information needed to answer our questions. Thus, make those blogs and websites speak to us.\r\rRather than make our text fit machines' requirements (as it happened so far), finally authors, bloggers, and content creators can focus on writing stories. Metaphors and anecdotes, in this era, should be the rule. Rather than focusing all our efforts on keywords, we can finally go back to write for people.\rGoogle meets Aesop\rWhile writing an article you can now focus on inspiring others while software like WordLift does the rest for you. For instance, within this article, I created a set of\u00a0entities within my vocabulary, which explained to\u00a0search engines what my article is about. In fact, by adding a schema markup to my article, I put\u00a0search engines in condition to understand the content. Thus, without placing any keyword within the text I connected the fable to other concepts such as Google and Technology. You can see it from the schema markup I created through WordLift:\r\rLinked metadata describing this article\rIn the meanwhile, WordLift is also putting things into context by creating a knowledge graph.\r\r\rThe Metadata visualized using LOD View\rIn other words, in a few seconds and without placing a line of code I achieved those results:\r\r\r \tPassed\u00a0toward search engines the definition of the concepts within the articles trough schema\r \tContextualized the content of the article through the knowledge graph\r\rIn other words, search engines are enabled to realize that The Fox and The Crow is a fable, but it was told in the context of SEO. Thus, by making this article\u00a0unique.\rWhat's next?\rIn the last two decades, a new style of writing was born. A style based on 200-pages long how-to-articles. Most of us caught into this game. We also thought we determined it. The truth is we never chose it. It was imposed on us. In fact, that style was (in part) born from the necessity\u00a0to make search engines understand our content. Either we did that or we were out of the web. The price to pay was too high. Therefore, we started to write dry content, mainly based on keywords to make sure it was ranked. In the meanwhile, we lost track of ancient wisdom.\r\rOver two thousand years ago people already knew the importance of fictional stories. In the last decade, neuroscience confirmed that our brain likes those stories. In short, the human mind does not want the truth to be given\u00a0on a silver\u00a0plate.\u00a0Our mind wants to dig, interpret, wonder and visualize before getting to the truth.\r\rNow semantic technologies allow us to tell stories, fables, and anecdotes again. The web doesn't have to be a\u00a0dry land but it can finally become a place of wonder.\r\r",

        "text": "5 Reasons to attend the next WordCamp - A lesson learned at WCEU 2017 What is a WordCamp? How do people in the WordPress community look like? What's the magic behind the people that power&nbsp;28 percent of the Web?&nbsp;What is so exciting about meeting contributors from around the world and end up translating strings of a content management software that a lot of tech people consider messy and somehow outdated?I've attended my first European WordCamp along with other&nbsp;1.900 people traveling from 79 countries to answer these questions and to present WordLift to partners and friends. Long time WordPress ninjas agree that the&nbsp;WordCamp Europe 2017 edition was by far one of the best&nbsp;(article by WP&nbsp;Tavern).Attending a WordCamp is not just about reviewing themes and discussing core developments of the WordPress platform but it is really about looking closely at the enthusiasm of a thriving and highly competitive eco-system. &nbsp;Here is my short summary of the event and my five reasons to attend the next WordCamp: \tAccessibility and inclusivity matter. Enjoy it!&nbsp;If there is a single theme to describe WordPress's core efforts nowadays this would be&nbsp;inclusivity. From presentation about the ongoing efforts&nbsp;to grow the platform, to marketing trends inside Automattic, everything is designed to be accessible to everyone, regardless of technical skills and language barriers.&nbsp; \tInnovation as a side effect. Let's catch up!&nbsp;WordPress easy-of-use remains the most important driver of adoption of&nbsp;WordPress. Never the less the community is there to show you that a lot of innovative and amazing work is still happening under the hood. We develop WordLift, our semantic SEO plugin, with a focus on digital marketing automation, so my attention was somehow biased by the presentation of Gutenberg (WordPress new web editor technology). Matt Mullenweg attended a casual Q&amp;A session and showed us a demo of the editor that finally introduces true workflow capabilities on WordPress and can be already tested by downloading a&nbsp;plugin on WordPress.org. Now, while a good chunk of the presentations revolve around the industry, open source initiatives and testimonials, there is a great lot of innovation to catch up with (and this is, of course, a great sign) &nbsp; &nbsp; \tCompetition is fierce and many-sided. It's time to find your next partner.&nbsp;By attending this type of events you can finally understand and see that behind the enthusiastic open source community spirit there is a billion dollars economy that fights like crazy to remain ahead of the curve and to create consistent business value. If you're making a living using WordPress, if you have spent nights coding themes or plugins, a WordCamp really is an event to attend. It's not just a venue where platform's&nbsp;users and blogging newbies&nbsp;gather every now and then, this is the event that represents an entire industry! \tGreat products are made by people, so go and meet them. Products are never finished. This is true for digital products and now it is also true for things that exist in the real world like cars and airplanes. Kevin Kelly talks about 'becoming' as one of his twelve technological forces that shape our future. The basic idea is that perfection does no longer exist and you as a maker shall keep on adapting your product to change what you're building and to respond to the audience. This also means that people, still play a pivotal role in these ecosystems. Their product adapts over time but their vision is what you, as a prosumer (or consumer) are really buying. A WordCamp is a terrific place where you can go and showcase like we did, your&nbsp;plugin to WordPress's living rockstars like Joost de Valk from Yoast or Syed Balkhi from WPBeginners and Optin Monster. \tGive back, always.&nbsp;It's good for your karma and good for your business. Whether you are cheering up a thought leader speaking on the front stage or you decide to roll up your sleeves and join for the Contributor Day a WordCamp is the place where you have your chance to move your energy and intentions in favor of others. I don't want to sound too mystical but this really is the life blood of these experiences.Here is a timeline from our Twitter account and below, two real gems I picked for you!https://twitter.com/i/moments/875679146705399810Now two contributions that really deserve your attention:1. John Maeda head of Design and Inclusion at Automattic&nbsp;presenting the three types of design: classical design, business design, and computational design&nbsp;(as during his talk for the WordCamp John explains in this video that&nbsp;inclusivity is the secret weapon of every successful design team).&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU3y-5Peh9A2.&nbsp;Marina Pape - Marketing Wrangler at WooCommerce sharing her precious experience.

        "text": "Why use WordPress for your website? WordPress is the most popular open source Web Content Management System used by 27% of the entire Internet. It is free, extremely easy to use and provides thousands of plugins and themes to create a compelling user experience with a limited investment.\rYou've been warming up to the idea of a website for your business for a long time, but there has always been something stopping you. Finally, you've decided to create your own website. You know what it will be about and you also have some content idea to start with, and yet you have\u00a0a huge question mark hanging over your head: what CMS should I use?\r\rIf you are here, somebody probably suggested you that WordPress is a great platform to start with. But... is it going to fit your needs? Is WordPress the right choice for you? The short answer is: probably it is. Although WordPress is born as a blogging platform, nowadays it is one of the most extended and comprehensive CMS\u00a0platforms and it is a good choice for any kind of website. And you know what the good news is? It is still a very easy starting point for beginners.\r\rWe asked to Luca Sartoni, an Italian blogger who is now working at\u00a0Automattic as a Growth\u00a0Engineer, a few good reasons to choose WordPress for your first website. Here are his hints:\r\rhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7lsnqwZnOI\r\u00a0So, in a nutshell, with WordPress you can maximize your output and minimize your risks, thanks to a strong and active community which contributes to the CMS in many different ways.\rExcellent! Also, I have my own list of good reasons for you - and I'm pretty sure you'll love them.\r1. It's free to install, maintain and upgrade\rThe cost voice is always such a pain, and any way to spare some money feels like a great relief. So, yes, you can spare on your website budget just choosing WordPress. If you choose WordPress, designing, developing and - especially - maintaining your website is going to cost you way less! How? Well, basically thanks to all the reasons below. ?\r2. It's open source - and here is why you should care about this!\rLet's start from the beginning: what does open source mean? Literally, open source means that the source code is free to use, to study and to change. This is not just something developers should care. In fact in the case WordPress, there are a lot of benefits here for you:\r\r \tThe CMS comes for free. Forever. Anyone is free to install it, use it, and adapt it to his/her needs, for any kind of website with or without commercial purposes. And it doesn't cost a penny.\r \tIt keeps growing thanks to a large community of contributors who constantly work to build a better software (see the fourth point\u00a0to know more about this).\r \tNo vendor lock-in: if this is your first website, you'll need a web agency or a freelance to design and develop it. In a few years, you may choose to change your vendor and rely on another one for several reasons. Well, thanks to open source, you won't have to start from the beginning to project your website: any other freelance or agency which works with WordPress can take it over and update, upgrade or change your website according to your needs.\r\rIn short: with WordPress you are choosing a free CMS which is always up-to-date and has no vendor lock-in.\r3. It's extremely easy to learn, I swear!\rOnce the website is up and running, it's incredibly easy to create and publish new content. You just open your WordPress back-end, create a new page or article and add any picture, video, or other media. Then\u00a0you\u00a0click publish and your new content is online. Not happy with your output? You can still go back and change it. That's it, really. Anyone that can use a word processor can use it. No technical skills required. Just try and then tell me.\rIn other words,\u00a0WordPress' learning curve is so easy and comfortable, that\u00a0you will be able to add content by yourself, without asking it to some dark technical figure (coff coff - just joking, uh?) to add new pages or to update the old ones.\r4. It has thousands of themes and plugins to add new features in a snap\rSince WordPress was born as a CMS for blogs, many people are worried about\u00a0the customizations: is WordPress the right choice for an e-commerce? Will I be able to add a stunning design to my web pages? Can I\u00a0do this and that? Yes, you probably can. While the core source of WordPress gives you already most of the things you need for a good basic website (or blog) which is responsible and SEO-friendly, you can explore a whole bunch of new opportunities by adding:\r\r \tPlugins: to have more features and expand your website turning it into an e-commerce, an online community or whatever you have in mind.\r \tThemes: you can choose from thousands of different designs and apply them to your website. To make the most out of them you can also heavily customize most of the themes, building a website fully consistent with your brand.\r\rOnce you discover the large family of WordPress plugins and themes, you'll understand that you can do whatever you need just installing existing and tested resources. And the best thing is: many of them come for free. Just a few examples of websites using WordPress: Microsoft News Center, AMC (yep, those of Breaking Bad and Walking Dead), The Herald Sun, The Walt Disney Company, Quartz, Facebook Newsroom... I'm sure you'll notice two things:\r\r \tThere are a lot of big enterprises which are trusting WordPress\r \tYou can build a wide range of different websites.\r\rSo... apparently, there's no\u00a0reason to think that WordPress would not fit your needs. Is it?\rIn a few words: since there are lots of ready-to-use resources, you can spare on web design and development, because customizing a website with WordPress is way faster, easier and cheaper than starting from a blank page.\r5. It's powered by a massive, supportive, awesome community\rThis is one of the coolest benefits of using WordPress. Anytime you need some help, advice or support, you're just a question away from your solution. You can ask your question on any forum or social media group to the community members and receive valuable and actionable\u00a0information. And it happens quickly! You may ask: why? Well, WordPress is adopted by the 27% of Internet websites and many web designers, developers, and content creators feel so much committed to it that they want to share value with the community and to see it grow.\r\rThe graphic above shows how popular WordPress is in the World. Source: W3Techs - April 2017 And you?\r\rWell, anytime you have a cool idea, you can start working on it and share it, for the benefit of all the community. There's wide space for the contribution and the cooperation of anyone with anyone around the world.\rLet me put it this way: you can ask the help of the community to overcome any obstacle - so, less money spent in consultancy if you just have the patience to ask and learn.\rIn a few words: why do you have to start from the beginning if you can just\u00a0jump on giants' shoulders? ?",

        "text": "5 Handy Tips on Google Assistant to Future Proof your SEO Strategy Are you are trying to add voice search as part of your SEO strategy?&nbsp;This&nbsp;article walks through 5&nbsp;simple tactics to engage your audience with the help of Google Assistant.I love it when new acronyms and buzzwords enter the scene in digital marketing. Most of the time these new words&nbsp;arrive bold and fast and we all get the feeling that it is impossible to keep up.&nbsp;Some expressions are simply fun, others are&nbsp;mind-numbing&nbsp;or even hard to understand. What's behind a new buzzword? What does it really mean?  What we have to keep in mind is that a new term is coined when there is enough understanding around a specific topic&nbsp;but at the same time - no one has yet given it a name. It is much like red links in Wikipedia: there is the need for an article explaining that specific topic but no one has yet created one.A week ago, the columnist of Search Engine Land,&nbsp;John Lincoln introduced PASO:&nbsp;Personal Assistant Search Optimization and yes, we are going to&nbsp;create a brand new named entity in our vocabulary: it totally deserves it! As someone might say, \"PASO is the new SEO\" or at least, part of the emerging set of techniques that forward-thinking marketers and SEO experts shall master to compete in the era of chatbots, voice search and AI in general.[caption id=\"attachment_4042\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"267\"] Microsoft Agent[/caption]I have been a big fan of these technologies for a long time. In fact, it was back in 1998 when David and me, alongside with other geeky friends, began playing with personal digital assistants&nbsp;online in our first web agency.&nbsp;Microsoft Agent was our first programmable online buddy: a technology introduced in Windows 98 (I know this may sound prehistoric) that made use of animated characters, text-to-speech engines, and speech recognition to help people interact with computers. The fun part of it was that you could program it using HTML and VBScript and with few lines of code, you could see \"Genie\" popping up in your browser's window. Now let's be actionable and begin to share our secrets. \"Where does the information come from?\" This is the question you should always start with. When creating a chatbot or when starting&nbsp;a conversation in the real world we always begin from some kind of prior&nbsp;knowledge: an article we have read, a TV series, a book or a web page. Computers are not much different from us. They take their answers from clusters of information typically organized in large graphs. As we discover their sources of information we can inject our viewpoints and get them to know us better.Tip #1: Control Rank ZeroWhen dealing with Google Home or Google Allo or&nbsp;Google Assistant (they do have their own slight differences) one source of information are the so-called rank zero snippets. These are featured snippets in search results&nbsp;whose summary has been extracted programmatically from a web page. While the real difference, for these snippets, is not the way the information has been fetched by Google (as this works much like the good old SEO) but how the result is presented to the user: these snippets answer a great lot of questions, triggered by our voice. Sometimes controlling Rank Zero can be as simple as interacting with a site owner, share your product and get a review for it. Here are the steps I followed:look&nbsp;for an easy-to-reach Rank Zero&nbsp;position that is relevant for your business. For example, I discovered a featured snippet for one of my favorite SEO tool by searching over Google \"What is WooRank?\"understand where the information is coming from, in my case the content on WooRank was extracted from a reviews' website called https://reviews.financesonline.com/ (they do a very good job)contact the website owner and ask for a review as I did for&nbsp;WordLift, our beloved WordPress pluginBum!&nbsp;\"That's right, man. I got in.\" (epic quote from the movie \"Tron Legacy\"). The snippet was created within hours and this was a simple and easy way to train Google on what WordLift really is.&nbsp;Tip #2: Curate Your EntityWhile Rank Zero results are driven by old SEO tactics other snippets are driven by data that Google can truly understand and compute. This information is stored in the Google Knowledge Graph (eventually evolved in the Google Knowledge Vault). This is a large database organized much like our brain in a network of synapsis. These snippets, called knowledge panels,&nbsp;are bound to a Knowledge Graph ID, a unique identifier in the web of data that maps unambiguously the information related to a person, a company or a product. Just to give you an example my Knowledge Graph ID is&nbsp;kg:/m/0djtw2h. A simple query using this ID will show you everything that Google knows about me. These types of results are way more powerful than the results generated using the Rank Zero snippets as they can be computed. The machine knows what it is talking about - it is not just reproposing information scraped from a webpage. The AI now has the data needed&nbsp;to discover other data and learn from it.&nbsp;Here are the steps in this case:look for&nbsp;the&nbsp;Graph ID you need using the Knowledge Graph Search API (here is a good article to walk you though) - if you can't find it - give yourself a new target and build the data you need to get a Graph ID for your entityensure that a consistent representation of the same entity is available in other digital spaces such as social networks, the universal encyclopedia, and your own website or blog&nbsp;remember to add in your structured data markup (on all websites you can control) a direct link to that&nbsp;Graph ID identifier. WordLift does this for you automatically and tells Google \"Hey here we're talking about entity X and here you can find additional information to learn from\". This is very a powerful technique for the so-called semantic search optimizationYes, now the fun begins!Tip #3: Teach Google the right SynonymThe explosion of online information has led to an impressive growth in quantity, diversity, and complexity of linguistic data accessible over the Internet. These resources become way more useful when linked to&nbsp;each other. Today's natural language interfaces&nbsp;and personal assistants leverage on this vast amount of information and benefit from the linked data paradigm. There are already incredibly useful lexical-semantic resources that AI tools and PAs can use by accessing linked data: WordNet, FrameNet as well as general knowledge graphs like DBpedia and Yago represent the foundation of today's computational linguistic. How can you take a spin at these technologies and improve the visibility of your brand?[caption id=\"attachment_4043\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"500\"] Discover \"Bauernherbst\" with Google Allo[/caption]Here is an example that uses structured data markup to help Google Assistant promote&nbsp;a major festival in Salzbugerland whose brand name is a German word (Bauernherbst), to an English speaking audience:start with an entity (in this case an entity of type event that describes to the harvest festival in the region of Salzburg)add the synonym to the entity using the schema.org markupcreate the same entity (and the corresponding web page) in both German and Englishconnect the schema.org linked metadata of the German page with the schema.org metadata of the English page (and you can do all of this with WordLift without any technical skill)Voil\u00e0, magic happens!Tip #4: Hijack your environment and&nbsp;let the PAs do the talkingI remember the first time I saw the Google Glasses at SXSW Festival in 2013. The proud smile depicted on the faces of the very few lucky early adopters and how easy it was to kill their enthusiasm and annoy them to death without even talking to them. As soon as they would pass by with their&nbsp;head-mounted displays, someone nearby would shout ... \"OK Google\" therefore activating the device and requesting them to press a button and stop the talking. We all know now, as Google Assistant has been shipped to all most recent Android devices, how frustrating it is when it gets activated by mistake. Now what if...this is done with a purpose and within the context of an online advertising, a business talk or a presentation? This is what Burger King just did a few days ago to set the Internet on fire and to force&nbsp;Google update all home devices and shut down the assistant-activated ad. Burger King's new 15-second commercial on YouTube triggers Google devices by shouting a voice search query within their promotional video ... \u201cOk Google, what is the Whopper burger?\u201d. Sorry, I just loved that. There have been a lot of understandable complaints and yet, if used properly this is a game changer. Here is how it goes:Make sure you can successfully have the PA talk about you or your preferred entityCreate a podcast or a video that engage the PAs in the room where your video is being watchedAlways avoid being too invasive and remember privacy is important for everyoneTip #5:&nbsp;Claim and Optimize your BusinessBeing successful in the Voice Search world is about strengthening your online presence, focusing on the user intents and making sure content, as well as data, &nbsp;is consistent across the Internet. A lot of people use voice search to get information about local businesses. Sometimes it's quicker from a mobile device (if not absolutely mandatory - if you're driving)&nbsp;to ask your PA to make a call for you or to help you drive on time to a destination. These&nbsp;search queries rely on the accuracy of the business&nbsp;listings and on the consistency of business\u2019s name, address and phone number (NAP).[caption id=\"attachment_4044\" align=\"aligncenter\" width=\"400\"] Hello WordLift. Tap to Call.[/caption]Here is what you need to do to help Google Assistant find your business: Add it to Google My Business, Yelp and Bing Places for Business and remember to choose the&nbsp;right&nbsp;business category &nbsp;Incorporate schema.org markup on your website to tell search engines: yes, this business has this website and yes, this is the business's name, address, and phone number. Schema markup helps PAs truly understand what your business is all about and reinforces the same data you should have already on the various directories.&nbsp;Are you still afraid of&nbsp;how&nbsp;structured data works? WordLift&nbsp;walks you through the process of creating and publishing five-stars linked data in schema.org and including it on your website. Give it a try or schedule a live demo! [wl_navigator]",

        "text": "Looking for truth in the post-truth era: new challenges for the web journalism How is journalism evolving in the digital era? What are the needs, challenges, and opportunities for web journalism in 2017 - and in the years to come? We are interviewing web writers, journalists, and publishers to understand the state of the art of digital journalism and try to predict future trends.\r\rIn the middle of the Nineties, my father used to buy - and read - a newspaper\u00a0two or three times\u00a0a week, plus one or two weekly magazines - and he also watched daily news on TV. In early '00 online media\u00a0started to erode, year after year, the space of printed\u00a0media and television.\u00a0Nowadays most of the information\u00a0diet of the Millennials is based on articles and news published online by several kinds of sources\u00a0and repurposed seamlessly by search engines and social media.\r\rThe publishing industry has evolved more quickly in the last 25\u00a0years than in the\u00a0previous 250.\r\rJournalists and web writers are facing this evolution. Sometimes they're surfing it like a good wave, sometimes they are just overwhelmed. In this article you'll find the opinion of\u00a0three expert web writers who deal with the challenges of online journalism\u00a0in their daily work.\r\rSkip to...\r\r \tAttention is shrinking\r \tWhat happened to the truth?\r \tSEO is a must or...\r \tLong-form articles are coming back\r \tTime management is complicated\r\r1. Attention is shrinking\rWe've lost 4 seconds of our attention span in just 13 years: how long will humans be able to keep attention in 13 years from now?\r\rAccording to a recent study published by Microsoft, human attention span is gradually dropping, year after year: in 2013 average human attention span was around 8 seconds - which means\u00a0that we stay focused for less time than a goldfish!\r\rFor journalists who write articles and want people to read them, this is a real\u00a0challenge: what kind of strategies can you use to keep a high level of attention over your content?\r\rValentina Ferrero, Editor in Chief at Diario Innovazione, has her own recipe:\r\"I use to write emotional articles and I use storytelling techniques to make them appealing. I also link similar stories and deep insights into my text in order to give something more to my reader and engage him within the website.\"\u00a0\rA similar advice comes from Ben Dickson, Software Engineer\u00a0and Contributor at TechCrunch, The Next Web, Venture Beat, and more.\r\"I'm focused on two areas in terms of editorial planning:\r\r \t\rTimely writing: Delivering articles that relate to things that are happening now or will happen in the near future\r\r \t\rEvergreen writing: Articles that will be worth reading for months and possibly years to come.\"\r\r\r2.\u00a0What happened to the truth?\rIn the end of 2016 post-truth was elected 'word of the year' by the Oxford Dictionary, even if\u00a0fake news are not new at all: there have been hoaxes as long as there's been someone reporting news, more or less.\r\rSo what's the point with post-truth?\r\r \tReaders' (bad) habits: today many people only scroll the\u00a0latest news on their smartphones and sometimes they share articles without reading anything but the title\r \tHoax production is easier than ever: if you have a look at the most famous historical hoaxes, you'll notice that - at least - creating a hoax required some effort. Today anyone can produce them with a device connected to the Internet.\r \tThe fear of missing out is forcing digital\u00a0journalists to write more and more news - sometimes regardless to the most elementary fact-checking.\r\rIn this scenario,\u00a0fake news spread like wildfire, and people seem more likely to be engaged by any news which appeals to emotions, rather than actual facts.\r\rToday fake news affect social life, politics and even economics: just as an example, many commentators claim that Trump's election was influenced by fake news about Hilary Clinton. In the latest months, search engines and social media are preparing their weapons to detect and fight fake news.\r\rMeanwhile, media and journalism are losing their trustability, and to gain it back they need to work harder on fact-checking and quality. How?\r\rHere is the experience of Ben Dickson:\r\"I think fake news is not new. Mainstream media has been dabbling in biased reporting and misrepresenting the truth for a long time. Although for the most part, mainstream media don't go as far as bringing up falsified facts (such as the Pope supporting Trump), they do tend to only reflect the part of the story that serves their own end, or quote unnamed and anonymous sources that can't be verified. There is more than one case where top news outlets have reported events in ways that represented or worked towards furthering the political ends of the political party or school of thought they represented.\r\rHowever, with the explosion of social media and online services, fake news has become democratized and it's now within everyone's reach. This is a deeply social, ethical and political issue. There's not consensus on what's true and what's fake. And though I've seen some tools and efforts to fact check and evaluate the reliability of a site's content, I'm not sure if we can develop a tool (or set of tools) that will ultimately rid the web of fake news.\r\rI personally think the truth is out there (wow, X-Files meme!) and I believe reader discretion and research is the key to separating fact from fiction and hype from reality. When I read something for a fact, I always try to find the counter argument and see the other side of the story. I always check a fact from several conflicting sources and then try to find the median. It's tough work, but it's rewarding!\"\rThere\u00a0is also another face of the moon, and I'd like to show it to you through the voice - well, the words - of Alfonso Biondi, Web Content Specialist at Banzai and Co-founder at Lercio, one of the most popular satirical news journals in Italy.\r\"The Lercio-man adores fake news: they're what he can do best after drinking for free. I would like to clear up any misunderstaning: fake news I love and enjoy writing are those with a satirical slant, I'm not talking about hoaxes. Where is the difference? Let's make an example (the same you find on Bufale.net).\r\rTake these two news:\r\r1) Boldrini: \"Disgusted by Referendum's result, I quit politics, you don't deserve me!\"\r\r2) Boldrini: \u201cWe should educate fetuses not to kick their mothers\u201d\r\rBoth news talk about the same person - Laura Boldrini, an Italian politician well-known for her feminist battles - and both are false. So, they are two examples of fake news, right? But, as you can notice, in the first example there's nothing fun, it's just a hoax indeed, a bait for ingenous fishes; in the second case, the satirical intent of the news is obvious, you can't misunderstand it: it's Lercio, baby.\"\r\r3. SEO is a\u00a0must, or...\rDead or alive, SEO is a matter of concern: you need to stay up-to-date and sometimes you feel like you're walking on the thin line of a delicate balance between spam and optimization.\r\rBen's strategy is quite sophisticated:\r\"I mostly focus on content and intent than technical SEO tricks. As far as SEO is concerned, I'm focused on writing human-friendly content and stick to writing best practices (short sentences, active voice, short paragraphs, subheadings...). In some cases, when writing evergreen content, I also do a little keyword research and optimization.\"\rAgain, Valentina agrees with Ben:\r\"I only follow SEO rules for cold, evergreen content, which can attract visits without regard to timing.\"\rSometimes, you can even ignore SEO and still rule the traffic game, here is the experience of Alfonso Biondi:\r\"When I write for Lercio, I enjoy keeping\u00a0SEO in the drawler of the useless things - not far from my gym pass. It's quite obvious: satirical fake news are 100% creative pieces of content, due to their eccenticity and singularity. They just can't be kept in a keyword's cage.\r\rWell, I know that our case is extraordinary in the context of online publishing, where SEO is a primary need in content creation and writing. I know what I'm talking about, since I work as a web content specialist and I\u00a0use to deal with SEO daily.\"\r4. Long-form articles\u00a0are coming back\rFor long years, journalists were convinced that readers don't consume long articles online, but only quick, straight-to-the-point, short content. In the last five years, a countertendency emerged: there is space for successful long-form articles, containing more than 1.000 words - and up to 20.000... that's truly a lot to read! - and often enriched with visual media such as pictures, graphics, and videos.\r\rAs you can see from the Quartz curve, chances of success are at their lowest between 500 and 800 words\r\rA lot of interest over long-form article was raised\u00a0by Kevin Delany, Editor in Chief at Quartz who in 2013 presented the so-called Quartz Curve to explain his editorial choices. This U shaped curve, shows that articles with less than 500 words and articles with more than 800 are more likely to have success.\r\"People read short, fast content on the web\" he said \"and also long-form, analytical pieces. Articles of between 500 and 800 words are too long to be sharable, and too short to be in-depth\"\rIt may look like a contradiction in the context of a shorter attention span.\u00a0To get deeper, we asked\u00a0Ben Dickson, who uses to write\u00a0many long-form articles,\u00a0if this kind of content is a gamble or a winning strategy. Here is his what comes from his experience:\r\"I think that if you start with a strong lede, and structure your article in a compelling way (with smart use of sub-headings and bullet points) you'll be able to cater to the needs of both readers who are looking to skim over the subject and those who would like more in-depth content.\"\r5. Time management is complicated\rWe use to say that writers should write but, actually, they are super-busy with many other activities beyond writing.\r\rIn every newsroom, the lack of time is one of the major complaints - and if you ask freelancers\u00a0their pain is the same, or even harder. This is not an emerging question, but with tons of distractions, a multitude of available sources and - often - even new tasks to accomplish, timing is more crucial than ever.\r\rWe asked Ben, Valentina, and Alfonso what are the activities\u00a0that take them more time and how they deal with them.\rBen: \"I do a lot of research and fact checking for my articles. I like to interview subject experts and corroborate my research with thought leaders and people who have experience and know-how in the domain that I'm exploring. I believe that it slows down my production rate somehow, but it's worth the effort. It forces me to socialize and get in touch with wonderful people. I think this is an important issue in a day and age where Google is trying to answer your every question and social media platforms such as Facebook try to dictate their knowledge to you.\"\rValentina: \"Digital relations, partnerships, and alliances are a must. Like it or not, cooperation in these days counts more than anything else!\"\rAlfonso:\u00a0\"If we agree to keep out of the list of the most time-consuming tasks the keyword cleaning from muffin crumbles, I don't have doubts: the most difficult thing is to turn that 'misterous something' floating in the air in an actual idea you can write about. This is the stage before writing, but here is where writing takes place: the idea before the idea. Besides being the most difficult part, it is also the most beautiful one. Can I have the ice-cream you promised me?\"\rSome key learnings to think about\rWhat did we learn from the experience of these digital journalists?\r\r \tUse emotional writing and storytelling to keep the reader on your page\rYou can also add internal links to help your reader get deeper into his matter of interest: WordLift can do that on the basis of a semantic text analysis, so you'll be able to retrieve old articles - even if they are written by other contributors of the same website.\r \tResearch, fact-checking, and counter arguments: these are the weapons you have in your constant search for the truth.\r \tFocus on writing for humans and optimize\u00a0SEO keywords for evergreen content\rAfter years of online writing under the diktat of machines\u00a0and keyword optimization, focusing on a human-friendly text is actually a good strategy, since also search engines are moving from keyword to natural language processing.\r \tStructure your article to fit the needs of all your readers (those who are just scanning content and those who need some deeper insight)\rWe would also add to this structure the\u00a0entities, as a primary brick to build the meaning and context of your content.\r \tRelations and cooperation count more than ever.\r\rBen, Valentina,\u00a0Alfonso and many other web journalists out there are working really hard in a world that produces data and information like never before, and that's way more complex. Online journalism needs new tools to match the growing need of valuable, trustable information in a World Wide Web which is evolving in the direction of semantics.\r\rMay semantic technologies be the answer?\rA semantic cure for\u00a0online\u00a0journalism\rWell, semantic publishing may not turn the day into 48 hours, but... by automating tagging, on-page\u00a0SEO\u00a0tasks, and categorization, it reduces the amount of manual work\u00a0and helps sparing precious time.\r\rIt can be a valuable content marketing\u00a0strategy to brilliantly overcome many of these challenges turning them into opportunities to shine in the market.\u00a0How?\r\r \tIt enriches\u00a0content with a context and helps publishers build their trustworthiness and find data that can support their writing process.\r \tLinked Data helps engage different kinds of readers with a personalized experience, giving little bits of information to those who need a quick answer and giving many chances of getting deeper in the matter to those who want to learn more.\r \tThe internal vocabulary can be used as a shared knowledge base within the newsdesk, helping journalists to cooperate with their peers.\r\rWanna learn more?\rIf you are curious about semantic publishing, you should give WordLift a try: book a live demo now!",

Let's\u00a0dive into the new changes and see how you can take advantage of them.\r1. User Experience\rThe UX is gonna be slightly different: you'll be able to navigate easily on WordLift's entity categorization to focus on one W at a time and you'll also see fewer icons.\r\rWe wanted to simplify WordLift's use and let you focus on writing: we think sometimes less is better, don't you?\r\rSee how you can navigate through entities. It\u2019s useful, especially for looooong texts.\r2. Link-no-link\rLink-no-link is this easy!\r\rYou now have the power to choose whether to link or not your article to your entity pages\u00a0while adding schema.org markup.\r\rThis new feature is going to change dramatically the way you experience blogging with WordLift: that's why we decided to get deeper into this new feature with a blog post.\rTo link or not to link... here is the question!\r3. Entity Category\rFrom now on, you can add one of your blog's categories to your entities. In this\u00a0way, your entities will be shown on your category pages adding their value to your users' path on your site.\r\rIf you spent a lot of time curating the content of your entities and making them meaningful in the context of your website, they deserve to be reached from several entry points since they really give an extra benefit to your readers.\r\rTo add a category to your entities, just choose a category from the right box.\r\rDon't want to show an entity on a category page? Don't worry, because if you don't add any category to your entity, it won't appear on your category pages, just as any other piece of content.\r4. Customize your Entity Type\u00a0Archive Pages\rSo you want a single page with links to all your archived entities organized by entity type?\u00a0WordLift creates these pages automatically to form the main gateway into your blog's entities (for example you can look through the contents of this blog by looking at the entities type person that can be reach at https://wordlift.io/wl_entity_type/person/). You can now customize the title and description of these\u00a0archive gateways for each type of entities.\r\rFor example, if you talk about literature, it may be useful to define \"persons\" as \"Writers\" and collect all your entities on a new archive index that\u00a0is\u00a0meaningful for your readers and good for SEO purposes.\r\rAdding a category title is super-easy and good for your SEO!\r5. Entity Cloud\rNow you can add to your article an entity cloud, which is pretty much similar to a tag cloud, with the difference that it is linked to your own knowledge graph. In this way, you'll be able to move from tags - which mean nothing to search engines - to entities. Isn't it great?\r\rTo know more about this new widget, read the documentation.\r\rTo add the entity cloud to all your articles go to the Widgets and then drag it where you want.\r6. Add Publisher Information\rAs you may remember, with the previous release of WordLift, new users were able to add information about the publisher whether it is a person or an organization. Now also those clients who were already using WordLift before the 3.10 release can add their publisher information with a\u00a0very easy setup.\r\rSee how it works with the gif below, or read the documentation for further information.\r\rYou can set up a person or an organization as your website publisher\r\rIf you are already using WordLift, we're sure you'll love the opportunities these new features will open. If you are not using it, well, it's probably time to give us a try!",

        "text": "To link or not to link, here is the question... If you are using WordLift for a while, you know that&nbsp;all the magic is based on the creation of entities, on their semantic&nbsp;markup and on the interlinking between articles and entities. It all happens with a few clicks on your WordPress editor, with no need to code anything.Well, we listened to the needs of our clients and we changed something for the better. There is one major change you need to know:&nbsp;you will have the power to choose whether to link or not your article to your entity pages&nbsp;while adding schema.org markup.Whaaaat? This is a big big thing, and so I will let our biz dev Gennaro explain it for me. See this short tutorial for the link-no-link feature.https://youtu.be/Nj22uEJP26wWhy should you add a link to your entity, and why not?Now that you know what and how, let's explore why. To link or not to link, this will be the question&nbsp;from now on. How do&nbsp;you choose?Well, the first thing you should ask yourself is:&nbsp;will this link add a value for your reader or distract him/her?Here is a short list of typical cases we collected from our client's experience and from our own. \tThe most typical case is that you are using an entity which is the very basis of the topic you are exploring and you assume your readers already know&nbsp;it enough. For example, if in this article I used the word website, I could be quite sure that no one of my human readers would need any explanation about such an obvious thing, but search engines' spiders still need it to better understand the context I refer to. \tYou&nbsp;need to markup semantically your article with many entities, but you are afraid that links could distract your readers. Fine, select the entities which are more likely to add something meaningful to your readers' experience and then took off the link from all the others. Think carefully: this is an editorial choice and it's completely up to you! \tAlso, you may have a SEO concern about the number of links on your page. Given that&nbsp;it's a good rule to keep the number of links (both internal and external) below the 100-link mark, you may need to be even more careful while selecting the entities that will be linked to their own pages. Try not to have too many links to the entities per article, and - of course - try not too have to many links at all. \tFinally, sometimes you annotate your text with entities, but you don't have the time to curate the new entity pages before publishing your article. This may happen because in some cases timing is crucial for your content to reach a broader audience. In this kind of situation, you'll better add semantic&nbsp;markup to your article without a link to the entity&nbsp;pages. You can always add links later -when you'll add some piece of information to your entity pages; until then&nbsp;remember to use \"no-index\" for those incomplete entity pages.What if - instead - you'd like to give your readers the opportunity to go deeper into some entity, but don't want them to leave your article? Well, we are also thinking about that...How to embed the content of an entity into your articleAs you may know, our entities are represented as JSON-LD objects - the format suggested by Google - this means that any time you create an entity you are publishing data which can be reused and which - da-dan! - is layout-independent, so the entity can adapt itself&nbsp;to the style of your website. Pretty cool, uh?See the Pen Parsing JSON-LD by Nicola Bertelloni (@wanbinkimoon) on CodePen&nbsp;: switching to HTML, you can see a simple code you can use to embed the content of any entity (we used WordPress) to your article or web page.At the moment, this is quite a nerdy solution, which requires little coding expertise and some customization, but... we are working on an easier and faster solution within WordPress&nbsp;editor!Stay tuned!",

        "text": "Is your website ready for voice search? Find it out with this handy checklist! Just a few years ago, voice-activated technology sounded like science fiction, it reminded us of\u00a0Star Trek's iconic characters commanding their computers with just\u00a0their voices. Now it's 2017 and\u00a0voice search is real and going to stay: in 2016\u00a0Google voice search has been used 35 times more than in 2008, according to Google Trends. What is even more impressive is that 60% of people who frequently use\u00a0voice search have started only last year - the data was gathered by\u00a0MindMeld, who ran a survey on the adoption of voice assistants in year 2016. We are facing the adoption of a fast-growing technology which will reshape\u00a0the way we experience\u00a0the web.\r\rVoice search became more and more sophisticated in the past few years, and its latest developments have brought it in our pockets in the form of virtual assistants like Google Assistant,\u00a0Siri and\u00a0Cortana, and in our homes in the form of home assistants such as Amazon Echo, which was unpacked by a lot of American families last Christmas, and the newborn Google Home.\rWhy are\u00a0Internet\u00a0users adopting voice search?\r\r \tIt finally works!\u00a0The error rate\u00a0in speech recognition is getting close to zero.\u00a0Andrew Ng has long predicted that as speech recognition goes from 95% accurate to 99% accurate, it will become a primary way that we interact with computers. This 4% accuracy gap is the difference between annoyingly unreliable and incredibly useful. Thanks to deep learning, we\u2019re finally cresting that peak.\r \tIt's fast and simple. Most people speak faster than they type. That's a fact. So, when you are in a hurry, it would be much easier to speak to a virtual assistant and get the answer you were looking for straight away. Also, when searching the web by typing a query you have to evaluate the results and pick the one that comes from the most relevant source (probably between those in first SERP), if you are not satisfied with the results, you will have to narrow down your research by adding more keywords to the query. It requires some time and experience. Since virtual assistants are becoming more and more conversational, the voice search process is now simpler and more user-friendly: it resembles a natural conversation where the virtual assistant keeps track of previous questions and replies accordingly.\r \tIt's multitasking-friendly. Say you are\u00a0at home cooking an apple pie and you just need to know how many eggs you need or you are driving to the venue of some event which is about to begin and you are not sure about the fastest route. In both cases, voice search can help you giving the information you need while you are busy doing something else and without using your hands!\r \tIt's mobile-friendly. Anywhere, anytime, our virtual assistants are in our pockets, just a voice command away. Most times, thanks to instant answers, you don't even need to read something on your device, you just get the right answer... in zero time!\r\rA 5 steps checklist to write effective content for voice search\r1. Answer questions (and do it accurately)\rMany voice searches are questions which start with\u00a0the 5W + H (in case you don't remember from your school days they are Who, What, When, Where, Why and How). Usually, the answers to questions which start with Who, What, When and Where are a single piece of information that can be isolated: that is why\u00a0Google and Intelligent Agents tend to answer this kind of questions with instant answers. Owning or being the result picked as instant answer is a strategic asset (the so-called\u00a0Rank Zero case).\r\rWordLift offers you the chance to structure your content assigning a role to each piece of information using\u00a0the Who, What, When and Where categories.\r2. Make your content easy to read\rOrganize the content of your page with subtitles, bullet points, tables, and some highlights: it will help machines understand the content on your page. Also, remember that many people tend to quickly scan a page before actually reading it: a neat content organization of your page will help your hasty readers and give them a reason to thoroughly\u00a0read your\u00a0article.\r3. Optimize for mobile and local\u00a0search\rMost times, voice search comes from mobile devices. Keep it in mind and consider that a mobile friendly website is crucial for your SEO. Let's take a step forward and think about how proximity could eventually change the relevance of your content. If you own a local activity, it probably does:\u00a0think about how your products or services may help people around you and structure your content accordingly.\r\rThink about the needs of people walking nearby your office and feed them with useful information that relates to your business.\r4. Add schema.org markup\r\rGoogle Assistant has no doubts: WordLift is the best answer for those who are looking for a SEO plugin that uses semantic technologies. ?\r\rSchema.org markup helps you adding a context to your content: you can use it to explicit the relations between information in your content, to disambiguate the words you are using and to give structure to your pages. When using schema.org markup you are communicating with machines through semantics instead of keywords:\u00a0you are helping machines to define the context around an information so that it will turn into useful results for humans.\r\rWordLift\u00a0creates a knowledge graph and adds Schema.org markup to your content: this is actually one of the main strength points of our plugin, learn more in this article.\r5. Embrace everyday language\r\rDo you think that average users talk to their virtual assistants with complicated, hyper-specialized words? Wrong! They will most likely use everyday language or even slang to ask questions. So, more than ever, remember the KISS principle: \"keep it simple, stupid!\".\u00a0Ask yourself what would\u00a0users who know\u00a0nothing or nearly nothing about the topic you are writing about would search, and then write for them.\rEinstein used to say: \"If you can't explain it simply you don't understand it well enough\".\rMoving from keywords to semantics\rThe rise of\u00a0voice search trend is just the tip of the iceberg: search engines are slightly moving from keywords to semantics and natural language processing is heading towards human-centric results. It's not just happening on voice search, it's true for any kind if search, especially on Google.\r\rSince fall 2013, thanks to the algorithm known as Google Hummingbird, SERPs have been more and more populated with results which take into account context information such as the kind of device used, geolocation, time of the day, previous searches and more. To give each user the best results, Google is also using a machine\u00a0learning technology called RankBrain, which is the third signal in order of importance contributing to the results of each search. RankBrain is used mainly to interpret the searches in order to find pages that offer a good answer for\u00a0users, but might not have the exact words that were searched for. It clearly relies on semantics since it goes beyond keywords and gets deeper into the contextual meaning of the search.\r\rWhen using context information, search engines serves more relevant results to users, picking the answers which seem to be more accurate and case-specific. Considering the biggest picture, voice search is one more reason for content creators to focus on content structure and rethink each page or article as an answer for\u00a0specific personas.\r\rWordLift gives content marketers the opportunity to focus on writing while it does the techy job and gives structure to your\u00a0article with metadata.\r\r",

        "text": "Why RankBrain will make your blog worthless, unless... Our ancestors in the Savannah developed larger and larger brains that allowed them to communicate effectively.\r\rWhether language came as side effect of larger brains or it was actually our ability to communicate that made our brain larger, the main point is, humans, strive for clarity!\r\rOne of the most powerful way humans use to deepen their understanding of the world is by asking questions.\r\rIn an interview to one of the greatest scientists of our times, Richard Feynman, he was explaining how magnetism worked, when the journalist suddenly asked,\r\"Why are they doing it?\"\rReferring to why magnets attract each other.\r\rThat seemingly simple question made Feynman flinch for a few seconds.\r\rNot because the question was naive. Quite the opposite, it was so powerful that it knocked him down.\r\rIn other words, when we ask questions, we want an answer that is clear and straight to the point.\r\rAlthough scientific answers are complex by nature.\r\rSimple questions, such as \"who is the president of the United States?\" are simple and require a direct answer.\r\rYet it has not been the way the web worked so far.\r\rWhy? Because machines did not understand human language.\r\rTherefore, in order to make the content on your blog findable, you had to adjust it so that machines could index it.\r\rThings are changing quite fast, though. Machines' ability to understand human language has improved remarkably.\r\rHow? Thanks to natural language processing (NLP).\r\rWhy is that relevant to your blog? Let's see\u2026\rHow Google works in a nutshell\rhttps://youtu.be/BNHR6IQJGZs\r\rAs Matt Cutts, engineer at Google, explains, when you do a search on Google, \"you are not searching the web but Google's index of it\".\r\rIn short, software programs called spiders crawl the web, trying to make sense of what they find, and index few pages out of billions of pages to answer your Google searches.\r\rDeciding whether a page is relevant, therefore it needs to be indexed is not an easy task.\r\rAs Matt Cutts explains, those \"little spiders\" try to answer more than two-hundred questions, such as:\rHow many times does this page contain your keyword? \rDo they appear in the title? Do they appear in the URL?\rThis list of questions goes on and on, until Google finally delivers a result in less than a second!\r\rBut if the exact formula Google uses to index web pages is as secret as Coca-Cola's recipe - meaning that we all talk about it but none really knows what's in it - a revolution happened.\rThe Hummingbird that changed the net\rIn September 2013 a new search platform - Hummingbird - came out.\r\rWithin this search platform, a new algorithm, called RankBrain became a major player.\r\rOut of the more than 200 hundreds factors that Google accounts for when deciding whether the content on your blog is relevant RankBrain has become the third-most important signal contributing to the result of a search query.\r\rBut let\u2019s take a short step back to see how it works!\rA word is not an island\rIf I pick two random nouns, such as \u201cSocrates\u201d and\u00a0\u201cPlato\u201d in your mind you are already building a set of relationships.\r\rChances are you already thought that Socrates was Plato\u2019s teacher. Also that Socrates is an ancient greek philosopher. We cannot help it!\r\rWhy? Because humans think in terms of relationships among concepts.\r\rYet that is not what machines used to do. Until RankBrain changed it all!\r\rRankBrain looks more at the relationship between concepts and words rather than a single word or keyword.\r\rThe machine learning algorithm learns to understand what you write based on contextual information and the network of concepts it meets along the way.\r\rIn short, a word is not an island, but it gets relevance based on the context it sits on.\rThe Power of context\rAs SEO strategist Gianluca Fiorelli puts it in RankBrain unleashed:\r\"What we should do is insist on optimizing our content using semantic SEO practices (emphasis mine), in order to help Google understand the context of our content and the meaning behind the concepts and entities we are writing about.\"\rTo make your content relevant it is crucial to have a change of paradigm.\r\rKeywords are not enough. What can you do? Let\u2019s find out!\rHow to make machines understand the classics\rAthens 399 B.C.: a chubby man, with a long white beard was standing in front of a jury. We are in Athens, the most developed city at the time. Yet that man was ready to be sentenced to death.\r\rHe was not afraid, and although he was in a risky situation he spoke his mind until the last instant. That man was Socrates, and that trial is portrayed in Plato\u2019s \u201cApology of Socrates\u201d.\r\rEven though this is the most moving trial ever told, Google wasn\u2019t able to understand it before Hummingbird unleashed RankBrain!\r\rIndeed, if you were to use the classic approach to SEO, you would stuff your article with keywords (like you would do with a Thanksgiving\u2019s turkey) hoping that one day Google understood it!\r\rFor how crazy that sounds, it is what many experts would do! But isn\u2019t there a better way? Yes, that is!\r\rFor instance, that is what Wikipedia says about the \u201cApology of Socrates\u201d:\r\u201cThe Apology of Socrates, by Plato, is the Socratic dialogue that presents the speech of legal self-defence, which Socrates presented at his trial for impiety and corruption, in 399 BC.\rSpecifically the Apology of Socrates is a defense against the charges of \u201ccorrupting the young\u201d and \u201cnot believing in the gods in whom the city believes, but in other daimonia that are novel\u201d to Athens.\u201d\rAs a human, this text is pretty straightforward. Yet to make it comprehended by machines we have to take an additional step.\rGoogle finally meets Socrates\rI took Wikipedia\u2019s text and edited it with WordLift and that is what I got:\r\r\r\rFirst, as soon as I placed the text in my WordPress editor and saved it as a draft, WordLift started to analyze it semantically. In short, WordLift understood\u00a0what I wrote thanks to NLP.\r\rSecond, on the right side, WordLift classified the content of my post under the \u201cWhat, where, when and who\u201d and extracted the relevant entities. What is an entity? An entity is a page that is structured semantically, thus understood not only by humans but also by search engines.\r\rThird, WordLift suggested a set of entities (such as Apology, Classical Athens, Daemon, Plato, Socrates and Socratic Dialogue) that would help me to tell the story both to humans and machines.\r\rWith a click, I selected the entities classified by WordLift and saved the article. WordLift marked my content through schema.org, and made it readable to machines!\r\rHow do I know? \r\rWithin my editor WordLift makes available a box, that says \u201cView Linked Data\u201d.\r\r\r\rOnce I click on it, and take an additional step I can see how the information I placed in my editor is reshaped until it became organized knowledge.\r\r\r\rIn short, the information I wrote in the article was reshaped and organized in a set of nodes and edges. Where the nodes are the articles and entities. While the edges are the relationships between those articles and entities. \r\rWhy is that relevant? \r\rThat knowledge is now accessible to both humans (in the form of text) and machines (in the form of schema.org markup).\r\rIn other words, without placing a single keyword in my post I managed to explain the \u201cApology of Socrates\u201d to my new friend, Google!\r\rThe only caveat is to structure your content by creating Entities rather than keywords!\rThe Evolution of SEO: from keyword to Entity\rThroughout this article, we saw a few very interesting points. \r\rFirst, humans use questions to communicate. Yet we expect answers that are clear and straightforward. Paradoxically, though, that is not the way the web worked until recently. \r\rSecond, machines didn\u2019t understand human language. Yet a revolution happened in 2013, when Hummingbird unleashed RankBrain. \r\rThird, now thanks to semantic web, humans and machines are on the same page. Yet to take advantage of this revolution, you have to stop thinking about keywords and start creating Entities!\r\rDo you want to create your first entity?

        "text": "Case Study: content marketing for a successful small business | Tao Roma Meet Tao Roma\rTao Roma promotes personal development starting from ancient Chinese\u00a0disciplines such as\u00a0Tai Chi Chuan, Qi Gong, and Taoist Alchemy, bringing them to the contemporary life.\r\rHis founder, Oscar Valentini, is a martial art, Tai Chi Chuan,\u00a0Qi Gong, and Taoism teacher. He comes from Rome, Italy, and his blog\u00a0Tao Roma is a focal point for the promotion of his work. We asked Oscar\u00a0what kind of business goals he was trying to achieve with his blog when he first started it, and his answer was quite interesting:\r\"It was 2013 and goals was quite a strong word. It started by chance, because I wanted to spread my knowledge about Tao wellness techniques. Blog articles and Facebook shares immediatly worked powerfully to disseminate content and engage with people online. At the time, my main goal was to make people curious to experience how ancient Tao wisdom can impact on their lives with a little personal commitment.\"\rAnd then, in the end of 2015, Oscar was one of the early beta testers of WordLift. What did it change\u00a0on the blog results?\r\"Wordlift was revolutionary: for a while I stopped writing new articles, and worked on my own vocabulary of core concepts, the so-called entities. Then, I edited many of my articles to connect them with those crucial concepts - which where implicit when I first wrote my blog posts. When these concepts were published as web pages and linked to the articles and to each other, they allowed me to build a knowledge graph into my blog. While I was writing, I din't even get how essential this change was going to be, but then everything became clearer. Now I better understand the importance of a consistent editorial plan thanks to the content organization that\u00a0WordLift allowed me to see and live into my blog.\"\rAnd talking about the results...\r\"In time, WordLift effect also impacted on our results: I reached more people, who are interested in our offer of activities and courses, and I noticed great improvements in SEO. Today, when somebody calls me to offer a SEO consultancy, I always say that there is already someone working on it, but I never say it's a software!\"?\rHow WordLift supported Tao Roma with content marketing\rSince December 2015, Oscar used WordLift to support his articles with a meaningful galaxy of terms and definitions that could be useful for those who are approaching\u00a0martial art, Tai Chi\u00a0Chuan,\u00a0Qi Gong, and\u00a0Taoism for the first time. Each of these terms\u00a0is an entity and is part of an internal vocabulary\u00a0which helps people - and machines as well, such as search engine's spiders - to understand the referral context.\r\rUntil now, Oscar created 142 entities, represented as linked data in the JSON-LD format thanks our plugin. These entities are linked to DBpedia with the 'sameAs' property and are described through the\u00a0schema.org vocabulary: since they are connected to the web of data, they inherit some properties from DBpedia and schema.org that provides search engines with the required meaning and context. The more entities he created, the more he reinforced the connection between Tao Roma's website and its specific semantic domain.\r\rIn the histogram below, you can see the 50 most recurring entities of Tao Roma's vocabulary and discover how many articles and other entities are connected with them.\r\r\r\rIn the pie graph below, you can see the content classification of the entities inherited from DBpedia. Notice that one of the main topics of the blog is Tao Massage and this can explain why so many entities are classified as anatomical structure.\r\r\r\r\rGot it, now show me the numbers!\rHere is a diagram from SEMrush describing the organic increase Oscar has experienced on his blog thanks to the WordLift effect.\r\r\r\rThe overall results have been impressive and way beyond our expectations. Let\u2019s look more closely at the metrics to understand why organizing your website with structured data matters:\r\r \tNew users from Google (organic search) - Oscar installed the plugin and started to organize the content architecture of his website in December 2015: since then the website received a 42+% increase of new users coming from Google\u2019s organic search.\r\r \tPageviews - We went from a monthly average of 5.662 pageviews in September, October and November 2015 to a monthly average of 14.699 pageviews in the months of December 2015, January and February 2016. This is an 88+% increase (in the last three months since writing this article the monthly average of pageviews is up to 17.368 - so the effect is continuing at a stable rate) - this is an interesting metric but as we know, it is way too generic to help us get a clue on what we\u2019re doing right.\r \tNew sessions from organic search - Comparing to a\u00a0benchmark of 26.686 websites worldwide in the sport vertical (with daily sessions ranging between 100-499),\u00a0Tao Roma's Analytics showed\u00a0a +36,22% (80,03% vs an average of 58,75%) of new sessions coming from organic search.\r \tSitelinks -\u00a0As you probably already know, guiding visitors of your website is a great advantage provider. These links are displayed on the SERP and highlight the main sections of the website, improving brand reputation and user trust. Sitelinks cannot be added by webmasters. They are the result of a well-structured website and the first thing that proves how well a website is organized.\r \tDwell time - Three months after the creation of the initial vocabulary, the average time spent on page increased of 17.27%. This metric certifies an authentic interest from user's side.\r\rToday, thanks to this impressive results,\u00a0Oscar is looking further and thinking about the next revolution for his website...\r\"Our website is going to be transformed again from the graphic and UX point of view - moving from a blog look and feel to an actual online magazine, where we'll see different home pages based on the season of the year and on our calendar of events and initiatives. This flexibility is also a consequence of the strong\u00a0contribution of WordLift to the content writing and structuring process.\"",

        "text": "How to add Schema markup to WordPress If you are a web content writer, there is no need to remind you all the struggle you have to face to distribute\u00a0your content. Maybe you spend hours - or even days! - of hard work writing awesome content, but once your article is done, you know that your job has just begun. Now it's time to fine-tune your content\u00a0for SEO purposes, share it on several channels, monitor search keywords for your next article...\u00a0Wouldn't be wonderful to just\u00a0focus on writing and nothing more?\r\rSemantic markup is the key to success. Schema markup can really help your pages get the traffic they deserve. How? To explain it, we need to do a few steps back: first of all, you need to know what schema.org is.\rWhat is schema.org markup\rSchema.org is an initiative launched in 2011 by the world\u2019s largest\u00a0search engines (Bing, Google, and Yahoo!) to implement a shared vocabulary and adopt standard formats to structure data on web pages.\r\r\rSchema.org markup helps machines understand your content, without fail or ambiguity.\u00a0\r\rLet's explore how to use the Schema markup, the benefits of using it and how it can be implemented on your WordPress website.\rHow to add Schema.org markup to WordPress\rTo use schema markup on your pages, you can either use a tool like WordLift or do it manually.\rWordLift plugin enables you to add Schema markup on WordPress without writing a single line of code. Once you configured the plugin, a new menu will appear on the right side of your article in the WordPress editor: it will allow you to annotate your content and, by doing so, to create an internal vocabulary to your website or blog.\r\r\r\rWordLift uses JSON-LD to inject schema.org markup in your web pages. Click here to see the magic: it's a gif which shows you the data representation of this article with JSON-LD!\r\rImagine you have published an event on your website: once you completed creating your specific content, the final step will be to add a normal meta description, which will appear on the search page as plain text. But, by adding Schema markup to the page, you can really help your content stand out by transforming it into a rich snippet and therefore getting a lot more clicks ?\r\rThere are several types of schema you can use to mark your content, and by using the\u00a0event schema markup is possible to show dates, locations and any other detail related to a specific event to help people easily get access to all the information they might need:\r\r\r\rOnce the purpose of adding structured data is clear\u00a0 \u2013 that is to provide accurate information about what your content's website is about, you could also see that\u00a0adding Schema markup to your site really is a highly-customizable process.\rHow to increase your traffic with semantic markup\rWhile crawling the web looking for some specific content to be served to users, search engines will unquestionably identify the context your articles belong to. Nowadays this is the most effective and affordable way to distribute your content and made it \"findable\" to those who are looking for it through Search Engines.\r\r\r\rThe example above shows the results of a long-tail\u00a0search about the upcoming Salzburgerland Party Meeting\u00a0event.\u00a0As you can see, the first result is a rich snippet with 2\u00a0links and allows you to skip directly to the next events. All that is made possible by the markup, which helps\u00a0search engines detect the structured data matching the user's answer inside the whole website. It's been proven that rich snippets increase the Click Trough Rate: so, more qualified traffic for you, here!\r\rSalzburgland.com uses WordLift to structure its content.\r\rMoreover, you can explore new ways to disseminate\u00a0your content based on chatbots, which can serve your just-baked articles to your readers depending on their interests.\r\rIn the image on the right side, you can see how Intelligent Agents such as Google Allo can answer your voice search questions with appropriate content if they are correctly structured.\r\rTo learn more, read this useful article about\u00a0how to set-up your first chatbot.\r\r&nbsp;\rAssess markup quality with Google's Structured Data Testing Tool\rOnce you added your schema markup to WordPress, it's easy to determine that everything was done right, simply by using the Structured Data Testing Tool made available by Google. Just enter the URL you need to analyze and let the tool verify your content.\r\r\r\rLet's see, as an example, the markup of the SEMANTiCS 2018 Conference on our blog:\r\r\r\rAs we can see, everything worked just fine, there's only 1 warning about the field Offer that in this case has no value added.\r\rThe first rule while adding schema markup is to be clear. Google will know!\u00a0Also, remember that adding schema\u00a0markup to your page might as well not guarantee any result at first. But it\u2019s always recommended to do it because it can definitely give you the best chance for success in SERPs, and help increase your CTR.\rAutomating structured data markup with WordLift\rWhile developing\u00a0WordLift plugin, we focused on making more accurate than ever our schema.org markup.\rNow we can say - without fear of contradiction\u00a0- that our Plugin offers you one of the most extended sets of markup to structure data on a WordPress website...\u00a0without writing a single line of code!\rSince our 3.10 release, WordLift made a lot of improvements and, as the\u00a0SEO specialist\u00a0Jarno Van Driel\u00a0also said (by the way, thanks a lot for your support, Jarno!) our blue plugin generates\u00a0beautiful 5-star - schema.org powered - linked data graphs.\r\rHere is a list of improvements on the markup that SEO specialists are going to appreciate:\r\r \tARTICLE: we've added the markup schema.org:Article\u00a0for each article/blog post, publishing it with the property Main Entity of Page. Simply put: we say to Google and to the other search engines that this web page is an article. To know more about this property, read this how-to by Jarno Van Driel.\r \tPUBLISHER: we also communicate the publisher's information related to each article as structured data. The publisher can be an individual with his/her proper\u00a0name or an organization with a brand name and a logo.\r \tID: with WordLift we also made available the Publisher ID.\u00a0What is an ID, and why it is so important? For each entity, article, and publisher, we generate a permanent ID: a\u00a0unique identifier which is\u00a0fundamental in the context of 5 stars\u00a0Linked Data\u00a0because it allows the connections between data on the web. Each entity, article, and publisher can be connected to other data, hosted - for example - in WikiData, with the \"same as\" property and each of them can also be decoded with a\u00a0JSON-LD data representation.\r \tRELATED ENTITIES: we used the meta tag \"mentions\" to say which entities are mentioned.\u00a0In this way, you'll have a hierarchy or entities where the main one defines the article itself and the other ones are recognized as mentioned on it.\r\r&nbsp;\r\rTo play around with JSON-LD markup that WordLift created for this article head straight to the JSON-LD Playground.\r\r\r\r&nbsp;\r\r&nbsp;\r\r&nbsp;",

        "text": "Play Copy: 12 tips to write better content for your brand Pen on one hand, smartphone on the other: this Saturday at Play Copy we tweeted and took notes at a double speed, trying to grab the best tips and tricks from some expert Italian copywriters and content marketers. While Gennaro, Andrea, and Beatrice were\u00a0at our desk, showing WordLift to those who write for a living, I\u00a0was in the classroom, learning some good advice from this big conference. In this post, you'll find\u00a0some key takeaways about copywriting, plus one bonus tip.\r\rWe are really proud of having sponsored this inspiring, rich, funny event. Our biggest thanks goes to Pennamontata for planning Play Copy!\u00a0I\u00a0hope reading this post\u00a0you'll feel like you were there at the Spazio Talent Garden just like us.\rLESSON ONE: STORYTELLING\rCarlotta Politano\r\rSocial media manager at LAV,\u00a0the most important non-profit organization in Italy which defends the rights of all animals, Carlotta showed us her point of view on storytelling and then delighted all the copywriters in the room with the touching but still funny story of a big family of macaques, #imagnifici16.\r\rSome lessons that we've learned with Carlotta:\r\r \tIn storytelling, emotions are the key to the heart\u00a0of your public: anger, joy, sadness, wonder.. there is a wide range of feelings that we can use to\u00a0touch people. Choosing an emotional key is the first step to catching your target attention.\r \tNever - ever! - forget your target: try to create a connection between humans, because - in the end - whether if you're trying to connect for business or non-profit reasons, it's all about building relationships which bind people to your story.\r \tYou can animate people to stand up by your side even with some humor: you don't need to use pain and sadness all the time. Sometimes a laugher is the strongest way to your target heart.\r\rLESSON TWO: CRISIS MANAGEMENT\rValentina Falcinelli\r\rCopywriter and mom of Pennamontata, the agency that organized Play Copy, Valentina helped us to understand the difference between a not-so-relevant banana peel and a real crisis. While banana peels make you fall but don't hurt so much your business, actual crisis are like shitstorms which affect your brand reputation and - even worse! - your revenues.\r\rWhich is the right way to face a crisis?\r\r \tDon't\u00a0minimize:\u00a0see your problem for what it really is, because playing it down will not help you to keep the score.\r \tTake your responsibility: be true, and admit your mistakes. If you're able to be honest with that, you can handle your motivations and proof your real intentions.\r \tApologize: sorry may be the hardest word to say, but it\u00a0will help you to raise your head up. Don't be an ostrich!\r \tEmpathize: try to understand the heart of the matter. It may be some deep and hidden value that you've hit unwittingly.\r \tKeep your promises: respect your values and keep your promises\u00a0to fix the issue.\r\rLESSON THREE: SIMPLIFY YOUR TEXT\rLeonardo Luccone\r\rWhen Leonardo Luccone, Director at Oblique Studio, steps in the classroom every typo starts to shake. Mordacious and immediate, Leonardo gave us the best advice to write a better business profile: simplicity is elegance.\u00a0\r\rThen, quoting Flaubert, he said that since words matter, there is no reason to describe ourselves with\u00a0words that belong to someone else. His point was: in a world that seems crowded with people with a similar educational and professional background, the only way to stand out of the crowd is to highlight your individual characteristics and passions.\r\r\rLESSON FOUR: WRITE GOOD BUSINESS E-MAILS\rAnnamaria Anelli\r\rSometimes, you just need ten minutes to nurture your relations - and your business - in the right way. Annamaria Anelli focused on those e-mails you\u00a0need to write in uncomfortable situations, such as replying to an important message while you are out of office, apologizing for a late reply or saying no to a potential new client because you are too busy.\r\rHere are some good tips that you can also apply to other uncomfortable communications:\r\r \tBut sounds like a bad word: try to reverse its role in the phrase putting the bad news before it and the good one after. The phrase will end with a good message, that will stay up in your reader's mind.\r \tUse the kiss-kick-kiss technique: put a bad news between two nice ones to make its effect a little softer.\r \tBe simple, concrete, personal: talk to your reader referring to his/her real case and suggest something to do next.\r\rLESSON FIVE: MEASURE YOUR STORY\rPaolo Zanzottera\r\rHow can you talk about numbers, data, and metrics with those who write for a living? A hard challenge, but Paolo Zanzottera, board member of ShinyStats and co-founder of Appocrate, managed it with talking clearly and walking miles and miles on the carpet under its feet.\r\rThere were two important lessons in its talk:\r\r \tContent is not king. You need to exchange it with a\u00a0triumvirate: design, content, and distribution.\r \tBuyers personas should resemble as much as possible to actual customers with all their imperfections, day-by-day struggles, hard times and so on.\r\rLESSON SIX: BUILD AN EDITORIAL PLAN\rFederica Fiorillo\r\rSocial media manager at BPER Banca, Valentina Fiorillo\u00a0tells us how to create an editorial plan for LinkedIn; she shares the stage with Valentina Falcinelli, who worked on the strategy.\r\rLesson learned: you can always use simple\u00a0words, even if you are a bank!\rLESSON SEVEN: THE IRONIC WAY TO SAY IT\rNicola Bonora\r\r\r\rThe mind behind Mentine,\u00a0Nicola Bonora, has a lot to say about irony: when he shows up, most of the public laughs. Though, he said, \"irony is a serious thing\". When you use an ironic statement you are building with your public an\u00a0understanding based on\u00a0smartness and on a common cultural background. And, in fact, he trained us with some examples and exercises to prove that irony is a combination of technique, culture, and creativity. To practice irony you can do these three things:\r\r \tStart with what you know best: yourself. Using self-irony also helps you see yourself from a different perspective.\r \tBuild an apparent incongruity: use a contradiction that actually brings a deeper meaning.\r \tPractice on puzzle solving\u00a0to improve your lateral thinking.\r\rLESSON EIGHT: KEEP THE MAGIC GOING\rWalter Klinkon\r\rMagician and motivational coach, Walter left all the classroom breathless with its inspired talk. His main advice? Believe in you giving yourself\u00a0the chance to go for the things you really want.\rLESSON NINE: FICTIONAL NEWS AND JOKES\rAlfonso Biondi\r\rAlfonso Biondi, one of the most sarcastic writers of Lercio,\u00a0a well-known Italian journal of fictional news, helped us understand the difference between fictional news and fake ones\u00a0and shared with us some good tips to write jokes that work.\r\rAccording to Alfonso...\r\r \tFictional news are\u00a0built on a paradox and bring a message. While fake news are written to be confused with real ones, fictional news will surprise you opening a new level of meaning.\r \tIn classic jokes the assumption is true, while in fictional news you sometimes don't have any assumptions or you have a false one.\r \tRhythm\u00a0matters: the surprise, which makes you laugh, should be at the end of a\u00a0joke. It has to blow your mind away, literally!\r\rLESSON TEN: BRANDING AND COPYWRITING\rCarlotta Silvestrini\r\rThe branding expert Carlotta Silvestrini\u00a0talks about what words can do for brands. What is the relation between branding and copywriting? For Carlotta, finding the right words\u00a0means leveraging on values that say something unique about the brand. It's not a case that her number one rule is:\r\r\"Read again your copy. If it works for one of your competitors, it's not good for you.\"\rLESSON ELEVEN:\u00a0STAY WITH YOUR SIMILARS\rDaniela Montieri and Elena Pavoncello\r\rThe founders of Associazione Italiana Copywriter, the national copywriters association, showed us the good reasons why copywriters should stand together for their rights.\u00a0Word Power!\rLESSON ELEVEN:\u00a0WRITE AS YOU LIVE\rSarah McCartney\r\rOnce\u00a0copywriter, then novelist, now scent maker, Sarah McCartney has a lot of inspiring experience to share. Her rules\u00a0smell good like her scents, because she deeply understands writing as a consequence of deeply understanding humans.\r\r \tBe kind: make your text easy for your readers. There is no need for difficult words when you can use simpler ones. And keep your punctuation perfectly clean to make your phrases more understandable.\r \tUnderstand your reader: nobody likes to be treated like a demographic data. Be real, and think about the real life of the persons you are going to meet with your words.\r \tGive a soul to your words: if yours doesn't fit the case, borrow the one of someone you know.\r\rLESSON TWELVE: ORGANIZE YOUR CONTENT\rBonus tip\r\rIf you get to this point through this long article, you have to be really interested in copywriting... so, we think that you'll love this final tip from us. We are not focused on writing, but we think that you should... and we can stay by your side! We know your struggle when you write for blogs and websites and you are supposed to follow a lot of SEO rules, which distract you from your job.

        "text": "How to survive 2017 with your blog: a conversation with Luca Conti Rapid changes are transforming the online media industry, demanding new evolutions to editorial teams, bloggers and content writers.\r\rLast November, the Oxford English Dictionary chose post-truth as Word of the Year 2016, an adjective that can be used to denote those \u201ccircumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief\u201d. On the other hand, Ev Williams, Medium's Founder and CEO, was forced to fire one-third of his company's employees a few weeks ago. Williams stated that Medium is still looking for a model that fits the aim of promoting quality content (and make money out of it).\r\rMeanwhile, more challenges are becoming tangible for web content writers: according to Google today voice search\u00a0covers 20% of mobile queries, new potential threats to the open web such as Google AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) are raising questions and doubts, and new web search algorithms that resemble more and more our natural language are desperately scanning sites for high-quality content. In this scenario, many questions come out, and could be summed up with: what\u2019s the future of blogs? How should they evolve in a transforming and challenging web?\r\rWe had the chance to discuss these themes with Luca Conti: a well-known Italian blogger, web marketing consultant, author of many books, and professor at Milano-Bicocca. We met him last December at the WordPress Meetup in Rome and, back then, in his talk Luca presented us his clear vision of the future of the Web.\r\rS. As you said many times, content marketers should strive to answer the questions that are relevant to users. Nowadays, figuring out the question seems even more important than the answer itself, doesn't it?\r\rL. Predicting users' question helps to better promote a valuable answer. Choosing the right words and working with web analytics tools to spot all the hidden needs are starting points of the process of content-crafting, truly relevant to readers. When an answer meets a real need, then the goal is fulfilled.\r\rS. We dwell in the fluid context of post-truth, where facts appear less important to public opinion than emotions and personal beliefs. What would you suggest to those who want to start a blog in 2017?\r\rL. Engage your readers, speak both to their emotional mind and to the rational one. Empathy and sense of humor always help when trying to walk in your reader's shoes. Choosing the right words in the right way, also definitely helps. It may seem easy, but it's not easy at all. The first gap to fill is learning specific skills and applying them in your writing. When you have filled that gap, your new writing and understanding of the topic will grow your readership in a context where attention is scarce.\r\r\r\rS. According to your experience, is there a way to create an economic value through a blog?\r\rL. I keep on firmly believing that a blog is capable of contributing to create value: never underestimate the social side of the web, especially Facebook, because that\u2019s where people spend more and more time (maybe too much, in my opinion). In this scenario, wisely keeping a blog means weighing the contribution it can offer, in a mix of different content formats. The specific value of a blog can be derived from the opportunity of owning an online identity under one\u2019s complete control. Of course you can get thousands of easy clicks on Facebook, but relying on social web only, means investing a lot in advertising and becoming a \u201cdigital sharecropper\u201d working for a more powerful absentee landlord. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe just nostalgic, but I know one thing for sure. I don't like it.\r\rS. More than once, you wrote that you consider blogs as hubs of good content marketing strategies. Do you think that blogs will still be relevant in the years to come, when referred to the context of an evolving social web?\r\rL. There are powers, such as Blockchain, whose aim is to avoid that the web will converge into too few hands. This challenge is apparently much like tilting at windmills when we consider the power that Facebook has today, but only time can tell. Not everyone happy being confined into a Facebook page, and this is the reason why I think bloggers still have more aces in their sleeves.\r\rS. In your recent article, you wrote that semantic web is preparing itself to start a revolution in the world of content. How do you figure out this revolution will look like?\r\rL. Digital assistants are the weapon that can contribute into the breaking Facebook's monopoly. In this field, Facebook is just a follower and the game is pretty hard. Google Home and Amazon Echo are moving their first steps into American houses and, once integrated into a family context, they will change forever the way we keep ourselves informed. Semantic web is the chance blogs were waiting in order to make a great comeback straight into the heart of a new context of free and open information, thanks to standards such as schema.org. The best is yet to come.\r\rS. You've started to use WordLift on your blog: what are your first impressions as a seasoned blogger?\r\rL. It's a very useful product. Maybe it needs some refinements before it becomes a tool used by the masses, but it has all the potential to contribute to the structured content revolution in blogging and more.\r\rTalking with Luca is always inspiring, and you can get even more inspiration from his books: check out his Content Marketing guide, written with Cristiano Carriero and published by Hoepli.",

        "text": "The Yoga of Revolution: Meditation and Semantic Web United A journey into the world of Yoga and meditation, how they bring us back to basics and how to apply them to the world of digital content writing.Back To The FutureThe year is 2030.\u201cHey! Did you try it as a kid?\u201d \u201cYes, I must admit! I tried it once but I inhaled without using the diaphragm! So I guess it doesn\u2019t count!\u201dOne could think that it is just a normal conversation between grown-ups discussing cannabis, but in fact it is about meditation and yoga and how we figure out it will be something so common and evolving that we will refer to it as an experience rather than an activity.\u201cYoga and laughing have helped defeating the frequent stress that worried past generations\u201d, slogan will read.What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you think about Yoga?Probably good posture, relaxation and mental order.In a certain way, Yoga and meditation are also about ordering thoughts and perceptions, focusing on what matters and melting away all the unuseful stuff we have to deal with everyday and which often causes anxieties. It's like going back to basics, holding on to our essence of human beings.So what should be a good architecture for a website or a blog about Yoga to express this mindset? This gain of awareness and order that follows a session of Yoga should also be reproduced in a website whose main focus is to talk about the practice and deliver it to newbies. For example, in the blog section of the website Yoga della Risata, posts and events are only listed in chronological order, as blogs used to do in the past; it can definetely produce a lot of stress when trying to decode the content instead of being the other way round. :)Laugh Your Head OffWe don\u2019t laugh enough and self-irony is not fashionable nowadays, maybe we take ourselves too seriously and there is this recurring feeling that laughing won\u2019t let us focus on our objectives in life.When we think about it, a spontaneous laughter may mostly occur when something unexpected happens: like a friend stumbling on the street or someone makes a joke. This is even more true when you realize that it is practically impossible to laugh without an event provoking the&nbsp;laughter.Most people are unaware that laughing is also a meditation technique: laughter meditation is a proper way to feel better and positive and like other techniques it is proven to boost the immune system, lower stress and aid digestion. Try for yourself, all you have to do is just laugh on an empty stomach!Order And MeditationAs proven above, meditation has faceted meanings, they go from think about it to forget it to just laugh yourself out. Considering the extensive production of books, courses, events and websites on the matter we must assume that meditation does work: it frees our minds from useless attentions and makes us happier.Everyone is unique and uniquely follows its path, the number of meditations is at least the same as the number of individuals ever appeared on our planet. This means they are supposed to grow.Moreover if we take for granted that nothing and no one exist autonomously and independently, as the following article implies (link in Italian) there must be something that connects all diversity, dots that connect all the paths. The article is taken from&nbsp;Meditare.net&nbsp;a website that promotes and introduces books about the mind and meditation to users, but not only that.In the summary of&nbsp;the twin website Meditare.it,&nbsp;&nbsp;we can scroll a classification of content in alphabetical order: each section of content has plenty of internal posts that resemble a simple digital encyclopedia of meditation.To be so this content should be organized and delivered to users. It would be great if every site could provide its users with an internal encyclopedia of concepts organized in such a way that nothing goes unread or is unclear to the reader.Truth is that when users visit websites the principle of serendipity often applies: you\u2019re looking for something but there comes a link to some other article that makes you curious, this casual intuition is also celebrated in this blogpost (link in Italian). Surely, a lot of good things in life are unexpected and unpredictable but a website really shouldn\u2019t be!This confusion is generated by a lack of standardization of semantic languages, which has been proposed by schema.org &nbsp;and DBpedia. The semantic web gives us the immense opportunity to adopt a language in form of metadata, that can be readable both by humans and machines. That is order! Imagine to have the opportunity to associate each type of yoga practice to a certain style and position and make it understandable and searchable by everyone, be it person or computer.The image is taken from the website CoseperCrescere.itStart The Revolution!When using structured content it is easier to find what you\u2019re looking for, as content is organized and linked to other relevant and related content.TaoRoma is the blog of an association whose goal is to promote and introduce martial and taoist arts into our hectic daily life.Using WordLift they have structured the content of their blog, just so that it does what they created it for: showing organized content that would be relevant to readers. While creating and taking care of entities they have built&nbsp;their own encyclopedia. And it works just great!When creating entities for anatomical parts of the body WordLift has attached and connected to every entity the data provided by  DBpedia. In our case, every entity was marked with an rdf:type Anatomical Structure (here you can find DBpedia's ontology). This classification can be used in many ways, as it gives the possibility to create personalized menus on the website, implementing a bot etc.Below is the query SPARQL that makes TaoRoma's blog easier to browse and the list of results of the related entities: a lot of different ways to find and read content. In fact, with this query we can easily find all the entities that are marked as&nbsp;Anatomical Structure on the blog. The content is structured with metadata that WordLift learned from open encyclopedias, like DBpedia, in our case.SELECT ?s WHERE { ?s a &lt;http://dbpedia.org/ontology/AnatomicalStructure&gt; }Here we are asking&nbsp;(with the help of DBpedia) give me all the&nbsp;\"things\" that are Anatomical Structure on the websiteIf we want to face the changes that the web is going through, we have to start using a technical language that can be automatically attached to content; a language of metadata in which there are no terms that can\u2019t be read both from humans and machines. A language composed of concrete words, univocally recognizable.When publishing content on your  Wordpress&nbsp;website you will automatically communicate to machines and humans that the triangle position is a basic position, which style it is and its origins and if it can be part of yoga therapy.We can face the confusion on the web, we can change the implications of search engines and of users that follow their rules; we have to let go of abstract languages that bind our communication in a billion of tags and relations, but we must do it all laughing.&nbsp;? &nbsp;We can trace a new path without waiting for the internet to change, we can start the revolution using a software like WordLift.",

        "text": "The Language of Numbers or The Number of Languages? Numbers date back to the dawn of the human species, the need for humans to associate a\u00a0quantity to a symbol has allowed us and our thinking to grow exponentially (literally!).\u00a0\r\rEach one of us has a favourite number. I\u00a0confess having changed mine several times. Some of us have a more prominent ability in dealing with numbers and languages, while others are fonder of the \u201carts\u201d intended as drawing, painting, and creating music. These characteristics change also the way we act and reason in our everyday-life. The assumptions above come from the studies that world famous Nobel laureate, Roger Sperry was conducting on the \u201csplit brain\u201d and accidentally came to discover that only the left side of the brain can articulate speech but the right part is also capable of a special kind of language, a different one, later described as \u201ccreative\u201d. Since then researchers, doctors and psychologists started elaborating theories and studies about the lateralization of the brain functions. \u00a0\u00a0\r\rHowever, science is unclear if the language of numbers is\u00a0heritage of the left part of the brain, or if it is equally distributed: odds on the left, evens on the right, zero in the middle.\r\rZero can play any number, or infinite combinations of numbers, just like the tarot card of The Fool: \u00a0the unruly wanderer who has knowledge but doesn\u2019t use it during his journey. The Fool starts a trip through the mysteries of life but without any clear destination or map. He\u2019s free from the set of schemes we have been taught to build for ourselves. Moreover, its card number is\u2026 well, zero of course!\rThe \"truth\" between the\u00a0two cerebral hemispheres\rStill, it is absurd to imagine sharp divisions between right and left hemispheres. Tlon is a project whose attempt is to unify those hemispheres.\u00a0Its staff is mainly made up of young people who want to tidy up the Italian cultural landscape integrating academical studies with the holistic, what is concrete with what is unknown; and they have fun organizing events like the University of Philosophy and Imagination.\u00a0Despite the uncertain source of our ability in \u201cdoing the math\u201d, the importance of numbers is undeniable as well as their capacity to express our behaviours and opinions.\rThe \"poetical\"\u00a0value\u00a0of Big Data\u00a0\rDear Data - A digital-to-analog project\r\rAs absurd as it may seem, statistics and economics have been expressing people\u2019s most hidden sides and thoughts with numbers: from political polls to microeconomics\u2019 theories of how people take decisions. \r\rJournalists and professional bloggers have a growing necessity of using real data to improve the strength of their positions because we all know that numbers never lie and comparing numbers we can understand the real social value of our choices.\u00a0Real data is available as open data and is published on the web for everyone to elaborate it.\r\rThe website \u00a0www.truenumbers.it is already stepping towards a futuristic form of journalism, a way of telling facts and stories that is data-driven and reliable.\u00a0The site reports with real numbers the results of our behaviors, both as individuals and as parts of a collectiveness, and it does so providing graphs and tables along with tools to interpret them. \r\rGraphs and tables date back to the 18th and 19th centuries when scientists and mathematicians found it too difficult to express some important physical problems with elementary functions so they started drawing the data they had elaborated in form of curves and formulas, just the same way our ancestors started drawing quantities that later became the numbers as we know them, using the creative hemisphere of the brain to express what the most analytical side had elaborated.\r\rThe blog www.frizzifrizzi.it\u00a0tells us to check out Dear Data\u00a0a\u00a0graphic book by two designers (Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec) that explains the art of expressing facts through data: for one year they have been sending each other postcards from one side of the ocean to another, only \u201cspeaking\u201d through freshly invented, and hand-drawn graphic systems. The graphs told the most human and common stories and feelings such as: laughs, decisions taken and goodbyes. The project was a major success and is now a book.\r\rAs we write this blog post WordLift is analyzing each word and extracting relevant concepts to create a visible-to-machine data structure that search engines will use to help me connect with you - the reader of these words. \r\rWordLift, for each relevant concept, creates an annotation counting each character I write.

        "text": "JSON-LD - How to use Linked Data for a better User Experience In 1989 Tim Berners-Lee published a memo in which he described the former structure of the World Wide Web. The basic idea of this project was to make people able to jump from one document to another whenever someone referred to it in his work. What Tim was aiming at was a system that could help scientists to save the time spent in searching for references and referred papers.\r\rIn 2009 the very same guy was invited to attend a TED conference where he suggested the idea of an Internet built on Linked Data (from now on LD). \r\rLD is great for computers and, if presented in the right way, also for humans. LD is basically a set of relationships between data: think about Facebook where every click we make creates a relation between us and something else, like a new friend, a movie, a photo etc. All these relationships generate a huge and detailed network, populated by meaningful links. All these data is accessible and readable by computers thanks to the data-structure that they can get access to. \r\rWordLift uses a format called JSON-LD to allow your data to be readable for machines and converted, analyzed or displayed in third party websites and applications. \r\r\r\rLD helps creating accessible content outside a website. Near our office in Rome there is a tailor's shop called Sartoria Scavelli, they sell bespoke suits and realize high couture tailoring products using the finest fabrics on the market and delivering an impeccable service. \r\rSartoria Scavelli runs a simple but well organized website, they use WordLift to write blog posts about fine fabrics, seasonal trends and the history of iconic garments (like ties or polo shirts). \r\rSartoria Scavelli has created an entity on WordLift for the shop and has linked every relevant information to it, so that when someone searches for Sartoria Scavelli on Google Search, a Google Card (Knowledge Graph) appears with every useful information the user needs to locate the shop and know everything about its services and the fabrics used; this happens both because of the information added with WordLift both because the website is powered by Google My Business.\r\rHow could the tailor's shop use the same technique to help his readers have a better experience on their website? They could grab the data created using WordLift and create custom widgets. This is the very same technique used by Google when displaying cards on the side of the search.\r\rIn the first days of the Internet there where fewer display options, imagine that custom colours were not even supported, yet. Users had to stick to plain text pages and almost no layout at all. The experience they where facing was almost unfriendly as reading plain code. Thirty years after we can see how much interfaces have changed. The experience offered to users is immersive and tailored for their habits and devices.\r\rNowadays deliver a tailored user experience to every one, is barely impossible: screen sizes and supported technologies are a Pandora's box that every front-end engineer have to face. On the other side delivering raw data and letting the device handle the visualization is way more simple than before.\r\rWith JSON-LD you can create data visualization tailored to the UX experience you chose for your website, like a suit made by Sartoria Scavelli to fit your shape perfectly. Just take a look for now, we'll be back soon with another post to tell you how.\r\rBelow is the JSON-LD created by WordLift to represent how Linked Data was used to annotate this blogpost.

        "text": "WordLift: a THING that MAKES us SMART The title of this post is taken from Donald Norman's book \"Things that Make Us Smart.\"\rDonald Norman is a guru for all designers since his definition of human\u00a0centered design, which explained\u00a0how design can make people happier. Here is the link to one of his short presentations from TED in 2003.\r\rNorman is also known to the public for books and manuals such as \u201cThe Design of Everyday Things,\u201d which was perfectly summarized by a funny occurrence in Rome in a bus of the city transportation system.\rTalking about \"Things that make us smart\", Norman classifies humans in 3 categories:\r\r&nbsp;\r\r \tThose who build artifacts;\r \tThose who use them;\r \tThose who observe: the sky surrounding the earth, the events, human behaviours etc.\r\rIt\u2019s a flow that has shaped the funnel of human evolution:\u00a0BUILD\u00a0- USE - OBSERVE and vice-versa; these three attitudes follow each other in a recurrent, never ending process: for example, from the observation of how something is made or used, new ideas/products arise.\rWordLift allows you to reproduce the virtuous funnel BUILD\u00a0- USE - OBSERVE when creating content for your website. WordLift is a semantic web organizer, a new product for all bloggers that publish content on the web through the CMS WordPress. The software semi-automatically associates a group of metadata that translates all kind of content into a language read by machines, with the aim to increase the visibility of the information given to users and to make it easier to find it. WordLift allows you to BUILD\u00a0the metadata of your content, USE them to increase its value, and OBSERVE the results to find new angles and new directions for your website and editorial plan.\rWordLift is the result of over 10 years of \u201cresearch and development\u201d, applied to two EU funded research projects (IKS and MICO) by a team that since 1998 has:\r\r \tBUILT\u00a0platforms and web systems for users;\r \tUSED\u00a0the web to satisfy curiosity and professional demands;\r \tOBSERVED\u00a0technology and the evolution of the web since its birth.\r\rWordLift is a technology that allows you to classify information: a knowledge organizer. The design approach that has informed its production stages is a derivative of Ergonomics, the discipline that studies the interaction between a system and its users.\rWordLift classifies information to build and run dataset open (compatible with the LoD cloud), just the same way genes that make up the DNA give instructions to build and run our organism.\r\rClassifications help us finding the things we are looking for. Classification systems are useful to organize knowledge as well.\u00a0Shiyali Ramamrita Ranganathan, an Indian mathematician, introduced the fundamental categories of classification back in the first half of \u2018900, identifying the ones valid for all disciplines:\r\r \tSpace and time, on which everyone agrees;\r \tEnergy, referring to activity or dynamism which in the field of semantics is the \u201cagent that takes an action\u201d;\r \tMatter, typical of a material or its properties;\r \tPersonas to point out the main object of the context even in the cases when no human beings are involved.\r\rThey are almost identical, to the 5 Ws used in marketing or the 4Ws typical of content organization categories: Who, Where, When, What. These categories have been considered abstract until the emergence of new sciences such as Neurobiology, that introduced the models and patterns used by our brain to build up our memories and everything else we keep in our minds.\rOnce installed, WordLift connects directly to Schema.org, a vocabulary of concepts, widely used all over the web and made up of more than 1200 items collected in 9 essential categories: Action, Creative Work, Event, Intangible, Medical Entity, Organization, Person, Place, Product.\rThose categories are grouped by the plugin to the 4Ws as followed:\r\r \tWho \u2013 Person, Organization, Local Business\r \tWhere \u2013 Place\r \tWhen \u2013 Event\r \tWhat \u2013 Creative Work, Thing\r\rA component of the software reads the content and automatically extracts concepts (Person, Organization, Local Business, Place, Event, Creative Work, Thing) attributable to the 4W from the text. The user has the option to add more concepts to those suggested by the application and to create its own internal vocabulary building his/her own sector's wikipedia.\rTo check out how the plugin works you can watch\u00a0the tutorial videos.\r\rIf all content on the web was published with this kind of technology, even the most unobtainable and beautiful objects would be part of one catalogue (or dataset), therefore findable, like a universal version or the \"Catalogue of Unobtainable Objects\" by Jacques Carelman, mentioned in the magazine Cosebelle.\rThe editors of Cosebelle magazine using WordLift would have the possibility to build their own vocabulary and open dataset across all the things and themes they deal with.\rA dataset of beautiful things, of course, accessible, visible and understandable both by users and machines without stressing too much with search optimisation tasks.\r\rIncreasing both ranking and visibility of online content, while retaining the ownership of the data produced, is by no means a secondary goals for any web content creator: these are the goals pursued during all the stages of WordLift construction.\rIf you have been following Annamaria Testa\u2019s blog from the very beginning, you already know it all about the theories and best practices of everyday-creativity.\r\rOver time the blog has constantly increased its audience. Surely by virtue of the quality of its content which, if I had to define in just one word, I would say: exhaustive. It takes quality and experience to satisfy expectations year after year. It takes good writing, great titles, depth of content. Everything in the right place. If their posts were also published with the semantic web organizer WordLift, their vast content would be organized as in a digital library: becoming more accessible, and further increasing its value.\rWordLift is one thing that makes us smart!\r",

        "text": "In the shadow of Anulu It\u2019s been a surreal August 2016; assuming surreality exists. It\u2019s been decades since the disclosure of techniques about imagination: customs and traditions of the mind to shape our personal worlds and build positive events for ourselves. But given the success among people of visual by-products, we can state that there is no difference between reality and surreality. A notorious thinker, associating true/false (maybe Nietzsche) once said: truth doesn\u2019t exist, reality is perception. And the creative ones, of point of views, don\u2019t they appear surreal at the eyes of others when they are shared? Acceptable visions, as most people call them, but it\u2019s not what I see!\r\rA month ago, July 2016, there was a little group of children near the place where I\u2019m writing from, and the grown-ups, parents or not, getting close to each other (I\u2019m not sure why) were asking themselves: what will they write in their back-to-school essay assignment titled \u201cwhat did you do during the holidays?\u201d. They were feeling that the situation was getting out of hand and becoming irrational already, just a few days into their summer break. \r\rFinally a summer of un-named stars, of clouds passing by that don\u2019t resemble anything, of tired weather forecasts, of stories, encounters and clashes handled with the energy of a sloth. As always, there were daily ritual confrontations though: both verbal and physical. \r\rWe are at the beach, it used to be more isolated before. It gathers random people, locals and foreigners. A cabin is the collection point; built to be good, homey.\u00a0Its shadow offers some relief to its guests. Near and around more modern shelters and a trivial space dedicated to fire, during a month, August, always above 30\u00b0, including at night.\r\rBesides the \u201cpassers-by\u201d, at the cabin there are a few usuals: sorcio, rana, and paperello.\u00a0The usuals sweep, embellish, order and scrutinize, far and close; once everything is calm, they entertain themselves and the passers-by.\r\rPaperello, right on August 1st, from a palm trunk brought there by the sea, created AN\u00d9LU, baptizing the first pagan totem in the area. He built a pedestal and a core to erect it, and positioned it looking east, between the cabin and the sea. Immediately the environment turned into a space, the beginning of a human recognizable order, an explosive un-directional zone typical of the first post-caveman\u2019s villages. Flies arrived soon-after, for duty to report. Meanwhile, someone started talking about the \u201cGod ANULU\u201d. Exaggerating: there is always a cult and someone who overreacts. But it is a known fact that the shoreline is also a path for pilgrimages: from morning to evening, young and old, back and forth.\u00a0People started noticing and stopping by. Coming back the following day with their smartphones for the unmissable selfie, laughing unaware.\r\rAt the end of August someone dared to say that 3000 selfies had been taken, with the help from MANITA, another pagan totem, newer, embossed on another piece of palm trunk with the help of Rana. Without pedestal this time, it is self-standing. About the relationship between the totems, rumor has MANITA as the daughter of ANULU.\r\rThe cabin upstream, the sea in front, the father totem in the right half, the daughter totem closer to the sea in the left half, they marked together the free path, street or square toward fresh reliefs. This is where everything happened.\r\rIn a context like this, different manifestations of the matter can appearo: hot, competitive, airy, spiritual, almost esoteric; but always real. Many of them look like they just stepped out of the Peanuts, including the dazed observing dog; or read in Alan Ford, a comic about secret agents that became famous with number 26, when the alcoholic menace \u201cSuperciuk\u201d showed up; or out of Castaneda\u2019s books, where evening and nocturnal discussions were anticipated by him saying that there are not two separate worlds, two different realities, a normal world and a paranormal world\u2026 but only one world, that you can \u201clook at\u201d or \u201csee\u201d; or out of Tex Willer, wise navajos leader, eagle of the night - a legend; or resembling other comic characters, like Poldo Sbaffini (Popeye), trickster, flatterer, eternally hungry and hamburger craver; or Bongo the gorilla (from the Italian comic Nonna Abelarda), which communicated with sentences written on banners instead of the classic cloud. Fumettologica.it\u2019s blog posted at the end of August the latest cover of Zagor-te-nai, the spirit with the Hatchet. Rana dared to feel and describe himself as Zagor, and dared also to say it out loud. There were a few Indians here and there; maybe that\u2019s what confused him. In a few words, normal people from real life, characters of a bigger story.\u00a0\r\rIt was like reading a book titled \u201cThe cabin on the sea\u201d, something like Il bar sotto il mare, by Stefano Benni, \u201cwhere everything can happen...where all of us want to be\u201d.\r\rYou might not believe me, I know. We spend half of our life laughing at other people\u2019s beliefs and the other half believing in what other people laugh at. I often read the blog Scratchbook.net, where Maria De Biase tells us of books, authors and characters playing between truth and fiction. In one of her latest post, she introduced Nausea by J.P. Sartre, and the difference between what\u2019s internal and what\u2019s external in a context made of an absurd life. While I was reading the post, father ANULU and daughter MANITA were still there: enclosing, observing and protecting their space and whoever came to do daily ablutions. Passers-by were increasingly intrigued by the religious paganism of the situation.\r\rToday is the last day of August 2016; at the cabin there is only a woman wearing a mask, who dove to look for heart-shaped stones. She gathers and collects them. Will she classify them? Will there be an order understood by both machines and people to collect heart-shaped stones?\r\rA Japanese writer, Marie Kondo, known for her book \u201cThe Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing,\u201d suggests a method to organize our life organizing our surroundings. Following a similar approach, if you write a blog and you want to share your passions, you should re-organize your blog into an open dataset, adding a classification system to your personal diary, enhancing the value of your thoughts, your attentions and the objects you care about. For example, if you write a deep study in your blog about the world of comic books, those should be classified and organized in open datasets and presented to the web and to readers according to how machines, search engines and our personal memory work, making it easier for our comic books to be found and read. \r\rIf your blog is on Wordpress, you can download the plug-in WordLift and it will take care of this task for you. WordLift is a web organizer for professional online publishers, that automatically makes your diary (blog), and all the emotions, interests, pictures, memories, hobbies, advices it contains, as well as your life, accessible to machines, search engines and people.\r\rWordLift is the best solution to rearrange our digital expressions, to make them readable and sharable, associating them to similar content. To do so it follows the same schemes our mind uses to build our memories and classify our knowledge and the same classification models used by common knowledge platforms such as Google and Wikipedia. It could classify and further enhance our comic\u2019s characters and superheros, attaching to them a layer of metadata answering the following questions: where? \u2026 \u00a0when? \u2026 \u00a0who? \u2026 what is it? ... what is it connected to? ... what deepens it? ... building the quintessential network of comics any comic book publisher dreams about.\r\rP.S.: the nickname Sorcio, Rana e Paperello (and several of the non-quoted passers-by) are taken from the series pupazzocriminale.it.",

        "text": "11 Best SEO Tools for Content Writing Some principles never change \u2013 even in the ever-changing digital marketing world \u2013 like the evergreen \u201ccontent is king.\u201d In 2023, one of the most effective marketing strategies is still the creation of digital content for our audience, even though our ability and the technology to do so have significantly evolved. In this context, content automation is now king.Companies and individual marketers alike are using more and more digital platforms and SEO tools for content writing. AI is now able to support us in better ways to produce content (also publishing and distributing it), and the market is offering more and better ways to satisfy our needs. Most likely, you have already been using these very tools.We believe that SEO automation will be huge. Content creation will increasingly be a task performed by humans and AI working in tandem.This is happening due to technological advances, of course, but also to a highly competitive market. The Internet is now a boundless ocean of competing content. To get the attention of our target, we must compete in quality, uniqueness and authority with a fierce crowd of competitors.This article will define content automation, discuss how AI can help in generating content in a timely fashion, argue the reasons why we should use it, and provide a list of  SEO tools and platforms for content writing.This blog post is also available as Web Story &nbsp;\ud83d\udc49  Best SEO Tools for Content Writing Web StoryWhat is content automation? The ways in which AI generates effective content in a time-efficient mannerThy we should automate SEO content writingSEO tools for content writingMarketMuseTopicWordLiftParaphrasingtool.aiHIX.AIQuillBotFraseSemantikaClearscopeNeuralTextWriterWhat is content automation?Content Automation is the use of technologies, systems, and strategies that eliminate or significantly reduce human intervention at every step of the content creation process.Its main goal is to be of assistance to professionals and companies by delegating the most repetitive and tedious work to AI. It revolves around the same principles and needs of industrial automation, although applied to digital marketing and, more specifically, to the sub-sector of content marketing.The ways in which AI generates effective content in a time-efficient manner.AI helps us at every step of the way in content creation, especially in the most time consuming and repetitive tasks.Thanks to machine learning, a few platforms are able to analyze the structure of articles better suited to our needs through specific keyword usage and then generate detailed reports on them in a few seconds.Moreover, advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) allow algorithms to better understand our inputs and then select content with pertinent information and with language closest to natural human expression.With these improvements, we can summarize even very long excerpts. Just think how convenient this could be in creating meta-descriptions of our articles or texts accompanying social media dissemination.Some of the methods used in NLP to process content. This image was suggested by WordLift AI.We can ask AI to look for the most suit\u0430ble images to accompany our text.We can even ask AI to create a whole text following our input, like in this famous example from The Guardian or to answer specific questions, like the ones Andrea Volpini, our CEO, asked to the davinci model on GPT-3 in an article on SEO trends in 2021.Just imagine how much faster these tools can generate your content.Why we should automate SEO content writingThe first reason is extremely simple: it\u2019s time-saving and, consequently, cost-effective.Just imagine you\u2019re writing an important piece for your target. How long would it take to identify the best topic, find your keywords, research your sources, and analyze your competitors? How long would it take to manually apply the markup of structured data on your article in order for Google to fully understand your content and disseminate it as widely as possible?Have you completed your estimate? Excellent. Can I give you some good news?There are already a number of solutions in place that can do all this in a few clicks.You can even estimate the time you\u2019ll save by automating one or more of these tasks and multiply it by the number of contents you generate in a year. You will then have a realistic estimate of how much AI can contribute in cutting marketing costs.Another reason to automate content is cutting down on human error. Just think of the time spent in looking for typos. An algorithm is never tired at 5pm on a Friday \u2013 but we are. When properly programmed, your tool will always find typos. As trained as our eyes can be, we will always make mistakes because of exhaustion, distraction, or simply \u2026 being human \ud83d\ude42. AI will always be more efficient than we could ever be in tasks like these and it would be wise to delegate them to AI.Lastly, because it can process an enormous amount of data, AI can improve the quality of your content.And just to calm those nagging fears, let me say one last thing about this: AI will never \u201csteal\u201d your job (maybe just a few monotonous tasks). Rather, it will allow you to do better work and to devote yourself to the tasks where you can really make a difference.We\u2019ve been suspicious of AI for more than two centuries, but machines do not take away our jobs. Jobs change and evolve because of technological advances. Whether we like it or not, this is also the future of content marketing.AI Text Generation for SEO: learn how to train your model on a generic data-to-text generation task&nbsp;SEO tools for content writingNow that we know what content automation is, and how it can help us in digital marketing, let\u2019s have a look at a few of the solutions available.

        "text": "Touch your SEO: Introducing Physical SEO Executive summaryThis post is part of a series that dives deep into the power of data for e-commerce. You can find the other posts here:The Power of Product Knowledge Graph for E-commerceTouch your SEO: Introducing Physical SEOThe GS1 Digital Link explained for SEO Jedis (and their clients)The Only Thing Missing in Your Omnichannel E-commerce Strategy is\u2026In the previous post of the Product Knowledge Graphs series we introduced you to the possibilities a Product Knowledge Graph opens for e-commerce data. In this post, we want to show you something equally exciting: Physical SEO. That is the intersection of physical and digital UX environments and the instrumental role of linked data and SEO for your products' visibility and sales.&nbsp;IntroAs the boundaries between physical and cyber spaces are blurring, e-commerce and the digital marketing behind it have to catch up with ever-changing consumer needs and behaviours. Take for example an in-store experience. More often than not people would scan a product to find its ingredients, or search for product reviews, feedback, discounts.&nbsp;&nbsp;All in one, we act digital in the physical world. In such a scenario, the question for digital marketing and e-commerce is: \u201cHow to connect a physical product to the ecosystem of data on the Web?\u201dAnd the answer is structured data - the common thread running through three things we want to connect the dots for here:&nbsp;Physical SEO&nbsp;Barcodes as entry points to digital experiences (GS1 Digital Link technology)Product Knowledge Graph.1. Physical SEO, yes you heard that right.2. Making Barcodes Speak Linked Data (GS1 Digital Link)3. The Product Knowledge Graph: Seeing Connected Data As a Marketing Tool4. A Bag of Chips Instead of an EpiloguePhysical SEO, yes you heard that right.&nbsp;\u201cIn the next step, the Semantic Web will break out of the virtual realm and extend into our physical world. URIs can point to anything, including physical entities, which means we can use the RDF language to describe devices such as cell phones and TVs.\u201dCitation: Scientific American article by TBL (Solid), Ora Lassila (now Amazon), Hedler (Working Ontologist 2020), available here.The term \u201cphysical SEO\u201d is vague but exciting. We use it to define the activities related to search engine optimization that triggers digital experiences in physical environments and vice versa.&nbsp;Think of it. For example, if you are a manufacturer, you have to not only put your product on the shelf in the store, but also on the shelf for anyone browsing the Web for information. If you want to save time and money, you need a unique identifier for this product that will allow all your stakeholders fast and easy access to the data about it (price, description, availability, to mention just a few).In other words, as search is inevitably permeating physical environments, so should SEO activities.Fortunately, together with the increasingly complex digital user behavior come the increasingly connected and mature technologies to live up to the empowered users' expectations.Enter GS1 Digital Link.Making Barcodes Speak Linked Data (GS1 Digital Link)GS1 Digital link is developed by GS1, a not-for-profit global supply chain standards organization working to improve the efficiency, safety and visibility of supply chains. GS1 is best known for the barcode - the single standard for product identification. As GS1 standards aim to provide a framework that allows products, services, and information about them to move efficiently and securely across physical and digital channels, the organization started developing a standard that would \u201cextend the power and flexibility of GS1 identifiers by making them part of the web.\u201d &nbsp; &nbsp;Today, the standard is ready to facilitate the exchange and comparison of structured data and bridge the gap between usually incomplete data behind a scanned barcode. GS1 Digital Link promises to enhance the shopping experience for consumers by simplifying B2B data sharing and providing a standards-based unified way of describing products..Why would a user want to access a Product Knowledge Graph from a barcode?&nbsp; He might want to:Learn more about the productCompare the product to other productsSearch for offersBrowse reviewsCheck compatibilityFind technical specificationsVery simply put, the GS1 Digital Link works based on providing a simple, standards-based structure for the data about a product. With GS1 Digital Link, information such as expiration dates, nutritional and medical product data, warranty registration, troubleshooting instructions, even social media links are becoming available with a single scan.Image source: GS1 Digital Link FlyerThe GS1 Digital Link work is a treasure trove for anyone interested in publishing clean, structured and meaningful data on the Web. And this is where a Product Knowledge Graph can immensely enrich the exchange by providing an ecosystem of related information about any product in the blink of a scan.&nbsp;The Product Knowledge Graph: Seeing Connected Data As a Marketing ToolAs the underlying ecology of e-commerce is changing, the ways you publish product data to serve your customers and other stakeholders best require new approaches.As the amazing Aaron Bradley wrote about that 5 (yes!, five) years ago in his blog SEO with Data :\u201cif data about you is going to appear in the search results \u2013 and it is \u2013 make sure it\u2019s accurate by providing it yourself.\u201dAnd this is exactly what WordLift aims to do, enabling a scenario where all interested parties (merchants, retailers, customers) have access to interconnected detailed information about anything across both physical and digital channels. In other words, all kinds of data derived from (and accessed from) one comprehensive Product Knowledge Graph.To understand the value of a Product Knowledge Graph for e-commerce, let\u2019s have a look at a model. In 2018 researchers Turban, Outland et al. created the following model (in their book Electronic Commerce 2018 A Managerial and Social Networks Perspective):Source: Slides for Chapter 2&nbsp;Now, let\u2019s take it from this model and enhance it with the understanding and practice of Linked Data and e-commerce. The model will be pretty much the same, however the data that will feed a portal is data that you have control over.Person- &gt; 2. Portal - &gt; 3. Product Knowledge Graph&nbsp;A Bag of Chips Instead of an EpilogueSir Tim-Berners Lee constantly leaves us notes to the future. This is what he did in 2010. With a bag of chips.&nbsp;In this talk, the Web's inventor talks about the barcode as a universal way for retailers to \u201ctalk\u201d about products and the various other languages packages use to convey information.A decade later all these components can be integrated and put in a Product Knowledge Graph, benefiting both consumers and producers. As we saw GS1 Digital Link opens the possibilities for such integration. WordLift pushes the idea one step forward by helping producers, retailers and e-commerce businesses publish their data to allow any search engine or platform to consume it in a meaningful way for the user.Do you want your customers to find you on the digital shelf?

        "text": "Understanding Basic Google Analytics Terms for Beginners Ever since it was introduced back in 2005, Google Analytics has slowly but steadily transformed into the go-to analytics software for digital marketers. Google Analytics is currently the most popular website tracking software with almost a 40% market share.&nbsp;What makes it so popular, besides the obvious fact that it\u2019s a Google product, is the fact that it\u2019s free, easy to use, is easily integrated with other tools, and it also offers the most complete features compared to other free analytics software.&nbsp;With that being said, 60% of marketers still haven\u2019t used Google Analytics to track their website performance. If you\u2019re one of them, I strongly recommend you to try using it because it\u2019s free, which means that you\u2019ve got nothing to lose. But, before you do that, you should understand these basic terms of Google Analytics first.&nbsp;&nbsp;The MetricsUsers / VisitorsUsers or visitors are people that visit a page or multiple pages on your website. GA relies on your website\u2019s cookies to identify incoming visitors. Users that come to your site for the first time will be identified as new users, while users with existing cookies will be identified as returning users. However, keep in mind that if a returning user clears his/her cookies or uses a different browser, then that person will be identified as a new user again.Sessions / VisitsSessions are a set of activities that a user does on your website during a specific time frame. For Google Analytics, the specific time frame is set by default at 30 minutes. So, if a user browses on your site for 15 minutes, leaves, and then comes back within 30 minutes, it will be recorded as one session. But, if a user browses, becomes inactive for over 30 minutes, and then comes back online, it will be recorded as two sessions.[wl_navigator title=\"Related articles\" limit=\"4\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" offset=\"0\" uniqid=\"\" order_by=\"ID DESC\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/navigator.png\" post_types=\"\" ]Average Session DurationThe average session duration is the average time users spent on your website within a specific time frame. GA measures it by dividing the total time spent with the total amount of sessions. For instance, in 30 days, your website receives a total of 500 sessions with the total time spent 1,500 minutes (90,000 seconds). It means that your average session duration for that particular month is 3 minutes (180 seconds).&nbsp;ggghPageviewsPageviews refer to the number of times a user visits a particular page on your website. If someone visits your homepage, refreshes the page 5 times, and then goes to the sales page, it\u2019ll be counted as 6 views for the homepage and 1 view for the sales page.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bounce RateThe bounce rate is the number of users who visit a page on your website and then leave without browsing any further. A high bounce rate is an indication that you need to upgrade the content of your site.&nbsp;TrafficSource / MediumThe source is the last place a user visited before going to your website. In other words, the source is the origin of your website traffic. A source could be directly from a search engine (Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc.), other websites, and social networks. While the medium is the category of each traffic source. A medium could be organic traffic, referral traffic, or CPC (paid traffic).&nbsp;Direct TrafficDirect traffic is used when Google Analytics can\u2019t identify the exact origin of the incoming traffic. Most of the time, direct traffic consists of people who type in your site\u2019s URL directly on their browser or click on a link on email apps.&nbsp;&nbsp;Organic TrafficOrganic traffic refers to the incoming visitors who found your site via organic links that appear on the search engine results page (SERP). The amount of organic traffic that you get is an indicator of how well your website is optimized for search engines.&nbsp;Paid TrafficSimilar to organic traffic, paid traffic also refers to visitors who found your website via the search engine. The difference is, instead of clicking on organic links, they click on one of your paid search engine advertisements.&nbsp;Referral TrafficReferral traffic refers to people that visit your site by clicking the links on third-party websites and social media platforms. This report enables you to find out which websites or even pages that\u2019s been sending you the most traffic.Goals &amp; ConversionsGoalGoals are used to track various users\u2019 activities on your site, like subscribing to your newsletter, downloading an ebook, watching a video, clicking on a link, or purchasing a product.&nbsp;Goal CompletionA goal completion is counted when a user completes a particular goal that you\u2019ve set before during a single session. No matter how many times the user completes the same goal during that session, it\u2019ll only be counted as a single completion.Conversion RateConversion rate is the percentage of your total website visitors who complete your desired goals. It\u2019s measured by dividing the total goal completion with the total number of visits during a particular time frame. For instance, if you receive 200 visitors in a month and five of them actually buy something, that means your conversion rate is 2.5%.&nbsp;ConclusionGoogle Analytics is one of the few website analytics software that has a friendly user interface, but don\u2019t be mistaken, mastering Google Analytics isn\u2019t an easy task. With so many terms and glossary, using GA for the first time can be quite confusing.&nbsp;That\u2019s why for people who want to start using GA, I recommend you to learn step by step. Understanding the basic terms of GA is an important first step before learning more advanced and complicated things.&nbsp;Author\u2019s BioAndre Oentoro is one of the co-founders of Milkwhale, an internationally acknowledged infographic production agency.

        "text": "Get Rich Snippets on Google\u2019s SERP with Schema.org Rich snippets and other features that you can obtain on Google's SERP using the schema markupWithin the past 10 years, the appearance and function of Google\u2019s SERP have drastically changed with the inclusion of several rich snippets and SERP features that provide additional functionalities for users and adds challenges for SEO experts.&nbsp;In fact, these rich snippets provide unique opportunities to increase CTRs as well as lower opportunities of appearing on the SERP with a simple blue link. This guide will introduce you to the various forms of rich snippets you can find on the SERP and then will focus on using structured data to optimize your content for rich snippets.Let's start with the basics...What are Rich Snippets and SERP&nbsp;Features and why they are important?When you search for Neil Armstrong on Google, you will receive different results both in the form of snippets and blue links. What distinguishes a rich snippet from a normal one is that a rich snippet is a specialized form of search result that is tailored for a particular task or function rather than a simple blue link. In this example, you can see a Knowledge Card about Neil Armstrong, a collection of movies about him, a group of people who are usually searched together with this astronaut, and a series of Top News which refer to this search.Other examples include: the movie schedule for a given cinema when searching for movies in your area. When searching for a chocolate cake, a photo, item description, nutritional information and recipes pop-up.What makes rich snippets important in SEO is that now, these snippets have become more important than the regular blue links.&nbsp;Rich snippets are more engaging as they can contain pictures, highlighted information and links more closely associated with the search terms. In addition, they are viewed as both more trustworthy and convenient as not only does the content stand out from the other search results, but it is far more likely to be much more closely associated with the official content such as an official website and social media.An Important Note on Structured DataMuch of these rich snippets require the development of structured data to fully utilize their benefits. Structured data is an on-page markup that adds additional information to your website and provides it to users seeking relevant information on the SERP. It utilizes HTML coding and Schema markup to communicate with the search engine regarding your content.&nbsp;Here is what Google states on its introductory guide to structured data:Google uses structured data that it finds on the web to understand the content of the page, as well as to gather information about the web and the world in general.In this article, you will find more specific information on how to optimize your content for each type of rich snippet using structured data.&nbsp;We at WordLift can help you develop structured content for your website, not only to be on the Google SERP, but to appear in the newer, much more engaging content found in rich snippets. We\u2019ll go through the types and uses of much of this data using the schema markup. If you\u2019re wanting more specific uses of structured data or how best to utilize it for your content, we\u2019re always happy to provide our services and assistance.Do you want to ensure that your schema markup aligns with the best practices of Google and Bing and validates against their guidelines? Do you want to know if the syntax is correct and validates against the schema.org vocabulary?

In this page, you will find out how to obtain visibility with: Featured snippetPAAFAQHow-ToAnswer Box ResultsExplore PanelKnowledge Graph CarouselSite LinksFeatured SnippetA featured snippet features a website in a specialized format, providing a relevant passage and an accompanying photo. Featured snippets on Google may lead to higher CTRs, due to their more highlighted presence and description.&nbsp;To increase the odds of being featured in a featured snippet, your website should include at least a brief description relevant to the topic. The more precise and vivid you are in your descriptions, the more likely it is that Google will understand your webpage. A more careful selection of keywords will also help Google\u2019s algorithm understand the website.Structured Data and Featured SnippetsStructured data may help, but it's not always needed to appear with a featured snippet. In this case the most relevant answer with a well-curated formatting is often enough.PAAPeople Also Ask (PAA) is a rich snippet that contains a selection of questions&nbsp;that are similar to those found in a Q&amp;A section of a website. Each question in the snippet can be opened to reveal its corresponding answer. As a question is selected, the revealed answer lists to a website and the snippet expands to add more questions related to the one answered.&nbsp;If you want the answers in the snippet to link back to your website, start by optimizing your content for each targeted query. Adding keywords to headings and use paragraph tags also helps. Keep in mind that if you want to be on a PAA snippet list for a particular question, you will want to make sure your content meets the News Publisher criteria for fact checks.Structured Data and PAAUtilizing structured data is a vital aspect to having your website provide answers on the PAA snippet. Using the Schema.org markup, answers can be provided in different forms, such as: specific questions from an FAQ or Q&amp;A page (Question markup), specific questions and their specific&nbsp;answers&nbsp;(QAPage markup) or instructions on how to achieve a result by following sequential steps (HowTo markup). Using these markups will make your content more likely to appear on the SERP as part of a PAA snippet. Read the full definitions of Question, QAPage and&nbsp;HowTo on Schema.FAQA Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page uses official questions from a website on a particular topic. Note that this is only for official answers and questions and should not include content submitted by other users. This rich snippet appears in a block comprising of a series of similar questions, similar to the PAA section. The block titles indicate more specific questions. A FAQ page is useful for:General business enquiriesInquiries arising from brand propertiesInquiries concerning long-form productsInquiries concerning specific productsEach question in a FAQ page depends on the answer provided. The more Google can provide answers, the more chances there are for users to find their way to the right website. For each section, it\u2019s recommended that you add a title describing the content of the questions as a means of content organization and helping Google identify your content.The FAQ type indicates that the page contains a question and answer excerpt. If the content is a long-form answer, you may want to consider including an FAQ section on your website.Structured Data and FAQNote that FAQ is a structured data dependent feature which uses the FAQPage schema markup. You can use the Structured Data Testing Tool to validate and preview your content. The full definition of FAQPage is available on Schema.HowToHowTo results are snippets that present instructions on completing a specific task or activity. These results can be categorized into varying types depending on the kind of details that need to be provided. The HowTo type indicates that the page contains a tutorial, a list of steps, or a list of actions. There are two types of HowTo types:A pre-filled HowTo type, represented by a container element containing steps or a list of steps.A more structured data-heavy HowTo type, represented by a child container item containing an HTML snippet.The former type is intended for informational content that answers questions, while the latter type is designed specifically for videos and other experiences that require viewers to follow a series or a chapter in order to be successful. Note that HowTo structure type does not include recipes, as that has its own form of structured data markup.Structured Data and HowToYou must include the required properties for HowTo pages for your content to be eligible to display it as a rich result. Most websites are able to display HowTo rich results regardless if they have HowTo structured data. You can use the Structured Data Testing Tool to validate and preview your structured data. Please note that HowTo pages may not appear in all languages. The full definition of HowTo is available at Schema.Answer Box ResultsThis is a snippet that you might see on the SERP for question queries like \u201cWhy can\u2019t I eat?\u201d The Answer Box usually appears at the top of the main feed under AdWords results. It\u2019s part of the core Knowledge Graph that contains other relevant contextual information like ratings and questions. When you click on it, you\u2018ll be taken to a result that lists the previous or current queries of the users.This feature is helpful for those users who can\u2019t provide a specified question, as the previous search results can show the answer. This feature is also useful for content creators, as it makes their content more likely to appear. This feature can also be seen in the Top Stories carousel.Structured Data and Answer Box ResultsWhile there isn\u2019t a specific markup of structured data that is utilized with the Answer Box Result, you can use HowTo, Question and QAPage to provide useful markup for your page. Providing keywords, entities (people, places, objects) and direct answers to a provided question can help to highlight your website.&nbsp;The full definitions of &nbsp;HowTo,&nbsp;Question&nbsp;and&nbsp;QAPage andcan be found on Schema.Explore PanelThe Explore Panel displays a card with up to seven images, a description (usually from wikipedia), important information, and related searches. In the above example of the \u201cBattle of Waterloo,\u201d the panel includes several images related to the event, a brief description linked to Wikipedia, some important information and related searches.Three factors drive the inclusion of infographic content in search results: relevance, the number of items to be shown, and the quality of the resulting presentation. Focusing on these factors will help provide enough content necessitate the inclusion of an Explore Panel.Structured Data and the Explore PanelStructured data relevance for the Explore Panel has not being documented by Google or suggested by anyone else for the moment being. Still, structured data may help Google better understand and classify your content in order to include it.Knowledge Graph CarouselThe Knowledge Graph Carousel features information from different sources that are grouped under a specific heading. The main benefit of this feature is the ability to provide more specific answers to a query. All items within a carousel must be of the same type, such as: a recipe or an article. Note that the Knowledge Graph Carousel does not include any Google ads.To maximize the visibility of your content, it is recommended to update your web pages with schema markup. This will make the content eligible for the Knowledge Graph feature. The Knowledge Graph Carousel contains information from Google's Knowledge Graph, which has a lot of different websites under its roof. It can help your site reach the right keywords by providing a better contextual link between the different websites. SEOs can then focus on optimizing websites to provide users with the information that Google needs.Structured Data and the Knowledge Graph CarouselUsing the ListItem markup will allow you to list the items that will be used for the carousel. This can be done as separately, listing all of the items linked to different pages; or as one page, providing the full information of each item. The full definition of ListItem is available at Schema.Site LinksGoogle Search can also expose sitelinks. This results in a white box with links to subsections of a website appearing under the results on the SERP, which can help users reach the right sections of a website. Google Search can also automatically add a sitelinks search box or sitelinks search result to your site if it can prove to Google that the search intent of the users is not being served the content through other means. Here is an example of a sitelinks search result, which is shown for searches related to 'DisneyWorld'The sitelinks feature includes an embedded search box that provides quick access to a website\u2019s search results. Google Search can automatically add this search box to your site if it detects content that qualifies as technical information for a search question or a result that answers a question.Structured Data and SitelinksA search box can also be added to your website, so long as you\u2019re using its own search engine embedded in the site. Then, use the WebSite schema markup to provide structured data for the search box. The full definition of WebSite can be found at Schema.Travel and TourismTravellers have mentioned that research is the most common way in which they make travel decisions after discovering different brands. In the current cyber world, 70% of this search is conducted on smartphones \u2014 and with the development of newer technologies, it can be expected that this will soon be done by virtual assistants and that there will be more options for travelers to choose from. In order to ensure that you stay relevant in this search process, it is necessary to include specific information that entices the researcher.Top things that people look for while they are planning their travel include prices, hotel reviews/pictures/cost/availability, travel schedules, and activities in the destination. Studies show that adding rich snippet content to your listing can boost click through rates by 30%. A brief description of how different organizations can achieve better results is given below.Recently, we did an experiment to estimate the impact of structured data on local SEO with Google My Business. The results are remarkable, you can find them on this Local SEO schema markup article.Google HotelsGoogle Hotels provides a selection of hotels to search for various hotels or similar accommodations. To attract users, it highlights important information about accommodations related to lodging business, accommodation type and price. The search results are often ranked and examined using information.Considering that 60% of travelers turn to search first when looking for accommodations \u2013 it\u2019s surprising that a large number of organizations aren\u2019t making use of the rich snippets feature! Continue reading to learn more about how you can incorporate structured data to use this feature to your advantage.Structured Data and Google HotelsYou can use the Hotel schema markup for adding structured data regarding your accommodation. The full definition of Hotel can be found at Schema.Google FlightsGoogle Flights is a snippet that acts as a flight finder embedded in the SERP. Airlines can use this feature to better understand the search intent of their users, and therefore what the users are looking for. If the users are looking for a flight to Miami, for example, the results will likely show a flight to Miami. However, When searching with pay per click, users may end up paying more for the same search result. It\u2019s a great feature from a users point of view; However, some website owners have taken issues with it.A booking engine such as FlightAdd can be used to make queries. The booking engine uses Google My Business and other relevant business information, and ranks the best available flights accordingly.Structured Data and Google FlightsYou can use the schema.org markup for Flight to add structured data to your flight. The rankings are based on a syndicated list of flights, which Google aggregates and displays in SERPs. The full definition of Flight can be found at Schema.&nbsp;Places and MapsPlaces and Maps is a snippet which brings up localized information about a place such as listed by a name or address. This feature is prominent on both desktop SERPs but more so with mobile results. Make sure to keep location information available and up-to-date along with key indicators that help Google identify the location, such as: names, addresses and contact information.Structured Data with Places and MapsStructured data relevance for the Places has not being documented by Google or suggested by anyone else for the moment being. Still, structured data may help Google better understand and classify your content in order to include it.News PublishingThe very first organic results page sees a traffic of about 32.5% while the 2nd page sees only 17.6%. These statistics bring to light the necessity of having a website display on the first results page. The carousel is often the first display that comes up when people are looking for something that is in the news. News websites and podcasts can greatly optimize their search engine presence by curating the content specifically for the news carousel and for the sport knowledge card.In order to increase the click through rate through a carousel, news sites must ensure that their platform uses structured data as recommended by Google. An easy- to-understand explanation of the different features that can be used to achieve better results is given in the following paragraphs.News Packs and CarouselGoogle Search can provide a carousel of rich results. In some cases, this content is delivered in AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) format, which is able to download and process data quickly.&nbsp;Create and include excellent web pages addressing specific keywords and optimize your site for mobile search and for each targeted intent. Use your website\u2019s keywords strategically, in SERPs that have higher KPI\u2019s. The News Carousel appears for search queries like \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d or \u201cThe story of Oskar Werner\u201d. It consists of up to nine links related to a specific topic.The News Packs are an expanded pack of all the major news sources into one big picture box. This results in a cleaner layout in Google Search results. To increase the CTRs of your news article, you should update your website with high-quality content and follow the guidelines to get into Top Stories.Structured Data and Google NewsTo increase the chances of being pulled into the News feed, it's recommended to follow general best practices for news reporting. In addition, news sites should have robust online presence and be actively engaged with Google\u2019s search algorithm and Google News content guidelines. In addition, using the ListItem schema markup to add structured data to your news content. The full definition of ListItem is available at Schema.Knowledge Cards &gt; SportsKnowledge cards for sports are cards displayed on the SERP that displays information related to current and future games featuring a specific team. These cards link to additional information related to games, news, players, and how the teams stand. This generally applies to more professional sports teams and leagues as opposed to minor teams.Structured Data and Knowledge Cards about SportsStructured data relevance for the Knowledge Cards about Sports has not being documented by Google or suggested by anyone else for the moment being. Still, structured data may help Google better understand and classify your content in order to include it.PodcastsA podcast carousel is a rich snippet that features different podcast shows or episodes To increase the chances of being pulled into the Podcast search box, it\u2019s recommended to follow general best practices for podcast SEO. That means including the target keywords in the content, optimizing the audio quality, and the RSS feed for the podcast in addition to using the proper structured data markup. In the case of news articles, Google may display the episode in its carousel.Structured Data and PodcastsThe RSS feed must conform to the RSS 2.0 specification and should contain the necessary tags and information. If you want your podcast to be featured in a carousel, make sure to use the ListItem schema markup.AMPAccelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) results, also called AMP highlights, are an expanded pack of all the necessary website\u2019s pages on your website that are now enhanced with interactive features. Responsive web design is preferred over classic SEO because it allows users to reach your website faster on mobile devices.These results include the full-width page that contains your page information. In fact, the result might display up to the page's width and height.Structured Data and AMPIn this case, specific structured data is not required, but AMPs are powerful if they include structured data.

The number of people buying goods online has increased, and will continue to do so.&nbsp;Considering this, it is going to be more and more important for retailers to optimize on their online visibility of products and drive more revenue. Rich snippets not only allow the brand to control the product information but they also give you the opportunity to stand out to people who are already looking for your product/service.For an e-commerce, shopping panels and ratings on Google\u2019s SERP can make the difference in terms of selling the goods or not. In this context, it\u2019s essential to learn how to get your spot on Google Shopping and structured data can help you with this: learn which other types of rich result can help and how in the following paragraphs.ShoppingShopping panels are rich snippets that contain information related to a product, business, or store. They include information such as reviews, addresses, hours of operation, etc. Remember, these are primarily paid listings, so you\u2019ll want to ensure that you keep listings active and relevant. Also, make sure you answer any and all questions that come your way.&nbsp;You should have a product page with product information, pricing, availability, security deposit and review details. You can also use the required structured data markup and gain rich results, such as local products. Shopping results on mobile still needs to be optimised, but overall site SEO should be a key for all online retailers.It\u2019s easy to optimize your products and services into Google Merchant centre. All you have to do is to add your products and services to your Google Merchant profile and link them to your store. Structured Data and ShoppingUsing the Product schema markup will help categorize and provide information and structured data to your website. The full definition of Product can be found at Schema.Ratings and ReviewsReviews and Ratings provide a qualitative description of your business, product or website. The Review property describes information about a review, such as the reviewer name, the date of the review, the length of the review, and the number of ratings. Users must have read reviews or ratings in places (schemas) that are search-engine results pages. Implementation involves preparing a page that contains a review of a product and then add the required markup. Reviews or ratings in schemas must meet the following criteria:Reviews must be genuine.Critic reviews or ratings should be genuine, not paid endorsements or promotional phrases.Promotional phrases and/or images must not be found in critic reviews or ratings.The aggregate score for all four critic reviews or ratings should not exceed the rated score.The pros of reviewing a product on a Google SERP are obvious: it increases your CTRs and searches. Reviews also bring traffic to your website, increase conversions and find plenty of satisfied customers. The downside is that if you are a marketer, you need to be on your website reviewing products to stay competitive. Reviews on a Google SERP can cost you up to 5% of your website rankings.The objective of the review is to give an honest and unbiased evaluation of a product, not to give a recommendation. Moreover, Google doesn\u2019t want your negative reviews to creep up the page, so you shouldn\u2019t include them. Structured Data and ReviewsNote that Reviews are a structured data dependent feature which uses the Review schema markup. The full definition of Review is available at Schema.Knowledge Panel &gt; BrandA knowledge panel for a brand, company or product can provide a brief description and important information related to the product. The descriptions are most often pulled from Wikipedia.org, so you may want to update a wikipedia page for your brand. Along with a description, other information can include: important people, founding year, type of product/service, related items and even fun facts about the company/brand. Make sure your content is up to date, of course, and that you carefully select which keywords are used.Structured Data and Knowledge Panel for BrandBrand structured data markup allows your website to appear in Google\u2019s relevant search results for your organization. The Search box appears mainly on desktop search results; however, it can be found also at the top of results in mobile results. The major benefit here is visibility \u2013 it offers a thorough overview of your website right on the results page (and often obscures ads that would otherwise appear in its place).Sitelinks and Jump-toGoogle Search can expose a Search box scoped to your website when it appears in the search results. This search box is powered by Google Search. However, if you wish to power this search box with your own search engine. If you want search results also include an associated mobile app, you can do so using structured data embedded on your website.Structured Data with Sitelinks and Jump-toUse the WebSite schema markup to provide structured data for the search box. This can be done with your website or app. The full definition of WebSite can be found at Schema.EntertainmentThe entertainment industry has never been such a complex mosaic as it is today, when old and new players are fighting to get the attention of the public. Google Search plays its role in this context giving to the searcher accurate information about any movie ever produced, movie showtimes and cast.&nbsp;&nbsp;Movie CarouselsUsing structured data markup can now be used with creating carousels of movie titles. These movie carousels can be used to display a series of movies based on parameters set by a user. Among these include: genre, actors, directors, studios, plot, etc.&nbsp;Structured Data and Movie CarouselsYou can use the Movie schema markup to add the required structured data markup for your website. Your structured data needs to follow the webmaster, carousel and general structured data guidelines. At minimum, you need to include a title and image, though it\u2019s also recommended to add an aggregate tag for average rating, a nested review, a director\u2019s name, and a release date for the movie. The full definition of Movie is available at Schema.Branding and Personal BrandingBuilding a brand or working on personal branding, in terms of SEO, basically means one thing: decide what you want people to see when they look for your brand or your name. The SERP that comes out from branded searches can and must be fully controlled by you, if you want it to be meaningful and clean. Your brand SERP visuals are especially important because it provides the audience with credible information that will influence their understanding/appreciation of the brand.One can establish themselves online through increasing visibility efforts on the databases that google pulls its information from. This will allow you to be a part of Google's knowledge graph entity. Structured data can help you, together with social media content (tweets, videos, LinkedIn profile, etc). A basic explanation of how this works is provided below.Knowledge CardKnowledge cards are rich snippet panels that depict a chart that came into being as the result of data agreement or human-edited data. As such, appearing in a search engine card is out of reach for most companies. However, it might still be useful to know which keywords affect these cards as it can tell you which keywords to search for.Structured Data and the Knowledge CardStructured data relevance for the Knowledge Card has not being documented by Google or suggested by anyone else for the moment being. Still, structured data may help Google better understand and classify your content in order to include it.Twitter BoxA twitter box is a rich snippet that features a direct link to a twitter account as well as the three most recent tweets from said account. For example, if you look up the Los Angeles Lakers, you can find a snippet of their twitter account and some of their recent posts.Structured Data and Twitter CardsStructured data are nor relevant in this case, as the tweets come directly from the social media.&nbsp;VideosVideos are extremely important for brands to have a clear position in Google SERPs. Videos can be shown for any search query. That means if you\u2019re a news portal, you can appear in SERPs with your videos. If you\u2019re a content provider, you can provide a video to users for free. Though if your video clip is not loading or has no video information, it may lead to lower CTRs.&nbsp;Uploading and managing a video on a youtube channel is a chapter on its own. With a good marketing strategy, it can also bring higher CTRs. If you decide to host a video on your own channel, you have to include proper structured data markup. Please, refer to Google guidelines. It\u2019s easier to appear as a video thumbnail in SERPs with youtube video.&nbsp;In the case of news portals, it\u2019s probably a good idea to update your video descriptions with thumbnail images. In the case of video carousels, it\u2019s probably a good idea to link your video to a youtube channel.Structured Data and VideosImage markup is preferable, but not required. The width and height of the video should reflect the visual content. The description should include keywords and should clearly and specifically identifies the video as a whole. The description should be relevant and unique.FoodYummy recipes look yummier on the SERP if they have a rich snippet. Recipe snippets include images, reviews, cooking times, ingredients and much more. Besides helping your recipe get a rich snippet and therefore a higher CTR, your structured data will also help Google read the details of your recipe and serve it to the right searcher understanding if it's dairy free or not, how many eggs are needed and stuff like that.Let's see how it works.&nbsp;RecipesRecipe rich snippets are rich results that include both text and a list of items to be eaten. In recipes, the TAB key is used to list the items to be eaten.To increase the CTRs of your recipe listings, you should update the database with the latest information regarding their availability. In most cases, this will require contacting the previous owners of the recipes. If you find yourself in a position where your recipe listings are not very popular, you can always try to add more information to the database, which could lead to a higher CTR.In some cases, the content within a recipe can be more valuable than the search result, so seek out opportunities where your content can provide value to the user. For example, place a special order for fresh ingredients or make special dietary adjustments.Structured Data and RecipesThe ItemList schema markup is crucial to appear in host-specific links or carousels. You can use the markup to add details about the name, cuisine type, and other information related to your recipe. The Recipe markup is also useful for adding more specific information to your recipe that can be used in combination with HowTo and PAA rich snippets. The full definition of ItemList&nbsp;and Recipe can be found at Schema.RecruitmentCompanies that are trying to hire a new employee might face difficulties because they are unable to reach the intended target group. Interestingly, 82% of Fortune 500 executives believe that their companies do not recruit top talent. In this scenario, ensuring that the posting is visible on search engines and recruiting platforms is key. Keeping important details in mind and using structured data markup helpers can largely influence the visibility and compatibility to candidates. For example, structured data can greatly help attract attention to your job posting using the JobPosting schema markup. The following paragraphs describe how organizations can achieve a better response. Job SearchA job posting is a rich snippet that contains public information, means that anyone can apply while a job posting that is private, means that only employees may apply. The former type of job posting is known as \"openings.\" The latter type of job posting is known as a \"closed captioning.\"Job postings must fairly represent the hiring organization and job to be performed by the applicant.Here are a number of important details to keep in mind when posting your job within a job search:The job can be performed at a remote location in either Michigan or Texas, but not both. Use jobLocation, jobLocationType, and applicantLocationRequirements.Ensure that the new job posting is displaying for applicants from the original job seeker. This helps Google differentiate legitimate applicants from rip-offs.Provide applicant details, such as the job title, when applying for the remote job.Make sure prospective employees know that you have jobs at remote locations and ensure that job postings are accurate.The listing must be relevant and interesting to the search query. It should not be too broad or not very specific \u2013 just enough to give an idea of what the user is looking for.The job posting must provide details about the hiring organization and job location. It should not merely define the job title or description.Structured Data and Job SearchStructured data can be used to help attract attention to your job posting using the JobPosting schema markup. Using the Structured Data Markup Helper, you can directly paste a URL Link or HTML script into the helper to develop a structured data set. The details listed above should provide information needed for the development of the structured content. The full definition of JobPosting is available at Schema.Don\u2019t forget to remove your job posting once the job expires. You can do this by removing the JobPosting data, deleting the page, or ensure the validThrough property is tagged and set to a date when the offer expires.Retail BusinessIn continuation of the retail apocalypse, which started in 2010, it is further expected that around 14000 stores will close by the end of 2020. While e-commerce is the main cause of this, online marketplaces such as Amazon have still been able to expand from online to retail stores. Through these dynamic changes taking place, we know that particularly retail businesses need to consider methods to have a legitimate online presence in order to stay relevant in the future.This allows the consumers to reach the most reliable information and spread digital awareness of their business. Some options to further boost the search optimization might include creating a google profile, displaying a critical review and adding it to the local business listing. Continue reading to learn about the different ways in which you can achieve this.&nbsp;Google My BusinessGoogle My Business is a free service provided by Google that allows you to manage your business profile and information across Google\u2019s platforms, particularly Google Maps. Google My Business also enables a business owner to directly connect with their clients and potential customers using Google\u2019s services.Structured Data and Google My BusinessStructured Data is not relevant or useful for Google My Business, as this information is created and accessed through a Google account using Google My Business rather than from your website. It is nonetheless essential for any business seeking to increase their online and mobile presence.Critic Reviews&nbsp;A critic review is a snippet of a much longer, more detailed review of a product, movie, book, or local business. They differ from the standard review rich snippets in that critic reviews focus on one or a few individual reviews of a business rather than the overall rating of a business by several, public reviews. An example of a critic review can be seen below for 230 Fifth Rooftop Bar in New York City.It\u2019s important to keep several things in mind when implementing critic review rich snippets:Critic reviews must be genuine and cannot be auto-generated, written by the business, and must be an excerpt from a longer review. There cannot be any commercial agreements (paid or otherwise) between the critic and business.Reviews cannot exceed 200 characters.No third-party or syndicated reviews will be allowed, only those directly produced by your site are permissible.Reviews on the website must allow customers to express positive or negative opinions and cannot be vetted by the business based on its verdict.Structured Data and Critic ReviewsTo add critic reviews, use the required structured data markup using the Review schema markup. The full definition of Review can be found at Schema.Local Business ListingA listing for a local business provides information for the knowledge graph and rich results on the SERP. Using a local business listing, you can provide information about things like: business hours, different departments within your business, reviews, contact information and more. You can also use a listing to provide ways for users to make reservations, payments and other actions. This can be done for a variety of businesses from restaurants to travel agencies.Structured Data and Local Business ListingsFor local business listings, structured data is required for rich snippets as they can be useful in providing information to search engines and viewers alike. The LocalBusiness markup on Schema can be particularly useful and there are also a variety of other markups for differing types of businesses. These can include markups such as AnimalShelter, Dentist, Store, HomeAndConstructionBusiness, and many others. The full definition of LocalBusiness and the full list of business type markups can be found on Schema.FAQAn FAQ rich snippet can be particularly useful for a local business providing a product or service that people frequently have questions about. If you don\u2019t have an FAQ page and many customers come to you with questions about the service you provide, consider adding an FAQ page to your website. If you already have an FAQ page, you may be interested in gaining an FAQ featured snippet on the Google SERP.Structured Data and FAQsTo get an FAQ snippet on the SERP, you will need to use the FAQPage structured data. Please make sure that the entirety of the text in both each Question and Answer are included as the entire question and answer may be displayed. The full definition of FAQPage can be found on Schema.SoftwareSince software is a product that is made primarily for usage in the cyber world, it is crucial for the business to have a legitimate online presence. The SERP that comes out from searches can and must be fully controlled by you, in order to reach the audience directly. Further, trying to use new softwares can often seem intimidating and complicated.Software websites should attract people to their services by making their content easy to access and understand. Companies can make use of structured data with FAQS, application downloads, HowTo articles and videos to demonstrate their content. The following paragraphs describe how organizations can achieve a better online return rate through semantic tools.HowToHowTo rich snippets can be particularly useful for a software website to provide content and tutorials relating to their software. This also includes technology enthusiasts who would like to provide their own tutorials or software demonstrations. For example, creating a website using WordPress can be displayed in the HowTo type snippet displayed above.Structured Data and HowToYou must include the required properties for HowTo pages for your content to be eligible to display it as a rich result. Most websites are able to display HowTo rich results regardless if they have HowTo structured data, but this is no guarantee that yours will be displayed without the use of structured data. You can use the Structured Data Testing Tool to validate and preview your structured data. Please note that HowTo pages may not appear in all languages. The full definition of HowTo is available at Schema.FAQAn FAQ rich snippet can be particularly useful to software developers, distributors and even enthusiasts. An FAQ page can answer frequently asked questions about the software in question or its function. It can also be used to provide common inquiries about the software as a product or service. An FAQ snippet result can easily provide users with easy answers to their questions in a simple, but useful format.&nbsp;Structured Data and FAQIn order to get an FAQ rich snippet on the Google SERP use the FAQPage structured data from Schema. Please be sure that the entirety of the text in both each Question and Answer are included as the entire question and answer may be displayed. This is especially important for technical information as you may need to provide as much detail as possible in your answers. The full definition of FAQPage can be found on Schema.VideosHowTo is not the only means of providing tutorials or demonstration content, videos can provide an equally beneficial means of doing so. When it comes to many types of software, especially visual-based software, embedded videos in the SERP can provide a convenient method of delivering tutorial and demonstration content. Make sure your video follows the proper guidelines for it to be featured in the SERP as part of a video carousel.&nbsp;Structured Data and VideosImage markup is preferable but is not required. The width and height of the video should reflect the visual content. The description should include keywords and should clearly and specifically identify the video content as a whole. The description must also be relevant and unique.App DownloadIf you\u2019re seeking to promote a mobile application, you can have it appear in the SERP for a snippet to conveniently display your application. Use SoftwareApp for your app to be eligible for this feature. The new SERP features are available to users in the U.S. and Canada.&nbsp;Structured Data and Software AppThe SoftwareApplication schema markup is used for adding structured data to applications. App download links are now also enabled for any apps on the Google Play store. The WebApplication and MobileApplication subtypes for markups are also supported by Google. The full definition of SoftwareApp is available at Schema.OutroWhen it comes to optimizing your website for Google\u2019s SERP, being the first blue link doesn\u2019t hold the same value that it used to. That\u2019s why it\u2019s more important to focus on developing structured data so that your website can be featured in a rich snippet. These rich snippets are both more engaging and reliable to users, hence why they\u2019ve taken much of the spotlight over the past couple of years. In understanding how the different types or rich snippets work and how you might begin to optimize your website\u2019s content and function.We hope this guide has been both informative and useful in providing you with the knowledge on SERP rich snippets and structured data.

        "text": "Mobile First Indexing and the Changing Nature of SEO What is Mobile First Indexing?\rMobile first indexing is the manner in which Google has begun to organize their SERP by basing its rankings and website indexing off of features and structured data that caters to a mobile version of Google. Essentially, Google is focused on ranking and indexing websites that provide mobile-friendly versions of websites that have features, such as structured data for featured snippets and content optimized for voice search.\r\rThis runs contrary to the prior indexing system of desktop first indexing, where the desktop version would be indexed first and mobile versions of websites would be boosted on mobile results only after the desktop version was ranked. The new focus of Mobile first indexing is to encourage further development and prioritization of mobile-friendly web pages and structured data that Google can use on their mobile-focused SERP.\rHow Mobile First Indexing changed SEO\rThe nature of mobile first indexing has changed the SERP\u2019s priorities to focus on providing engaging results for mobile platforms. These changes have prioritized the use of rich snippets over the standard blue links that were the focus of the past, changing the way SEO is being done. Google seeks to provide answers to queries rather than links to pages, and focuses on entities over keywords and providing direct answers in order to accomplish this goal.\r\rIn essence, the manner in which\u00a0SEO is done has changed in a variety of ways:\r\r \tEntities overtaking keywords in importance\r \tFeatured snippets on the SERP\r \tFraggles providing direct answers to queries\u00a0\r\rEntities vs. Keywords\rIn the past, keywords were the driving factor in SEO management; However, while keywords still play a major role in SEO, they have taken a back seat to entities. Entities are people, places, or concepts that are explicit and can be used in every language. Keywords, on the other hand, are distinctive words used to connect content containing those words to users using those words in a search query.\u00a0\r\r\r\rCindy Krum, the CEO of Mobile Moxie, describes the relation of entities and keywords in a webinar with Gennaro of WordLift. She made the case of how a mother is related to a father, who is related to a daughter, who is related to a grandfather. The words themselves may be different in other languages but the concepts can be useful in every language. While a keyword could be the word mother, the concept of a mother could be an entity.\r\rWhile there is a lot of overlap between keywords and entities, as both can encompass the other, the key difference is that keywords used in a search query are directly tied to those same keywords being on a webpage whereas entities are the concepts behind which the user is searching for.\rThe use of Structured Data &amp; Featured Snippets\r\r\rThe featured snippets (I.E. those boxes and carousels that provide direct and engaging content) have become more prominent than the regular blue links. This is not only because those snippets are more engaging and provides a direct inquiry, but also because they are much more user-friendly on mobile devices. Featured snippets include: HowTo, Events, Knowledge Panels, Carousels, People Also Ask, etc.\r\rIt\u2019s important to focus on these snippets, as while being highly ranked among the regular blue links is still important, it has lost some of its value to the featured snippets, as now the first blue link result could be one-third or even halfway down the SERP. In addition, these snippets are more convenient for the user, as they provide direct inquiries rather than a link that provides a potential resolution to their query.\u00a0\r\rTo increase the chances of being featured in one of these rich snippets, it\u2019s important to optimize your website content to make it as useful as possible and to provide structured data for these snippets. Structured data utilizes schema markup from schema.org. Different snippet types will use different markup to categorize and organize information.\rThe Rise of Fraggles\rFraggles are fragments of a website (such as a page, piece of information, etc.) that can not only be linked to from the SERP, but display important information on Google\u2019s SERP as an answer query. Google has begun to heavily test and implement fraggles into their results query, and will likely begin to continuously implement them into the SERP. They\u2019ve become especially important as Google has shifted the SERP\u2019s priorities from providing links to websites, to providing answers to users questions.\r\r\r\rIf you take mobile-first indexing into consideration, the increased use of fraggles begins to make sense as Google seeks to cater and provide information to users on mobile results. Fraggles enable Google to provide the answers that people seek on desktop, mobile &amp; voice search.\r\rGetting your webpage included among these fraggles means that you have to provide the answers people are seeking. Using structured data for rich snippets is part of what can help and focusing your SEO on entities, as mentioned previously, will help Google understand your website and webpages. Optimizing your content to be query-friendly also helps fulfill Google\u2019s quota for an optimized inclusion in their results.\u00a0\rDon\u2019t Panic!\rWhile these changes may be difficult to manage and present serious challenges to SEO, there\u2019s no need to panic. While the SERP priorities have shifted from desktop to mobile, that doesn\u2019t mean that everything you know about SEO needs to be thrown out. Much of SEO still applies even if it has taken a new shape and there are different factors that need to be considered.\r\rFocusing on providing structured data, optimizing your content, and utilizing entities can go a long way in increasing your odds of being featured on the SERP. WIth a little work and a little patience, you can get your website back on track with Google\u2019s changes to their SERP formatting and organization.\r\rIf you\u2019re interested in more information on mobile first indexing, check out Cindy Krum\u2019s webinar with WordLift.

        "text": "Case Studies on how the SERP has Changed Cindy Krum, the CEO of MobileMoxie, in a recent webinar with WordLift\u2019s own, Gennaro Cuofano, discussed the changing nature of Google SERP, what it means to be the #1 result in 2019, and future of SEO overall. While the discussion primarily focused on rich snippets, mobile-first indexing, and the use of fraggles; Cindy highlighted two other important changes using case studies on the SERP.\r\rThe first of these case studies, related to panic rooms, was focused on getting a hosted inclusion on the SERP while the other of these case studies, focused on running shoes, was related to the changing function of paid results. Both tell important stories about the changing nature of the SERP, though they are small potatoes in the grand scheme of things.\rPanic Room Supplies\rTrying to find panic supplies for a panic room isn't as easy as we origninally thought.\r\rIf you\u2019re panicking about the latest changes to SEO technology, you might want to try to hide in a panic room. Though without supplies, we won\u2019t last long, so let\u2019s try to find some supplies for our SEO panic room. If we try to search for a \u2018panic room,\u2019 the first results are of a movie, which is what we don\u2019t want. If we narrow it by category and location to \u2018panic room supplies Anchorage,\u2019 what we get are results for an escape room, which is practically the opposite of what we want. If we try again by searching \u2018panic room supplies,\u2019 we get a little closer to what we want, with results displaying what to pack for supplies in a panic room but not how to acquire these supplies.\r\rBased on our three search queries, none of them provided us with what we were looking for, a place to purchase panic supplies. If we were a business trying to sell and advertise panic supplies, our business would be struggling as people are having trouble trying to find us. Instead, they\u2019re finding things like map packs, movies, and guides that are vaguely related to the search query.\r\r\r\rIn order to get the hosted inclusion that was needed, we needed to plan things out by taking a step back and looking at what was happening behind the scenes. Taking 6 cities and the top 5 keywords for our subject matter (supplies for a panic room) and charting them out to decipher the top rankings. Separated between the Apple and Android operating systems, the searches presented the top-ranking results for each keyword. Things like the presence of paid results, rich snippets, google\u00a0knowledge graph results and map packs were also present.\rHosted Inclusions\rIf you\u2019re wondering why you might not be getting traffic, paying attention to what else is going on in the search queries is always a good start to understanding your SEO position. From there, you can understand what\u2019s going on around you and begin to focus attention on distinguishing your website and getting that hosted inclusion. Trying to get it might not be easy if your result is cluttered among vaguely similar results, but a proper focus on understanding keywords and entities (concepts and how we attribute these concepts) can help organize your information. Using a charting methodology like the one used above can also help you identify which keywords you might need to use to attract local attention.\rRunning Shoes\rIf a panic room isn\u2019t available to you, you might instead try to run, but you won\u2019t get very far in dress shoes or high heels. So, let\u2019s set out to find the best running shoes so that we can flee the situation if need be. In searching for the best running shoes, we found a variety of carousels, knowledge panels\u00a0and rich snippets detailing information about the models, brands, and types of running shoes.\r\r\r\rWhat you might also notice about the SERP is that among some of these specialized results and rich snippets, that some of these are paid ads. These ads are not just limited to regular blue links, but rather are part of the google\u00a0knowledge graph and appear much more specialized than even certain varieties of rich snippets. Not only have organic results begun to change, but paid results have put much more focus on rich snippets and delivering results directly in the SERP.\rEngaging Paid Results\r\r\rPreviously, paid results were merely blue links pushed to the top and marked with an AD tag, now they comprise of much more than that. With more detailed and engaging results, it\u2019s become more difficult to compete with paid results, especially if you\u2019re focusing more exclusively on the blue links aspect of the SERP. Although you cannot compete with these paid results in the same manner that you could compete with organic results, all is not necessarily lost here. Focusing on being the top organic result is still beneficial as well as making sure that your getting the hosted inclusions both for the blue links and GKG can help even if there\u2019s paid content at the very top.\rThe Takeaway\rWhile some of these changes highlighted by the case studies might present challenges or be scary to some, but there\u2019s no need to go hide in a panic room or run off as fast as you can. A better option is to instead, look at what\u2019s going on in the SERP and what people who are looking for your website might be finding instead. Paying careful attention to local searches and finding the best keywords and entities to match will also go a long way in helping you get the hosted inclusions that you want. Beyond that, simply focusing on optimizing your website and content should help you pull through in changing times.\r\rTo learn more about how you can improve your SEO strategy and these case studies, check out Cindy Krum\u2019s webinar here on WordLift.

        "text": "Top 7 WooCommerce SEO Plugins in 2022 The world of SEO plugins is a vast one.

These basics include automatically optimizing your titles, automatically generating meta tags, automatic checks for duplicate content, and support for creating your XML sitemap.WooCommerce SEO by WordLiftGetting your products to display properly in Google Product listings is typically a tedious, time-consuming task that involves a significant amount of trial and error.

Off-page SEO aims to improve the relevance, trustworthiness, and authority of your site in the eyes of the search engines.

Within this dashboard, you can keep an eye out for bad or spam sites that link to your site, which can cause a penalty on your site if you do not disavow those links. It also provides tracking of your competitors\u2019 backlinks, giving you a consistent source of other sites you can reach out to and request backlinks from.SEO Optimized ImagesAs an e-commerce site, you probably have tons of images throughout the content of your site. While these images may make your site look appealing to customers, they can also help your site\u2019s SEO if appropriately optimized. SEO Optimized Images help you do just that. The basics of this plugin automatically optimize the title and alt attributes of the images on your site to coincide with the keywords you\u2019re targeting. Their pro version extends these features also to optimize your WooCommerce product images and featured images.

For absolute beginners, you may want to start with All in One SEO for its simple interface and overall ease of use. When you\u2019re ready to move beyond All in One SEO and really start optimizing your site\u2019s SEO, look to WooCommerce SEO by WordLift to truly optimize your e-commerce site if your focus is increasing your traffic and sales.

        "text": "What Should your Brand SERP look like? Educated, polite people shouldn\u2019t care about what other people think about them. It would be vanity. That\u2019s most usually true, but there\u2019s an entity whose opinion you should care about. That\u2019s Google. When someone googles your brand name (or personal name), Google shows the results that it feels are most valuable and relevant to its user, meaning that your Brand SERP reflects Google\u2019s perception of your brand in the context of your audience.&nbsp;That means there is no such thing as a typical Brand SERP - the variety is HUGE since each brand is unique, its digital ecosystem is unique and its audience is unique. Then add to the mix that the geolocation of the user plays a major role in not only the results themselves but the anatomy/layout of the search results page... and you get an unimaginable variety.&nbsp;1. What should your Brand SERP should look like if you're an International, National or Local Business?2. International Brands2.1. Blue links2.2. Rich Elements / SERP features2.3.

Rich Elements / SERP features4.3. Right Rail / Knowledge Panel5. And the Grand Finale\u20266. Don\u2019t Leave Your Brand SERP to ChanceWhat should your Brand SERP look like if you\u2019re an International, National or Local Business?Kalicube has a database of almost 5 million Brand SERPs for over 75,000 brands that cover 11 countries and 626 industries, so we can provide you with a good idea of what a typical Brand SERP might look like.In this article, I\u2019ll present schematised versions of what you can expect as a major international brand, a national brand or a local bricks and mortar business. Expect another article soon that covers what a Personal Brand SERP (i.e. your name) typically contains. As a preparatory exercise,&nbsp;have a look at mine.&nbsp;Iconography used in the examples belowInternational BrandsImportantly, the Brand SERP for an international brand will vary significantly from country to country. Here is the example of Adobe Systems across the 6 anglophone countries we track at Kalicube. As you can see, not only the results, but also the anatomy can change significantly.&nbsp;Why is that? Because, as we saw at the start, Google shows the brand\u2019s audience what is most relevant and valuable for them and in different countries the audience engages differently with the brand. It is logical that the results are very different (and a good user experience).Blue linksBlue links remain the backbone and foundation on which every SERP is built, as Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dubut from Bing makes very clear in&nbsp;this interview.&nbsp;At the top, logically one expects to see the brand\u2019s own homepage, followed by rich sitelinks. At this point, many marketers think \u201cjob done\u201d. But ranking #1 for your own brand name is just the start, as we\u2019ll see.The number of traditional blue links varies - between 4 and 10. The exact number depends on the presence of rich elements (SERP features), the range of brands and products owned by the company and the ambiguity of the brand name (more ambiguous names will tend to have longer SERPs, as Nathan Chalmers from Bing&nbsp;explains here). The choice of blue links varies enormously depending on the brand\u2019s digital ecosystem in the given country.&nbsp;Typically, one or two of the brand\u2019s social profile pages will rank (localised if the brand has a dedicated social account for the country). If one exists, the brand\u2019s Wikipedia article will be present more often than not. After that, the list varies a lot, depending heavily on the brand\u2019s industry and its offers and services: a review platform, an app platform (if they have an app), an article from a media platform, a company profile (Crunchbase, for example).Percentage of total blue links occupied by specific sites in Brand SERPs for international brands&nbsp;Rich Elements / SERP featuresThe presence of a rich element will often eliminate a blue link. For larger brands, the average number of rich elements (Video Boxes, People Also Ask, Twitter Boxes, Image Boxes) in the left rail is just under 1.5. This average seems to me to be low given that, to trigger these, a brand simply needs to have an effective, well focussed and engaging content strategy. As a prospect or client, to be convincing, I would expect the Brand SERP to contain at least two, and preferably three rich elements.&nbsp;There is obviously enormous variation here. Some extremes: in the USA, CNN (who have an amazing content strategy) has 6, whereas Spanfeller Media Group (who have a non-existent content strategy) has none.Right Rail / Knowledge PanelJust under 45% of brands have a knowledge panel. When Google shows a knowledge panel, it is confident it has correctly understood who the brand is and what it offers. Two-thirds of those (so 30% of all brands) have People Also Search For / Related Entities in their knowledge panel. These tend to be either other brands that are part of the same business group or brands that Google sees as being in the same market. Since the competitors are often different in different countries, these entity boxes often vary from country to country. But that is a story for another day :)Here are some \u2018typical\u2019 Brand SERPs for international brands. You might not be CNN (see the example above) but, as an international brand, this is the very minimum you should expect.&nbsp;WordLift can help you shape your SERPs.Want to find out how?Book a demo with our expertsNational brandAlthough there is significantly less variation than international brands, national variations for Brand SERPs is also a fact of (marketing) life. Here is the example of Preston Baker (a national UK Estate Agency chain) across three towns. Once again, not only the results, but also the anatomy changes significantly.&nbsp;Blue linksGenerally fairly stable across a smaller country like the UK, less so for larger countries such as the US, the blue links will often adapt to the geolocation of the user. Examples would be localised review sites, local news and media, localised social media accounts, and local bloggers.Rich Elements / SERP featuresIn a national scenario, these do not vary a great deal, as a rule. A great Twitter strategy or video strategy will generally trigger those rich elements across the entire country since the audience is likely to be engaging in a similar manner.&nbsp;The rich sitelinks are probably the most prone to regional variations for a brand with multiple branches - the page on the brand\u2019s website for the nearest branch will often get a place. Why? Because Google\u2019s aim with those rich sitelinks is to enable its users to get to the page on your site that will be most helpful to them as efficiently as possible. Suppose Google has a good enough understanding of the site\u2019s structure, and a dedicated page for a nearby branch is available. In that case, Google will display that link in the rich sitelinks under the homepage.&nbsp;&nbsp;Right Rail / Knowledge PanelThe variation here is generally focussed around Google My Business. If the company has a local branch, then that will appear on the right.If the brand has multiple branches in the locality, then a Map Pack appears in the left rail, and no GMB in the right rail (read on for some exceptions).&nbsp;If the company does not have local branches but the head offices of the company are nearby, then the GMB will probably appear. The GMB can be unpredictable in other towns - sometimes appearing even when the user is hundreds of miles away.&nbsp;In all these cases, if the brand has a knowledge panel, then it will either show instead of the GMB (when the user is not near a branch or office), or it will be shown below the GMB panel as a full knowledge panel or a \u201cSee Results About\u201d. If there is a Map Pack, it gets top billing (see the rather extreme Halifax example at the end of the article)Local bricks and MortarHere we\u2019ll focus on the typical result for a local search on your local business. This is the simplest and most predictable in terms of blue links, types of sites, right rail and rich elements.Blue linksIn local, social media accounts, directories and review sites dominate. And the list is fairly logical and obvious (once you\u2019ve seen it :) Local search marketers will \u2018naturally\u2019 be focussing on these Usual Suspects!Rich Elements / SERP featuresThese will vary little, as a rule. For a local business, a great Twitter or video strategy will easily trigger those rich elements. The rich sitelinks require that you have a site that has a page for each service offering, plus the typical (simple and obvious) pages that explain who you are, where to find you and how to contact you - About Us, Contact, Our Team, Customer Feedback etc.&nbsp;Why? Because Google\u2019s aim with those rich sitelinks is to enable its user to get relevant information about you as efficiently as possible. It has no reason not to provide first-party content if it feels that it is an honest and helpful representation of the business.Right Rail / Knowledge PanelYou\u2019ll expect to see the GMB listing. And dealing with that is \u2018classic\u2019 local SEO. Optimise your GMB listing - it is by far the single most important part of SEO in the context of a local bricks and mortar business.Beyond that, if a knowledge panel exists, it will show below the GMB either in full or as a \u201cSee Results About\u201d link.&nbsp;If the brand has multiple branches in the locality, then a Map Pack appears in the left rail, and no GMB in the right rail. In which case, if a knowledge panel exists, you may see it in its full glory panel on the right (this is not systematic).Here are two examples of good Local Brand SERPs.And the Grand Finale...Goes to the Halifax Bank - a national brand in the UK with multiple outlets in most cities in the country. They manage to fit almost every case I mention above in one neat super-multimedia Brand SERP!Google clearly understands the brand, is comfortable with its well organised site, sees that the press coverage is relevant, and perceives the content strategy as valuable to its users. They control almost everything and have killed almost all the blue links!Speaking of grand finales: did you know you can try WordLift for free for 14 days?Let me try it for free!Don\u2019t Leave Your Brand SERP to ChanceA typical Brand SERP doesn\u2019t exist. What Google shows for an exact match search results page for your brand depends on many, many factors including (but not limited to) industry, ambiguity of the name, geolocation, content strategy, social media strategy, Google\u2019s Knowledge Graph, Google My Business...&nbsp;As we\u2019ve demonstrated again and again at Kalicube, you don\u2019t need to passively accept what Google chooses to show your audience when they search your brand. Whether you are a national, international or local brand, you can actively control your Brand SERP: the choice of blue links (social profiles, reviews, apps, articles, company profiles, software depositories\u2026), the rich elements (all you need is a convincing and relevant content strategy), the contents of the knowledge panel and GMB in the right rail.&nbsp;My advice for 2021 - start to \u2018design\u2019 your \u2018Google business card\u2019 and make it accurate, positive and convincing to your audience, whoever they are and wherever they might be.[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

It\u2019s like finding a diamond in a coalmine\u2014every time we search\u2014without dirtying ourselves in the coal.\u201dExcerpt From: Scoble, Robert. Age of Context: Mobile, Sensors, Data and the Future of Privacy.To use author\u2019s Robert Scoble\u2019s comparison, technology today helps us \u201cfind diamonds in a coalmine.\u201c In search, these diamonds (i.e. the chunks of information relevant to the query) are created with&nbsp;structured data. And here we are not talking about&nbsp;rich snippets&nbsp;only, although they are paramount to SEO success. We are talking about how on one hand structured data underpins a business-critical aspect of SEO and that is semantic search, and, on the other hand, it powers e-commerce SEO by optimizing product pages with a product knowledge graph for e-commerce SEO.And I know so far I didn\u2019t tell you anything new. The force of structured data has been with SEO jedis for quite some time and its&nbsp;strategic value is recognized now. To get back to the rich snippets - powered by structured markup, these \u201cdiamonds\u201d drive quality traffic, build brand awareness, increase click-through rates - ultimately connect people to businesses in a cost-effective way. They are a major tool for mobile visibility and click-throughs too. What hasn\u2019t been on the radar of SEO, though is an element worth considering in an environment where people want \u201cdiamonds\u201d quickly and easily.This is a structured data element and it is hot off the press. The GS1 Digital Link.What is GS1 Digital Link and Why Is It Important for SEO? Great, but how does exactly GS1 Digital Link Work? How Can You Use GS1 Digital Link for SEO [Spoiler: Visual Search] Two Visual Search Scenarios How E-commerce page optimization can benefit from GS1 Digital Link GS1 Digital Link as only the Tip of the Iceberg called Product Knowledge Graph GS1 Digital Link Quick Reference for Your Next Client Structured data on! What is GS1 Digital Link and Why Is It Important for SEO?GS1 Digital Link (GS1 DL) is a descendant of the well-known barcode but can carry much more data than its antecedent. And this alone reduces the need for multiple codes on a pack. Something more, GS1 DL provides a standard way of expressing data in a format that can be used on the Web, which can directly put a product through its barcode in a linked environment.&nbsp;Case in point, a GTIN (the unique product identifier that provides accurate and rich product information to Google, Bing and other marketplaces) can be encoded into a Web address,&nbsp;following GS1 Digital Link standard specifications. The latter is essential, as GS1 standards are the most widely used system of standards in the world, much like W3C are, and with them, anyone can convert a GTIN into a web address.&nbsp;Great, but how does exactly GS1 Digital Link Work?So here is how GS1 Digital Link works.Let\u2019s look at \u201cDal Giardino Extra Virgin Olive Oil Exclusive Selection\u201d as a reference product. Its unique product identifier is GTIN 9506000134369, which corresponds to a GS1 barcode that you will find printed on its bottle label. Using this unique ID we can obtain its web address&nbsp;https://id.gs1.org/01/9506000134369. Now this one looks like a normal URL, but it\u2019s a linked data URI instead and can:&nbsp;Redirect the end-user to the product information pageProvide structured information about the olive oil that machines like Google understand (using schema.org or&nbsp;GS1 Web Vocabulary)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Technically speaking, GS1 digital link specifications express GTINs as URLs. Also, GS1 Digital Link is an element of the structured data pack in&nbsp;https://schema.org/Product&nbsp;and provides the structure for information about a product, such as expiration dates, nutritional and medical product data, warranty registration, troubleshooting instructions, even social media links.&nbsp;It is important for SEO because with GS1 Digital Link, as with any unique identifier, the product URL and Unique Identifiers are separated, meaning together with the web page, a URI contains all the data good for the crawlers separated from the page.&nbsp;Case in point, visual search.How Can You Use GS1 Digital Link for SEO [Spoiler: Visual Search]When there is search, there is search engine optimization. In this case, we might call it, as Semrush did,&nbsp;visual search&nbsp;engine optimization.&nbsp;We know that due to mobile devices' dominance in the shopping journey,&nbsp;62 percent of people want visual search capabilities. It\u2019s crucial to enable them to search quickly, discover and identify the products on their mobile devices that they\u2019re inspired by and seek to purchase.&nbsp;To clarify, below we have listed two scenarios. One of them is the one we, as users, have all experienced: we see something that we like, we scan it with Google Lens and then we get some results to sort through by ourselves. The other scenario is the one with GS1 DL, where we scan the barcode of the thing we liked and access a network of information about it. With one snap.Two Visual Search Scenarios&nbsp;And visual search is only part of the puzzle. E-commerce page optimization as a whole is another. In the paragraph below we explain why.How E-commerce page optimization can benefit from GS1 Digital LinkAs Aleyda Solis aptly advises:&nbsp;\u201cOur goal with category pages should be then to feature information that confirms the features/functionalities/USPs of that particular set of products, clarifies any common doubts about them, informs about any existing offers and why/how the user is in the best place to buy them, as a salesperson would do at a physical store at that point in the customer journey.\u201d(Cit. Optimizing Content in Category Pages while Keeping its Commercial Nature)Now add to that some algorithmic power a GS1 Digital Link. The content for category and product pages will serve the user\u2019s intent and, on top of it, provide them with a richer than expected experience&nbsp;by serving machines what they want - clean and structured data.Further, once connected these data can be accessed via the GS1 Digital link, that is&nbsp;from any store through a scan, given there is a barcode on the product.Optimizing content with markup will also allow Google and other search engines to populate search features, such as product Knowledge Panels or Google\u2019s mobile Popular Products carousel (Learn more at&nbsp;https://wordlift.io/blog/en/seo-trends/#_ecom1). And what is more important in the age of&nbsp;entity-based search: create connections within the Knowledge Graph for&nbsp;easier entity recognition.&nbsp;The more structured data we enrich content with, the better we will serve the transaction experience by readily providing information about prices, availability, reviews, videos, accessories, and other product details.GS1 Digital Link as only the Tip of the Iceberg called Product Knowledge Graph\u201cFor My Ally is the DATA, and a Powerful Ally It Is.\u201d&nbsp;Just like structured data became a thing for SEO with the introduction of Google\u2019s Knowledge Graph and gained popularity as more SEO professionals began helping&nbsp;online retailers leverage unique identifiers and structured data, these days another tool for greater visibility in search and quality traffic is on the way - the product knowledge graph. It is one way to approach structured data in a novel way from an SEO perspective.https://twitter.com/bill_slawski/status/1364064473342898178Put simply, a Product Knowledge Graph is an e-commerce specific form of knowledge graph built to improve product findability and end-user experiences by enriching a brand\u2019s content with data. Made of structured data and extended product markup, injected across both editorial and product content, a product knowledge graph is built on top of the product database to link all data together combining both structured information, (for instance, the list of products for a brand) or unstructured (for example the descriptions related to a collection of products).&nbsp;Structured DATA and GS1 Digital link can be part of this product knowledge graph, playing an important role in better customer experience and richer results.&nbsp;Structured data binds the data about products, brands, product categories, product features, reviews, hi-resolution images, shipping data, FAQs and a lot more. And GS1 Digital Link just serves as the portal to this ecosystem of product information. As a standard, it helps us bring the data (in the product knowledge graph) into the end user\u2019s hands.In the example below, you can see what a product knowledge graph can render in terms of rich results across a number of Google services.&nbsp;This pretty much is product-graph powered SEO - it is about enriching the content about an entity with a cluster of other entities and pages. We believe this is the&nbsp;Holy Grail of SEO.[et_bloom_locked optin_id=\"optin_8\"]  &gt;&gt;&gt; Get the Holy Grail of SEO &lt;&lt;&lt; [/et_bloom_locked]To use the table we used and the visual search scenarios, creating your own product knowledge graph is the other logical step. And it can be taken by using the GS1 Digital Link. And that is enriching the network of data with more connections - a structured data in your physical product code included.&nbsp;More on Product Graphs and Joe (the hyperconnected customer using them) is available here.WordLift can help you build your product knowledge graph. Let us show you how!Book a demo!GS1 Digital Link Quick Reference for Your Next ClientTo circle back to the coal mine metaphor (i.e. helping people find diamonds without dirtying themselves in the coal), SEO is all about finding ways to give readily structured precious pieces of data to search engines. And as&nbsp;SEO is turning to data graphs,&nbsp;(as Bill Slawski put it \u201cThe Web as a data is the new direction for SEO), the better the data, the more valuable diamonds.&nbsp;On the Web, better data means highly-connected data. And this is what SEO professionals have been doing - weave content, data and links together to connect the dots (actually, the nodes) for crawlers and ultimately get more sophisticated data to appear in search results.&nbsp;However, with the ever-increasing sophistication of search engines, the time has come to add another element to the SEO value proposition. The SEO community now is to communicate to potential and existing clients the mission-critical role of links between data to the talk about why keywords, content, relevancy matter and traffic.To help spread the word about the Web of data and SEO's role in it, we created this list as an executive summary for the client who needs more context for your next SEO move.What is structured data and what is GS1 Digital Link?Structured data is data that describes objects in a formal way. On the Web it is used to mark up pages, one of the most popular standard for markup being&nbsp;schema.org. In Plain English, it is this thing that makes types of snippets like review, recipe, video, and news article snippets appear when you search for something on the Web.&nbsp;Read Our Web Story.&nbsp;GS1 Digital Link provides the standards-based structure for the data about a product. GS1 Digital Link carries information such as expiration dates, nutritional and medical product data, warranty registration, troubleshooting instructions, even social media.&nbsp;In Plain English, this is a barcode that can carry tons of connected data.&nbsp;Read Our Article.&nbsp;How structured data and GS1 Digital Link benefit SEO?&nbsp;People scan, search, compare, look for all kinds of data on the Web. The more structured and granularly linked these data are, the more visible and easy to digest they are by people\u2019s (serch engines, apps, APIs and assistants - think Google, Alexa, Google Merchant centre)&nbsp;Give me the numbers [Gimme ROI]1.

And this what SEO has been about for many years now - finding the right balance between content, data, and links to make a business visible and easy to interact with to the right people. Yet, an unharnessed element in the field remains: the GS1 Digital link and the product knowledge graph. It is a challenging force to harness, yet we believe it is worth it for it brings more sophisticated results for users and more reusable (and valuable) data to clients.&nbsp;Remember, the diamonds.

        "text": "GraphSPARQL: A GraphQL interface for Linked Data If you are a developer, you probably have already worked with or heard about SEO (Search Engine Optimization). Nowadays, when optimizing websites for search engines, the focus is on annotating websites' content so that search engines can easily extract and \"understand\" the content. Annotating, in this case, is the representation of information presented on a website in a machine-understandable way by using a specific predefined structure. Noteworthy, the structure must be understood by the search engines. Therefore, in 2011 the four most prominent search engine providers Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!, and Yandex, founded Schema.org. Schema.org provides patterns for the information you might want to annotate on your websites, including some examples. Those examples allow web developers to get an idea of making the information on their website understandable by search engines.Knowledge GraphsBesides using the websites' annotations to provide more precise results to the users, search engines use them to build so-called Knowledge Graphs. Knowledge Graphs are huge semantic nets describing \"things\" and their connections between each other. Consider three \"things\", i.e. three hiking trails \"Auf dem Jakobsweg\", \"Lofer - Auer Wiesen - Maybergklamm\" and \"Wandergolfrunde St. Martin\" which are located in the region \"Salzburger Saalachtal\" (another \"thing\"). \"Salzburger Saalachtal\" is located in the state \"Salzburg,\" which is part of \"Austria.\" If we drew those connections on a sheet, we would end up with something that looks like the following.This is just a small extract of a Knowledge Graph, but it shows pretty well how things are connected with each other. Search engine providers collect data from a vast amount of websites and connect the data with each other. Not only search engine providers are doing so but even more companies are building Knowledge Graphs. Also, you can build a Knowledge Graph based on your annotations, as they are a good starting point. Now you might think that the amount of data is not sufficient for a Knowledge Graph. It is essential to mention that you can connect your data with other data sources, i.e., link your data or import data from external sources. There exists a vast Linked Open Data Cloud providing linked data sets of different categories. Linked in this case means that the different data sets are connected via certain relationships. Open implies that everyone can use it and import it into its own Knowledge Graph.An excellent use case for including data from the Linked Open Data Cloud is to integrate geodata. For example, as mentioned earlier, the Knowledge Graph should be built based on the annotations of hiking trails. Still, you don't have concrete data on the cities, regions, and countries. Then, you could integrate geodata from the Linked Open Data Cloud, providing detailed information on cities, regions, and countries.Over time, your Knowledge Graph will grow and become quite huge and even more powerful due to all the connections between the different \"things.\"Sounds great, but how can I use the data in the Knowledge Graph?Unfortunately, this is where a huge problem arises. For querying the Knowledge Graph, it is necessary to write so-called SPARQL queries, a standard for querying Knowledge Graphs. SPARQL is challenging to use if you are not familiar with the syntax and has a steep learning curve. Especially, if you are not into the particular area of Semantic Web Technologies. In that case, you may not want to learn such a complex query language that is not used anywhere else in your daily developer life. However, SPARQL is necessary for publishing and accessing Linked Data on the Web. But there is hope. We would not write this blog post if we did not have a solution to overcome this gap. We want to give you the possibility, on the one hand, to use the strength of Knowledge Graphs for storing and linking your data, including the integration of external data, and on the other hand, a simple query language for accessing the \"knowledge\" stored. The \"knowledge\" can then be used to power different kinds of applications, e.g., intelligent personal assistants. Now you have been tortured long enough. We will describe a simple middleware that allows you to query Knowledge Graphs by using the simple syntax of GraphQL queries.What is GraphQL?GraphQL is an open standard published in 2015, initially invented by Facebook. Its primary purpose is to be a flexible and developer-friendly alternative to REST APIs. Before GraphQL, developers had to use API results as predefined by the API provider even if only one value was required by the user of the API. GraphQL allows specifying a GraphQL query in a way that only the relevant data is fetched. Additionally, the JSON syntax of GraphQL makes it easy to use. Nearly every programming language has a JSON parser, and developers are familiar with representing data using JSON syntax. The simplicity and ease of use also gained interest in the Semantic Web Community as an alternative for querying RDF data. Graph database (used to store Knowledge Graphs) providers like Ontotex (GraphDB) and Stardog introduced GraphQL as an alternative query language for their databases. Unfortunately, those databases can not be exchanged easily due to the different kinds of GraphQL schemas they require. The GraphQL schema defines which information can be queried. Each of the database providers has its own way of providing this schema.Additionally, the syntax of the GraphQL queries supported by the database providers differs due to special optimizations and extensions. Another problem is that there are still many services available on the Web that are only accessible via SPARQL. How can we overcome all this hassle and reach a simple solution applicable to arbitrary SPARQL endpoints?GraphSPARQLAll those problems led to a conceptualization and implementation of a middleware transforming GraphQL into SPARQL queries called GraphSPARQL. As part of the R&amp;D work that we are doing, in the context of the EU-cofounded project called WordLift Next Generation , three students from the University Innsbruck developed GraphSPARQL in the course of a Semantic Web Seminar.Let us consider the example of a query that results in a list of persons' names to illustrate the functionality of GraphSPARQL. First, the user needs to provide an Enriched GraphQL Schema, in principle defining the information that should be queryable by GraphSPARQL. This schema is essential for the mapping between the GraphQL query and the SPARQL query.The following figure shows the process of an incoming query and transforming it to a SPARQL query. If you want to query for persons with their names, the GraphQL query shown on the left side of the figure will be used. This query is processed inside GraphSPARQL by a so-called Parser. The Parser uses the predefined schema to transform the GraphQL query into the SPARQL query. This SPARQL query is then processed by the Query Processor. It handles the connection to the Knowledge Graph. On the right side of the figure, you see the SPARQL query generated based on the GraphQL query. It is pretty confusing compared to the simple GraphQL query. Therefore, we want to hide those queries with our middleware.As a result of the SPARQL query, the Knowledge Graph responds with something that seems quite cryptic, if you are not familiar with the syntax. You can see an example SPARQL response on the following figure's right side. This cryptic response is returned to the Parser by the Query Processor. The Parser then, again with the help of the schema, transforms the response into a nice-looking GraphQL response. The result is a JSON containing the result of the initial query.GraphSPARQL provides you easy access to the information stored in a Knowledge Graph using the simple GraphQL query language.You have a Knowledge Graph stored in a graph database that is accessible via SPARQL endpoint only? Then GraphSPARQL is the perfect solution for you. Before you can start, you need to follow two configuration steps:Provide the so-called Enriched GraphQL Schema. This schema can either be created automatically based on a given ontology, e.g., schema.org provides its ontology as a download or can be defined manually. An example for both cases can be found on the GraphSPARQL Github page in the example folder:- automatic creation of a schema based on the DBPedia ontology- manually defined schemaDefine the SPARQL endpoint GraphSPARQL should connect to. This can be done in the configuration file (see \"config.json\" in the example folder).Have you done both preparation steps? Perfect, now you are ready to use GraphSPARQL on the endpoint you defined. Check the end of the blog post if you are interested in a concrete example.Summary- What are the benefits of GraphSPARQL?- Benefit from Knowledge Graphs by using a simple query language- Simple JSON syntax for defining queries- Parser support for the JSON syntax of GraphQL queries in nearly all programming languages- GraphQL query structure represents the structure of the expected result- Restrict data access via the provided GraphQL schemaGraphSPARQL as middleware allows querying SPARQL endpoints using GraphQL as a simple query language and is an important step to open Semantic Web Technologies to a broader audience.ExampleDocker container to test GraphSPARQL:Two options to start the docker container are supported so far:Use predefined configuration for DBPedia: start the GraphSPARQL docker container docker run -d -p 80:80 kev09ang/graph_sparql Customized configuration:Go to https://github.com/Meitinger/GraphSPARQLCheck the example folder for config files, ontologies (dbpedia.owl) and schemas (sample1.json)Create locally a file named `config.json` linking to an ontology or a schemaStart the docker container by mounting the folder containing your custom configuration:docker run -d -p 80:80 -v :/App/configuration kev09ang/graph_sparqlOpen your web browser and open http://localhost/ui/graphiqlEnter the following query to retrieve information on the state of Salzburg in AustriaqueryadministrativeRegion(filter:\"?label ='Salzburg (state)'@en\"){idlabel (filter:\"lang(?) ='en'\")abstract (filter:\"lang(?) ='en'\")country {label (filter:\"lang(?) ='en'\")abstract (filter:\"lang(?_) ='en'\")}populationTotal}}If you want to know which other fields you can query, use the `_fields` command, e.g.:JSONquery {_fields}as a response you get a list of fields you can use for your GraphQL query:{  \"data\": {    \"_fields\": &#91;      \"_fields\",      \"abbey\",      \"academicJournal\",      \"activity\",      \"actor\",      \"administrativeRegion\",      \"adultActor\",      \"agent\",      ...    ]  }}Want to know more about WordLift NG?Click here[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

How to buy WooCommerce SEO by WordLiftWhat is schema markup?As you probably know, for a few years now, Google no longer reasons by keywords, but by concepts (entities). Therefore, when a user types \"sweatshirt\" in the search bar, Google doesn't just scan the pages of all the websites in the world that mention the word sweatshirt.&nbsp;The search engine is in fact able to understand that you are looking for a sweatshirt to buy, a product. Consequently, Google will report in the results page all the products that can be assimilated to a sweatshirt: real sweatshirts, but maybe also tracksuits, or store pages in other languages that talk about hoodies or sweatshirts.Now let's change the point of view. Let's say you are the owner of an e-commerce clothing store that sells sweatshirts.What can you do to get your products to show up on Google in a good position?Well, surely you can stand by and hope that Google scans your site correctly and brands your sweatshirts as products, reporting all the features of the garments as well.......or you can talk to Google in their language, and be sure that the search engine understands all the information about your products perfectly!&nbsp;That's exactly where schema markup comes in. Schema markup, in fact, is nothing but the language that Google speaks, its natural language. \u201cGooglese\u201d, if you will ?Through schema markup and structured data, you can communicate directly with Google and be sure that the search engine identifies and classifies your store information in the right way.&nbsp;And when Google really understands what a page is about, you know what it does? It tends to put it more prominently in the SERP... but more on that in a moment.What are the benefits of schema markup for your WooCommerce site?&nbsp;Implementing schema markup on your WordPress e-commerce site can bring several benefits to your virtual store:1. Have your products appear on Google ProductsYou know those boxes that appear on the results page when you search for a product?Yes, we are talking about these \u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f.These are previews of Google Products, or more accurately, products featured on Google Merchant Center. In some SERPs this position may be occupied by paid ads, but organic results may end up there as well (to be fair, sometimes organic results are marked as ads).Wondering how it's possible to make your product appear there as well?&nbsp;Well, you have several options for doing so.You can go to Google Merchant Center, open an account, configure it and then upload a product feed. The feed of Merchant Center must of course follow very precise criteria and remain continuously updated, so you'd better get it through a special software (for a fee).Time spent on this operation? A lot!The alternative is to put schema markup directly on your web pages so that Google can read them and get all the information it needs to list the products in Google Products.Of course, you can manually insert them into your WooCommerce schema markup , but you'll have to work on the code and invest many hours of work. Or you could leave it to our plugin, which automatically detects all attributes of your products and generates a markup just as Google likes it ? .Remember, however, that schema markup acts deep down, at the code level, so you won't need to work on the front end of your site (and get the web designer to work again). Your pages will maintain exactly the same look. The signals for Google will be there, but absolutely invisible to the visitor\u2019s eye.2. Rich snippets of your product pages (and editorial content)&nbsp;One of the main benefits of using schema markup is that your products can appear in Google's SERP with a rich snippet.The rich snippet is the pro version of the classic snippet: a rich and comprehensive preview that makes your result more communicative, and therefore more attractive to users.Want an example? Check out the two previews below. Which one do you feel most like clicking on?To be more precise, if you implement structured data your product pages will be able to appear on Google enriched with this information:reviews;offerings;brand;color;price;image;availability;info on shipping and delivery;Product-related FAQs.In addition to the attributes that we have listed and that are shown on the SERP, there is another very important piece of information that you can communicate to Google: the product ID. We'll talk about that later, though.The last important thing you need to know about structured data is that it can also be used to enrich your editorial content. You could, for example, mark the various paragraphs of your blog article as FAQs so that it appears as a rich result on SERPs. So \u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0fOr you can use schema markup to better link your content to your product pages. How? We explain it below .3. More traffic and improved organic rankingLet's just say it: officially Google does not recognize the use of schema markup among the ranking factors. But even though structured data doesn't directly affect ranking, we can confidently say that it helps increase organic traffic.Think about it. If your products appear as tabs in SERPs, won't they generate more clicks? And isn't CTR a ranking factor? ?The same goes for rich results. A wider, more complete and richer snippet is much more attractive than a classic snippet. The result? More clicks, more CTR, increased positions in SERP, and then even more clicks and more visits...Finally, let's talk about content. If you can make your content more interesting, improve the user experience and increase the time of users on the site, Google notices. And it rewards you by making you gain positions on the results page.&nbsp;In the end, it's not just your product pages that will benefit from the implementation of schema markup, your entire store SEO strategy (including your content marketing strategy) will become much, much more effective.[et_bloom_locked optin_id=\"optin_9\"] &gt;&gt;&gt; Get your checklst &lt;&lt;&lt; [/et_bloom_locked]Does schema markup increase your e-commerce sales?Let's put it this way: SEO is the art of attracting users who are already interested in the solutions you offer. That's why traffic coming from organic search is generally the highest quality and the one that performs best in terms of conversions, and therefore, sales.&nbsp;The only other source of traffic that has a comparable performance to organic traffic is perhaps Google ADS, but we all know how expensive a paid ad campaign can be.&nbsp;So imagine if all those additional visitors came to your site for free instead of a euro per click ... what would it mean for your sales, and for your earnings?The fundamental structured data for an e-commerce siteNow that you understand all the advantages you get with schema markup, let's get down to the nitty gritty. We\u2019re talking about the four fundamental markup types for an e-commerce site: product, organization, article, and FAQ.Let's look at them together.Product Markup&nbsp;With the standard markup of WooCommerce product pages you can communicate to Google a series of essential data for your customers: product description, image, price, availability, conditions, and user ratings.&nbsp;Using our plugin you can get even more, making information about the brand, the color and the condition of your products (new, used, reconditioned etc) appear in the rich snippet as well. The result in SERP will be similar to this:Also, by inserting the Product markup, you can have your product appear in Google Shopping tabs.&nbsp;Organization Markup Organization markup allows you to communicate information about your store to Google.&nbsp;It could be particularly useful to use this structured data, for example, if you have both a virtual store and physical stores, perhaps already well positioned in the local area. In this case the search engine could create an immediate association between the two channels (and this, trust me, is not trivial).In general, however, Organization markup allows your company to appear more fully in the SERP by generating a Knowledge Panel. So \u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f&nbsp;Article Markup Article markup is really useful for making your content marketing strategy more effective. Speaking in Googlese, you can declare to the search engine exactly what products you refer to in your content, but you can also be absolutely precise about the brands you deal with and the details of your organization.In short, you can rest assured that you'll communicate via a direct line with Google, with no possibility of misunderstandings.FAQ Markup This is one of the most interesting possibilities offered by schema markup.In fact, you can add FAQ markup to both your content pages and your product pages. The snippet of your pages in SERPs will then become much larger and much more informative.This is what I mean \u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0fUseful, right?[et_pb_section global_module=\"20965\"][/et_pb_section]How to implement schema markup on WooCommerceTo implement schema markup on WooCommerce you have two options:add schema markup manually, by intervening in the codeuse a plugin that automatically collects product attributes and \"translates\" them into schema.org.This is exactly what WooCommerce SEO by WordLift does!Once installed, our plugin automatically transforms your product sheets into product entities with all their attributes.In addition, E-commerce SEO lets you use structured data to enrich articles and static pages, creating links to product pages or adding FAQs and information about your organization.&nbsp;How much markup can you do automatically, without human intervention?As we said before, our plugin does everything by itself (or almost).&nbsp;As soon as it's activated, WooCommerce SEO by WordLift automatically obtains all the attributes of your products and implements them in the schema markup language. You, of course, will always have the possibility to intervene to refine and modify the cards, adding for example the color of the items, the brand, the condition and the product identification code.Things change when we talk about your WooCommerce content (articles, static pages). In this case you'll be the one to create the link with the products to make Google recognize what you're talking about, and you'll be the one to add Organization markup and FAQ markup in both product and content pages through a friendly and easy to use interface.&nbsp;The process, however, is super simple. Watch the explanation video or keep reading to understand it better!Add the most important product attributes via schema markupNow let's see step by step how to insert product page attributes with WooCommerce SEO by WordLift.Website&nbsp;This section is very useful if you are a reseller of products created by others. Here you can actually whisper to Google where to go to retrieve more information about your product... simply by entering the link to the manufacturer's official page!Like almost all data entered with schema markup, the reference will not appear on the front end of your site.&nbsp;Item conditionHere you can specify the status of your product: new, used, reconditioned...BrandIn this section you can associate your product to a brand. Of course, if you are also the producer of the items for sale, you can mark the product as yours.ColorHere you can indicate the color of the product for sale.Is related to...Here you can report products, services, or product-related collections.Product IdentifierThis is the area where you can enter the unique identification code of your product, an alphanumeric series extremely important for SEO. In the next paragraph, we'll explain what this is all about.Once you've completed these fields, you're done! Just click on the update button and your product page will immediately have all the schema markup attributes.Please note that the design of your page does not change when you implement structured data: all information is passed directly into the code.Product ID codes: why are they so important for SEO?Have you ever tried to Google a replacement part for your car, your vacuum cleaner or your coffee machine?And how did it go? It wasn't easy to compare the various offerings, was it?This example is perfect for explaining what the product ID code is for.The product identification code is an alphanumeric series used to describe and uniquely identify a certain product (and therefore a certain model, even of a certain color) all over the world. It\u2019s like the identity card of the products!Existing encoding standards vary; Google accepts MPN, EAN and GTIN. The latter is probably the most comprehensive encoding, which also incorporates other international standards such as ISBN, the encoding of book products.However, the biggest advantage of the identification code is that it is absolutely unique. With this code a specific product can always be identified along the entire production and distribution chain, from Italy to Australia.But now let's understand how this alphanumeric combination can help your e-commerce SEO.If you associate your products with a unique code, such as a GTIN, Google and other marketplaces will be able to recognize precisely which product it is. As a result, it will be much easier for the search engine to match your product to other retailers and make your product sheets appear correctly on the results page when potential customers perform a search.In other words, with GTIN you help make your customers' search experience smoother and more immediate... and, as a result, likely increase your e-commerce sales.Obviously, not all types of products have an identification code: if you sell handicraft products, for example, you will certainly not have a related code. At the same time, practically all industrial products are associated with a unique code, which you can usually find in the documentation.How to add product markup in your articles, static pages and everywhere on WorPpressSo far, we've talked mainly about how to mark up product pages to make them better interpreted by Google. Now we're going to see how schema markup can help us improve users' interaction with our e-commerce site through more in-depth visits and guided paths starting from contents and arriving at products.(And remember! Depth and quality of user experience are metrics that Google uses to determine content rankings.)With WooCommerce SEO by WordLift you can quickly create links between your textual content and product sheets. All you need to do is:select the word or phrase you are interested inswitch to the WordLift tab on the editorassociate the selected expression with one of your productsUpon scrolling the mouse, visitors will immediately see the Product Context Card, a preview with all the most important data of the product card you linked to.But that's not all! Our plugin allows you to automatically add a selection of related products to all your content pages. Don't worry, we'll look at this soon ;)How to check schema markup with Google Rich Results TestOnce you've entered structured data about your product pages, you can test your work with Google's Rich Results Test tool.&nbsp;(If you're using E-commerce SEO by WordLift, just click the \u201cTest Google Rich Snippet\u201d button).The tool provided by Google will scan the structured data of your page and report what has been entered correctly or where there may be errors.How to monitor rich results in Search ConsoleAfter you've tagged your site's pages with structured data, you can go check in Search Console to see how your \"rich\" content appears on Google.To do so, simply click on Performance &gt; Search Appearance and check the performance of the different page types.If you've inserted product page markup, for example, you'll see a result like this:Clicking on the item you're interested in will also allow you to drill down further into the analysis, such as understanding which queries the views and clicks are coming from.This section of the Search Console can also be useful for the content marketing strategy of your e-commerce business. In fact, if you enter the correct markup, here you will see which type of content performs better in terms of search: articles, videos, FAQ pages, etc.&nbsp;In other words, this tool helps you identify growth trends in content consumption and make important decisions for your editorial plan.Add related products to your WordPress pagesIn WordPress articles, pages and other text spaces (even on the product page) you can add the Product Navigator, a block that intelligently selects related products.What does intelligently mean? Take this as an example:Let's say you write an article about the various types of jeans and set up links to your product pages with the Context Card tool. Product Navigator is able to detect the links on the page and automatically create a gallery that links to the products mentioned.The result looks like this \u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0fConvenient, isn't it? What's more, inserting Product Navigator is super easy. We explain how to do it step by step in this video.How to buy WooCommerce SEO by WordLiftWooCommerce SEO by WordLift is available exclusively on the official WooCommerce marketplace.By purchasing it you activate an annual subscription of $79, which includes one year of remote support and all system updates.The subscription includes all features of the plugin, namely:Structured Data Editor for your product pagesProduct Context Card to connect your editorial content with your product pagesProduct Navigator for related productsBasically you get 3 plugins for the price of 1!Don't miss this opportunity to gain more organic traffic and improve your website's user experience.We'll be waiting for you on the other side ?Automate structured data markup on your WooCommerce siteGet WooCommerce SEO by WordLift[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

You can find the other posts here:The Power of Product Knowledge Graph for E-commerceTouch your SEO: Introducing Physical SEOThe GS1 Digital Link explained for SEO Jedis (and their clients)These days customer journeys are paved with data points. From an omnichannel marketing perspective, this means that a significant part of success in strategies to engage people is related to not only having well-aligned content across channels, devices and places but also to publishing well-managed, standardized, meaningful data. In other words, if we start looking behind the scenes of every touch point, we will see that there lie multiple data pieces waiting for us to&nbsp;meaningfully connect them and give our customers what they want: a great user experience.In this post, we explain:How can structured, meaningful data bring value to marketingHow standard data helps you engage your customer (spoiler: by feeding their machine assistants with machine-readable content)How to make the most of your cardboard robot in your next creative brief.

As a recent Think with Google report&nbsp;Decoding Decisions Making sense of the messy middle&nbsp;conveyed:\u201cThe \u2018messy middle\u2019, a space of abundant information and unlimited choice that shoppers have learned to manage using a range of cognitive shortcuts.\u201dAs you can see, there is a disappearance of boundaries when it comes to people engaging with brands. This is also true when it comes to their shopping experiences. When someone searches for a product, they \u201cfreely gather information from online and offline sources such as web searches, social media, app-based information delivery, traditional media, showrooms, and brick-and-mortar stores. \u201c (read more in:&nbsp;Operations in an Omnichannel World). Something more, these purchase decisions are being executed through multiple channels: an app, on a website, at a retail store, through a smart speaker, you name it.&nbsp;As you might have already guessed, behind these touch points and points of sale, there lie data points.&nbsp;Again, customer journeys are paved with data points. That said, the answer to the question \u201cHow to differentiate in an overcrowded world of value propositions\u201d might well lie outside it.&nbsp;In the world of data.&nbsp;Quick Brief on the Value of Data as a Marketing Means\u201cAnyone who shops online knows how difficult and frustrating it can be to refine a search and explore for items at the same time.\u201d [cit.&nbsp;Cracking the Code on Conversational Commerce&nbsp;]Yesterday I met my neighbour in the elevator and complimented her on her bag. \u201cFendy\", she said and took it off to show it to me. &nbsp;Now imagine me, having fallen in love with this bag, trying to make my way around the streams of data pouring over me. How do I find it online? I would probably do a search and hope to find it in the image results, which would have brought me to thousands of results, none of which owned by Fendi:Alternatively, I would find Fendi\u2019s website, try their website search, and then try to refine, using various facets and terminology the brand uses, which I am not totally understanding.With lots of matches found, my enthusiasm would slowly fade away.I would be in the position of seeing for myself \u201chow difficult and frustrating it can be to refine a search and explore for items at the same time.\u201d,&nbsp;as Ebay\u2019s CEO rightfully highlighted back in&nbsp;2017&nbsp;in&nbsp;Cracking the Code on Conversational Commerce.Brands can do better, though.

Fendi was smart enough to take advantage of the Web of Data and had their GS1 Digital link (long story short,&nbsp;a barcode connecting products to information on the Web) carry information about the bag that are readily available on the Web, structured and interlinked.So, in this parallel universe of omnichannel marketing married to SEO and semantic technologies, I scan the bag and I immediately get a handful of features and information about them. In addition, I get related products, similar recommended items, prices and availability.Who could ask for anything more?And before you ran away, first because you might have thought this could never happen to your brand, and next because of hearing \u201cdata\u201d and \u201cGS what?\u201d, you thought this has nothing to do with an omnichannel strategy and tactics, bear with me one more paragraph.Here\u2019s the gist of the solution to that frustration: to make your customers\u2019 experiences empowering rather than frustrating, your marketing efforts should take into account a closely related to your customers\u2019 experience aspect of your content, and that is - data. Your product information has data behind it; even your editorial content can be annotated with data in ways that would allow people to navigate and search this content easily.And this is why it\u2019s high time digital marketing, e-commerce and omnichannel shake hands and enter the world of data. And this entrance doesn\u2019t have to be hard and overwhelming.Here\u2019s a pleasant one.Please, meet Jason!Meet Jason - your algorithmic user you might not have been thinking about lately.In our previous post, we introduced Joe, the social customer struggling to connect the dots of your e-commerce content. As we saw,&nbsp;Joe has to jump across multiple sites, check for inventory, product availability, delivery, details. In a nutshell, Joe did all the leg work which, as you will see, we, as digital marketers, could have saved him.How?By attending to the&nbsp;Linked Data&nbsp;aspect of Joe\u2019s journey.&nbsp;To see that aspect in a clearer way, we invite you to learn more about Jason - Joe\u2019s algorithmic assistant.&nbsp;Jason is the name of a fictional algorithmic persona we created. He is not the terminator we are all afraid of, but a regular machine trying to fetch content back and forth.&nbsp;In brief, Jason wants to read all the data about your product and serve meaningful results to Joe. Yet, Jason is struggling to understand how a blog post about your product is related to the product features of that same product and also to the need Joe has.Defined by this function, his needs and wants are not much of a mystery. He wants to read data and be able to connect it in a meaningful way. Yet, this frustrates him (to use the common persona identification \u201cfrustrations\u201d). On the one hand, he cannot unify it into a meaningful result for Joe! Jason is struggling to make sense of data that are related yet not connected for Jason! Another challenge for Jason is Interoperability. Jason cannot read and integrate all the different data formats across the Web. As you can see, Jason is in trouble.Your Algorithmic Persona: Goals, Frustrations and How to Please It.To make things clearer, we worked with Dominik Berger, Head of Growth at Digital Samba to&nbsp;help&nbsp;you better understand the importance of the Linked Data aspect of the omnichannel world.&nbsp;Linked Data is important for it enables data from different sources to be connected and queried. Meaning, it can solve most of the frustrations Jason has when typing to accomplish various goals.Jason\u2019s Goals:Help you find the right product [on the aisle, in search]Answer a questionFind the shortest path to be efficient&nbsp;Understand your context&nbsp;Personalize your resultsTailor everything they do to you&nbsp;Know you. Remember your choices&nbsp;Make things easier for youAnd from these goals stem his frustrations.Jason\u2019s Frustrations:Lack of access to standardized data&nbsp;Doesn\u2019t always understand natural languageDoesn\u2019t always correctly understand imagesHard for him to understand context, the human condition in general [Why we don\u2019t take the shortest way]Faced with insufficient Data&nbsp;Noisy environmentConstantly looking for validation&nbsp;Limited resources, in terms of computer powerTo most of these data frustrations, there is a Linked Data solution, which has the potential to further be translated into an engaging omnichannel experience.Frustrations&nbsp;Linked Data solutionsThe Marketing BenefitLack of access to standardized data&nbsp;Linked Data builds upon standard Web technologies such as HTTP and URIs, but rather than using them to serve web pages for human readers, it extends them to share information in a way that can be read automatically by computers.Annotated with Linked Data product information becomes easily accessible to Jason and other algorithmic audiences (e.g. Google, an app)Increased transparency for consumers and lower costs of data reuse by the marketing teams working for the point of sale (POS).Doesn\u2019t understand natural languageUsing linked data, statements are encoded in triples that can be computed. The meaning of a text is translated into subject-predicate-object constructs. This means that when we have for example a product copy, we can annotate it in a way that would make sense to Jason.Immediate access to product data&nbsp;and also use the Knowledge Graph to validate the semantic accuracy of textual content (human validation will otherwise fail in scaling).&nbsp;&nbsp;Doesn\u2019t understand imagesWe can link images to products using GTIN and other unique product identifiers (UPI). We can also use structured linked data to show the preferred licensing policy for the images used on the product.&nbsp;A richer and improved omnichannel experience. With higher-quality and more-consistent licensed images.&nbsp;Hard for him to understand contextLinked data allow us to use persistent identi\ufb01ers to uniquely identify products and attributes. With these identifiers (Linked Data URI) and structured data, we can connect all product\u2019s related information resources from different web pages or even different web sites.&nbsp;By combining product information and additional resources such as videos, reviews, how-tos and FAQs consumers, at the POS are able to search and evaluate products more easily, make better decisions, and trust retailers and brands even more.Faced with insufficient data&nbsp;Linked Data offers smoother interoperability between different data sets and facilitates data reuse, thus enabling a broader context.As more data is made available and linked directly from the physical product with GS1 Digital link, we can free resources from the omnichannel marketing team so that they focus on what matters more\u2014building engaging consumer experiences in the physical stores.Noisy environment (noisy data)According to W3C, RDF has features that facilitate data merging even if the underlying schemas differ, and it specifically supports the evolution of schemas over time without requiring all the data consumers to be changed\u201d. This means also being able to programmatically validate data coming from different sources about the same item. Instead of publishing data in all kinds of formats, we can publish standardized data and remove the noise for Jason.Establishing interoperable standards for data exchange enables more timely, accurate, and consistent relationships between brand owners and retailers. It also allows more advanced analytics and better marketing validation processes.&nbsp;Scarcity: Limited resources, in terms of computer power&nbsp; [limited budget]Higher-quality and standardized product data can be shared across the entire value chain. And this is what can save unnecessary IT operations.&nbsp;Brand owners and retailers spend time, resources (also precious environmental resources like energy) and money to manage product data. Different retailers require data from brand owners in a wide range of formats. This typically requires thousands of hours of labour that otherwise can be allocated to improve the shopper experience.&nbsp;Redefining In-Store ExperiencesA nifty definition of a QR code is that \u201cIt is a pull mechanism for already-interested consumers to find out more and engage with the brand, rather than a push communication to the mass-market. (Read more in:&nbsp;Exploring Omnichannel Retailing Common Expectations and Diverse Realities&nbsp;)&nbsp;Now take this and add the Web to this same \u201cpull mechanism\u201d. What you get is a powerful tool to bridge consumer experiences. We wrote about&nbsp;GS1 Digital Link&nbsp;before but to stick to seeing beyond the technicalities, let\u2019s look at the sea-change data brings to omnichannel strategies. By providing the tools for meaningful on and off the Web customer experiences, we can add value for people and enable engaging physical and digital encounters with the brand.To get back to the story with my neighbour, here\u2019s the future we as marketing professionals can build.

Ensure that your scholarly content is always crawled by search engines.Make sure that the URL of every article is reachable from the homepage by following at most ten simple HTML links.Your website must make either the full text of the articles or their complete author-written abstracts freely available and easy to see when users click on your URLs in Google search results.Your website must not require users (or search robots) to sign inYour website must not require users (or search robots) to sign in, install special software, accept disclaimers, dismiss popup or interstitial advertisements, click on links or buttons, or scroll down the page before they can read the entire abstract of the paper.Optimize your scholarly papers for Google ScholarEnsure that the content hosted on your website consists primarily of scholarly articles - journal papers, conference papers, technical reports, or their drafts, dissertations, pre-prints, post-prints, or abstracts. Content such as news or magazine articles, book reviews, and editorials is not appropriate for Google Scholar.&nbsp;Documents larger than 5MB, such as books and long dissertations, should be uploaded to Google Book Search; Google Scholar automatically includes scholarly works from Google Book Search.The full text of your paper is in a PDF file that ends with \".pdf\"The title of the paper appears in a large font on top of the first pageThe authors of the paper are listed right below the title on a separate lineThere's a bibliography section titled, e.g., \"References\" or \"Bibliography\" at the endYour files need to be either in HTML or PDF format. PDF files must have searchable text, i.e., you must be able to search for and find words in the document using Adobe Acrobat Reader.Use structured data by adding scholarly article schema markupThis is my favorite tool to rank in Google Scholar. It\u2019s a very powerful way to communicate your scholarly content for the search engine using structured data.Structured data can come in a few different forms. At its base level, structured data is a process of marking up your website so search engines can quickly crawl your page.When you markup your page, you specify exactly what kind of content will be on that page, and any specifics that go along with that content so it will be useful for:Helping search engine gain confidenceBuild your own knowledge graph&nbsp;Improve linking data on your websiteWhat does ScholarlyArticle markup look like?Here I want to share with you some of the optimizations I applied on The&nbsp;Arab&nbsp;Media &amp; Society&nbsp;website.Arab Media &amp; Society&nbsp;is a primary resource for media research. The journal, published biannually online and in print, offers peer-reviewed scholarly research and analysis on a wide array of topics pertaining to the dynamic media landscape across the Arab world.Problem:Their traffic from Google Scholar was very limited even if the number of scholarly papers was high.Solution:Resolving crawl issuesOptimize PDFs title, captures, and descriptions for all PapersApply ScholarlyArticle Markup for all papersImprove E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) by creating person entities for authors and linked to their knowledge graphResults:In the first month after applying all the optimizations we notice a 61% organic traffic increase from Google Scholar.here is a example of how ScholarlyArticle looks like on on of the scholarly papers of this site:Improve E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)E\u2011A-T- stands for expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness. It comes from Google\u2019s Search Quality Rater Guidelines. So why is having expertise, authority, and trust so significant?Essentially, E-A-T determines a website\u2019s value.&nbsp;Quality raters keep E-A-T in mind when judging how good a site or page provides what they need. They look to see if they\u2019re getting a good online experience and if the content meets their standards. If the raters feel like a user would feel comfortable reading, sharing, and recommending the content, that earns the site a high level of E-A-T.Consider E-A-T the reason why customers would choose your site over your competition. E-A-T could immediately affect how Google sees your site.Structured data helps establish and solidify the relationship between entities, Using structured data to establish these relationships can streamline Google\u2019s ability to assess the E-A-T of a given page, website, or entity, because it can help:Structured data builds up the connection between entities, and this will help Google better understand the data behind and improve E-A-T.Without confidence about what entities are included on a page, it could be difficult for search engines to accurately assess the expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness of those entities.How to Improve E-A-T for Google Scholar?Create a Person Entity for each authorEnrich the Person Entity by adding some extra information related to the website of the author, official page, LinkedIn Profile, Social .. etc .. This will make it much easier for the search engine to collect all the information about the author and trust your siteConnect all the articles related to a specific author with its Person EntityWhat does Person markup look like?here is an example for the Person Entity for the author if the  Scholarly Article markup mentioned previously on this article.",

        "text": "Finding Similar Entities across Knowledge Graphs With the rise of knowledge graphs (KGs), interlinking KGs has attracted a lot of attention.Finding similar entities among KGs plays an essential role in knowledge integration and KG connection. It can help end-users and search engines more effectively and easily access pertinent information across KGs.In this blog post, we introduce a new research paper and the approach that we are experimenting with within the context of Long-tail SEO.Long-tail SEOOne of the goals that we have for WordLift NG is to create the technology required for helping editors go after long-tail search intents. Long-tail queries are search terms that tend to have lower search volume and competition rate, as well as a higher conversion rate. Let me give you an example: \u201cski touring\u201d is a query that we can intercept with a page like this one (or with a similar page). Our goal is twofold:helping the team at SalzburgerLand Tourismus (the use-case partner of our project) expand on their existing positioning on Google by supporting them in finding long-tail queries;helping them enrich their existing website with content that matches that long-tail query and that can rank on Google.In order to facilitate the creation of new content we proceed as follows:analyze the entities behind the top results that Google proposes (in a given country and language) for a given query.find a match with similar entities on the local KG of the client.To achieve the first objective WordLift has created an API (called long-tail) that will analyze the top results and extract a short summary as well as the main entities behind each of the first results.Now given a query entity in one KG (let\u2019s say DBpedia), we intend to propose an approach to find the most similar entity in another KG (the graph created by WordLift on the client\u2019s website) as illustrated in Figure 1.Figure 1.&nbsp; The interlinking problem over the knowledge graphsThe main idea is to leverage graph embedding, clustering, regression and sentence embedding as shown in Figure 2.Figure 2. The proposed approachIn our proposed approach, RDF2Vec technique has been employed to generate vector representations of all entities of the second KG and then the vectors have been clustered based on cosine similarity using K medoids algorithm. Then, an artificial neural network with multilayer perceptron topology has been used as a regression model to predict the corresponding vector in the second knowledge graph for a given vector from the first knowledge graph. After determining the cluster of the predicated vector, the entities of the detected cluster are ranked through the sentence-BERT method and finally, the entity with the highest rank is chosen as the most similar one. If you are interested in our work, we strongly recommend you to read the published paper.Conclusions and future workTo sum up, the proposed approach to find the most similar entity from a local KG with a given entity from another KG, includes four steps: graph embedding, clustering, regression and ranking. In order to evaluate the approach presented, the DBPedia and SalzburgerLand KGs have been used as the KGs and the available entity pairs which have the same relation, have been considered as training data to train the regression models. The absolute error (MAE), R squared (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) have been applied to measure the performance of the regression model. In the next step, we will show how the proposed approach leads to enriching the SalzburgerLand website when it takes the main entities from the long-tail API and finds the most similar entities in the SalzburgerLand KG.Reference to the paper with full details: Aghaei, S., Fensel, A. \u201eFinding Similar Entities Across Knowledge Graphs\u201c, in Proceedings of the 7th International Conference on Advances in Computer Science and Information Technology (ACSTY 2021), Volume Editors: David C.

        "text": "WooCommerce Product Pages: 5 SEO Tips to Increase Your Sales Why it is important to Have an Effective WooCommerce Product Page5 Elements Your Effective WooCommerce Product Page Must Have\u00a0Write A Great Product DescriptionChoose Quality Images And VideosInclude Ratings &amp; ReviewsIncorporate a FAQ section\u00a0Add Product SuggestionsWhy Structured Data Is Important If You Want Your Product Page To Stand Out From The OthersYour WooCommerce Product Pages Best AllWooCommerce SEO by WordLift Features overviewWhy it is important to Have an Effective WooCommerce Product PageStatistas\u2019 data predicts that by 2021 over 4 billion people worldwide will purchase goods and services online; so currently the number of digital shoppers is continuing to increase steadily as well as the e-commerce sales that will amount to over 6 billion US dollars in 2024.&nbsp;At the same time, this increase in demand has caused a boost in competition, and we can observe a decrease in conversion. In fact, Statista shows that the average website conversion rate has decreased from 3.23% in 2018 to 2.17% in 2020.If we look more closely at product pages, a research from Invespcro finds that they have an average effectiveness rate of 10.4%. In other words, 1 out of every 10 people that visit a product page will add the product to their cart.For this reason, you should not settle for anything lower than this benchmark. So, here's what you can do to optimize your WooCommerce product pages and get more sales and customers.&nbsp;5 Elements Your Effective WooCommerce Product Page Must Have&nbsp;The product page is one of the most important pages on your website. Learning how to create an effective product page will help give your target customers the information they need and convert browsers into buyers. We are going to show you how to customize your WooCommerce Product Page in order to generate more effectiveness and success.&nbsp;Write A Great Product Description&nbsp;The description is a fundamental element of any product page: people need to have a perfect understanding of what they are buying. For this reason, the narrative should be clear, encompassing all necessary information that will assist shoppers in making their purchasing decision.&nbsp;Furthermore, the advantage of including keywords on your product title and description is that it helps users quickly find what they\u2019re looking for, and it also raises the ranking of your product page on search engines.In addition, with WooCommerce SEO by WordLift you can have more traffic to your product page, adding a Product Context Card both in your description and in any content on your website. Indeed, each time a product is mentioned the plug-in allows you to create a direct link to the product page at the product title. In this way, you will capture the attention of the reader and suggest a product to buy, increasing the chances of selling with a simple and beautiful widget.\u00a0Choose Quality Images And VideosIncluding several photos and videos of your product, from different perspectives or proximity, helps your customers visualize what the item looks like in reality, in order to get a more personal idea of the product they're going to buy.&nbsp;Therefore, images play an essential part when shoppers are looking for a product. Also, it is especially true when related to Google Research. In particular, it is possible to buy a product directly from the Google Image Search: the users will see the image of the product on sale with a card icon and proceed to the purchase.&nbsp;To do this, Google requests that you publish your image in different formats to showcase your product within different search features. WooCommerce SEO by WordLift automatically resizes all product images in various formats, taking care of Google\u2019s requirements.In particular, these are the relevant Google requirements for AMP Articles [1]:Images should be at least 1200 pixels wideFor best results, provide multiple high-resolution images (minimum of 800,000 pixels when multiplying width and height) with the following aspect ratios: 16x9, 4x3, and 1x1.(omissis)These are the examples [2]:Example 1, 2: ...  \"image\": &#091;    \"https://example.com/photos/1x1/photo.jpg\",    \"https://example.com/photos/4x3/photo.jpg\",    \"https://example.com/photos/16x9/photo.jpg\"   ], ...Example 3:{  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",  \"@type\": \"NewsArticle\",  \"image\": &#091;    \"https://example.com/photos/1x1/photo.jpg\",    \"https://example.com/photos/4x3/photo.jpg\",    \"https://example.com/photos/16x9/photo.jpg\"  ]}Hence it is recommended to provide 3 ratios: 1x1, 4x3, 16x9 and the minimum width is 1.200 pixels. Hence the minimum requirements should be for a 1.200x1.200 image (ratio 1x1).As a secondary requirement, by using add_image_size [3] we can have WordPress generate the 4x3 and 16x9 images out of the minimum viable requirement of 1.200x1.200 pixels.So you don\u2019t need to do anything, but just sell your products on Google Images.&nbsp;&nbsp;Include Ratings &amp; ReviewsShoppers care about the opinions of other current consumers, and a glowing review of your product might be just the thing that a potential customer needs to influence them in making the final decision to buy. Moreover, it is important to clearly show both the reviews and ratings of your product.&nbsp;Google can show the ratings of your products on its rich snippets thanks to schema.org markup. In this way, you'll provide users with more information and make their purchase decision easier.&nbsp;WooCommerce already has its own schema markup for Product, but it is very basic: using it you can communicate to Google a series of essential data for your customers: product description, image, price, availability, conditions, and user ratings.&nbsp;With WooCommerce SEO by WordLift you can get even more, making information about the brand, the color and the condition of your products (new, used, reconditioned, etc) appear in the rich snippet as well. The result in SERP will be similar to this:Also, by inserting the Product markup, you can have your product appear in Google Shopping tabs.&nbsp;And not only, it lets you use structured data to enrich articles and static pages, creating links to product pages or adding FAQs and information about your organization, as we will see after.&nbsp;Incorporate a FAQ section&nbsp;To anticipate every possible question that could arise, you will need to be sure that customers have enough information to buy with confidence. For this reason, it is important to have a complete FAQ section, where in case of doubt and uncertainty the user can find the answers they are seeking.In this case, by using the plugin you can customize your WooCommerce Product Page by adding FAQs and the how-tos markup to give your users accurate answers to their questions and educate them on how to use your products.Furthermore, the FAQ section can appear on Google results. How is this possible?&nbsp;WooCommerce SEO by WorldLift can generate an FAQ markup for your pages to appear on Google Search, so a customer that has questions about your products, your payment methods, or your delivery options, can find the answers directly on Google. Also, you can catch an opportunity to increase visibility on Google\u2019s search result pages.\u00a0Add Product SuggestionsThe suggestion of related products helps to increase the total amount spent per purchase, by giving consumers great ideas for what they need. In addition, they also guide shoppers closer to the basket or cart thus encouraging the purchase.WooCommerce, by default offers options to set up related products, up-sells and cross sells. In particular, related products are displayed automatically by a random choice. You can increase the possibility of displaying certain products together by grouping them in the same categories or tags, but you cannot specify which products are to be displayed under this section.With the Product Navigator of WordLift, you can customize this section on your WooCommerce Product Page choosing the title, the number of products, the order. So you present your best products related to the content of the page, just by adding a widget.&nbsp;In addition, WooCommerce SEO by WordLift can automatically look into your content and suggest to you related products. It\u00a0 is not only a SEO plug-in but it is actually creating more engagement on your website by providing you with product recommendations.\u00a0Why Structured Data Is Important If You Want Your Product Page To Stand Out From The OthersAnother crucial element in customizing your WooCommerce Product Page is the structured linked data, which gives you the opportunity to communicate search engines important info about your product and of looking favourable on Google\u2019s product listings, creating an informative rich snippet that helps your product stand out on Googles\u2019 crowded Shopping page.How can this be implemented?&nbsp;You can use WooCommerce schema markup, but the amount of information displayed will be basic. Or you can let a tool take care of it. By using WooCommerce SEO by WordLift you can add structured data and extend product markup to your merchandise to get more visibility on Google\u2019s retail listings, making the difference.\u00a0BEFOREAFTER&nbsp;In particular, since July 2020, Google includes free product listings in organic searches. For this reason, securing a spot with more pixels on the SERP is becoming one of the best ways to get your products in front of your potential customers.[et_bloom_locked optin_id=\"optin_9\"] https://wordlift.io/our-content-is-on-your-way-checklist-knowledge-panels [/et_bloom_locked]Your WooCommerce Product Pages Best AllySo far we have demonstrated how you can customize your WooCommerce Product Page and how you can optimise the user experience on your website.

Let's see them together.https://youtu.be/TBqFbFszZIUTABLE OF CONTENTShow your videos to Google with Schema MarkupAdd the Video SitemapAdding a video to a new article1) Show your videos to Google with Schema MarkupIf you want to rank on Google with the videos on your website, you have two options. The first is to host your videos directly on your site; the second is to embed videos uploaded to YouTube or Vimeo.With WordLift, you can easily transform the videos embedded on your site into VideoObject, a markup that allows Google to fully recognise this content and have it appear in the snippet of your pages in the SERPs!(If you already use WordLift, upgrade to our Business + E-commerce plan and this feature will be activated automatically. When Video Settings appear in your settings you will be good to go).The first thing you need to do is to add the API of your YouTube or Vimeo channel to the Video Settings section of WordLift Settings. If you need instructions on how to retrieve the API, just follow the link on the settings screen.Now go to the WordLift menu and click on \"Import all videos\".WordLift will recognise all the videos already on your website and automatically add the VideoObject markup to each one with just one click.What happens now?Just like I showed you in the video at the top of the page: I took an article containing several videos embedded from YouTube and tested it with the Rich Result Test tool before and after importing the videos with WordLift.Rich Result Test recognised the VideoObject markup on every video I inserted into the article. And all this with just one click!2) Add the Video SitemapThe second step is as simple as the first.Go back into WordLift's Settings, on the Video Settings tab, and enable the option that allows you to create a sitemap for your videos.WordLift will automatically generate a link, take it and copy it into the Search Console in the Sitemap section and submit.Easy, isn't it?3) Adding a video to a new articleNow that we know how to optimise the videos already on your site, let's see how to add a video to a new article and mark it up correctly.Once you have written your article, add the video you are interested in using the options provided by the WordPress editor (copy/paste or video block).At this point, proceed as usual: save the draft article and WordLift will automatically analyse it. The only difference is that this time you will also find the video section in WordLift's menu, with an indication of your content.By clicking on \"Edit\" you can see all the properties of the video automatically imported from YouTube, which from now on will automatically become part of the SEO juice of your blog!As you can see, it's really simple. You can focus on the content and create a good video... we'll take care of the rest!Obviously, the more the topic of the video and the article coincide, the better the ranking results will be.If you already use WordLift and would like to activate this function, write to us now or upgrade to the Business + E-commerce plan to benefit from automatic SEO for your videos automatically.If you would like to know all the other benefits and functionalities of WordLift, take a look at this page!",

Now we are getting ready for a web where end-users know and do more thanks to an ever more sophisticated search engine technology - the semantic search.\u201cIn a digital world where search has meaning, content needs to as well, and thatrequires your business also to be able to deliver real meaning in what it does thatgoes well past the product and its sales pitch.\u201dDavid Amerland. Google Semantic Search.Knowledge Graphs, Semantic Search and Your ContentWe live and work in the time of the semantic search, where content marketing and SEO require orchestrated efforts to build a rich network of informational, educational and other content, meeting the customer's needs at the different stages of their buyer journey.This is the time of the semantic search: content marketing and SEO require orchestrated efforts to build a rich network of content and meet the customer&#039;s needs at the different stages of their buyer journey.  Click To TweetThis rich network can be built and managed using a Knowledge Graph.The very strategic edge of Knowledge Graphs for website and other content management is the possibility to take your content marketing and SEO to the next level by unambiguously defining content for search engines on the one hand and the other by building immersive environments of information around products and services for your leads and customers.Knowledge Graphs are the architectures that, once built, can feed search engines and other interested machine parties, like Alexa, Siri, Cortana, Google Assistant, with your first-party published data. They are also the architectures behind your content that help you build (many times automatically) well-contextualized and interlinked articles containing rich, relevant information.To know how we got to the Linked Data in SEO and why you need to build a Knowledge Graph side-by-side with your website to stand out in search results, read our article.What Knowledge Graphs Are Already Doing for SEO and Content MarketingWhen it comes to small and mid-sized businesses, Knowledge Graphs have already proven instrumental. We can tell from experience that building Knowledge Graphs:Improves internal content creation workflows;Improves visibility;Improves Internal linking;Clarifies value proposition in terms of entities. Specifically, several organizations from different verticals have been working with us, investing in building SEO-friendly Knowledge Graphs. The benefits their Knowledge Graph brought to content and SEO:A knowledge graph for better navigationWe worked with the most extensive databases with B2B information, including information about business people and companies to sales, marketing and recruiting professionals. They aimed to enhance the user experiences on the website and to provide better journeys across the content. In this case, building a Knowledge Graph helped our client improve the content on their website and redesign the user journey on it, making navigation more accessible and more immersive.A knowledge graph for semantic searchOne application of Knowledge Graphs for websites is semantic search. Case in point, we worked with a community helping developers learn and grow. They used their Knowledge Graph to link content assets across different sites and eventually build a new semantic search experience.A Knowledge Graph for increased ads incomeLinking data helped a client of ours, a product discovery platform with millions of users worldwide, to increase ad engagement and income. Building a massive Knowledge Graph of products, reviews, and articles helped the platform achieve three figures growth year over year and almost double their ads income.A Knowledge Graph for richly connected recordsKnowledge Graphs are handy when it comes to connecting records from disparate sources. A client of ours, a company helping consumers access and connect their healthcare records, needed to serve their clients more efficiently. Now the company uses a Knowledge Graph - the most significant health-related graph (partially linked back from Wikidata), to serve customers better and help them save money and have access to better services by connecting data about hospitals, doctors and medical services with health content and patient education.While each of these Wordlift\u2019s clients took a different approach, a common thread ran across their way of applying the Knowledge Graph technology. And that thread is vital for it it is a combination of two twisted, working together cables - data and content.This particular interplay of data and content is paramount to SEO and content marketing success in the age of semantic search. It increases traffic, gets more qualified leads and ultimately amplifies online presence, broadening brand impact.Where Do Knowledge Graphs Grow and How To Get One?Google's Knowledge Graph has millions of connected data pieces describing real-world entities like people, places, and things and forming the graph's nodes. In the same way, a smaller Knowledge Graph would have thousands of connected data pieces that include the architecture of your content and data.Below we briefly explain howdy, outlining the practical steps of getting a Knowledge Graph.STEP 1: Semantic Audit: Checking what you already have&nbsp;As a first step towards connecting content and data in a Knowledge Graph, we start by looking at the informational architecture of the website. It is what we call a semantic audit.A semantic audit is a procedure to extract the main topic and the primary entities from the web pages.STEP 2:&nbsp; Building the Knowledge GraphThe next step is building a connected structure of linked content and linked data resources. This is where content (in more detail, the entities it is made of) gets semantic markup. Semantic markup is about adding pieces of code to define the concepts used in the article.It is also the stage where entities are identified in your existing content and planned to be created. Both the current and the planned entities will further make for the structure of your Knowledge Graph.STEP 3: Curating the Knowledge Graph: AI-powered Content BriefsOnce created, the Knowledge Graph is a work in progress. This is what the curation of the Knowledge Graph is - constantly improving the interlinking and the breadth of the entities.One part of the curation of the Knowledge Graphs is about analyzing the top 10 results of the primary search intents around a topic and providing a list of the entities most frequently mentioned in the top 3 results. Further, the analysis serves the content team as a list of topics to be covered, enriched or created anew.Conclusion: From Understanding The Benefits Of A Knowledge Graph For Content And SEO To Reaping ThemHaving walked these steps of building a Knowledge Graph, you will also be stepping on the road to increased engagement, traffic and visibility.In more detail, the immediate benefits of building a Knowledge Graph of content and data are:Automated internal links to boost rankings by robust topical linking;Smart content recommendation to enhance user experience and navigation;Richly connected content to provide better SERP results;Combined content from multiple platforms to enhance search.As a Knowledge Graph simultaneously enriches the experience of your users with content and your efforts in creating content, it alleviates the path of your message to the customer. And your message, in the age of semantic search, will travel smarter with structured data markup as search engines would understand it better.If we are to answer the question \u201cWhy do we need Knowledge Graphs\u201d, the fundamental reason is the foundational purpose they serve: to define what is. When a Knowledge Graph underpins our content, search engines know what our business is about; they understand what each article is about and what concepts we are operating with. And just like learning a new language gives you access to new possibilities, a Knowledge Graph opens up the possibility of communicating with all sorts of humans and machines.Let\u2019s take your omnichannel strategy to another level.Get in touch for a 30 minute brief with our team.Book a Demo[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

Using structured data, you will advise Google about your resort, hotel or B&amp;B, its services and facilities. This will help with your rankings, and in turn, with your sales.On top of that, structured data will change the look of your snippet (that is how you appear in Google research). It will show more specific information to your customer. Furthermore, this will increase the possibility of a customer clicking on your results. More clicks will eventually lead to even higher rankings and even more chances of attracting new customers.&nbsp;Why do hotel chains and resorts need structured data?A resort schema is the more relevant structured data to add to your resort website. It allows you to tell Google and other search engines details about your business and show the rich results: rating, review, if there is a restaurant or a bar, if there is a spa or a fitness centre, what type of rooms you have and how much your accommodation costs per night.

        "text": "Is Rank Math compatible with WordLift? SEO plug-ins, in WordPress, improve content findability, adding special features that affect search engine optimization, web analytics, online marketing, and other aspects.Today there are numerous SEO plug-ins, each with specific attributes and compatibility. We have received multiple requests on the compatibility between WordLift and Rank Math. For this reason, we will dedicate this article to these two tools, comparing them and explaining how it is possible to use them together to obtain good results.What is Rank MathWhat is WordLiftIs Rank Math compatible with WordLift?What is Rank Math?Rank Math is an SEO plug-in that allows you to optimize your website based on widely-accepted best practices. It advises you on the steps you need to take to make your website SEO-friendly, thus achieving better search engine rankings.&nbsp;Rank Math analyses your website and suggests how to edit your posts' settings and aspects for better SEO: keyword selection, performance monitoring, error monitoring, sitemap, image and video optimization. With Rank Math, you can also include schema markup from any page/post or URL on your site or another site on the internet.Every time you write a new post, it shows you a simulation of how your post will appear on the search results page, rich snippets, and how it will look when shared on social media. After writing the text, scroll down, and you will find the Rank Math SEO section where you can preview it and decide to edit it for both Google and social media.&nbsp;What is WordLift?WordLift focuses on SEO Automation and complements the functionalities of an SEO plug-in, for example, Rank Math.Key to what WordLift does are entities. You can use entities for annotating and organizing the posts and the pages on your website. By describing entities and interlinking them, WordLift builds a vocabulary and creates a Knowledge Graph for you. Each entity is an interconnected piece that has been enriched with machine-readable information and turned from words into linked data.The SEO value of a Knowledge Graph based on linked data goes far beyond featured snippets, voice search, and optimization for virtual search assistants.These days, information overwhelms us, and it's getting harder and harder to find the content we're interested in. And that's where a tool like WordLift comes in and does the magic: it helps you create better content that can guide users to discover what they're looking for.In terms of SEO, articles enriched with linked data become easier to find because they make information extraction much more efficient. The concepts mentioned in an article are annotated and linked with massive knowledge bases, such as DBpedia and Wikidata, to provide search engines with crucial information about a specific piece of content and its relevance to particular search intent.Search engines and web crawlers can use this information, now better understandable to them, to directly answer users' questions. In this way, your website will rank better and provide users with the relevant information they are looking for (in rich snippets, people also ask, etc.). The user who lands on your site will then take a path to make their experience significant and spend more time on your website.Our artificial intelligence scans the content of your website and suggests which information is relevant to your business, adding structured data and building a custom Knowledge Graph.Not only, but it also takes it one step further. It turns structured data into linked data, reinforced by the same sources that Google and search engines use to understand the web. In this way, your content is unique, with no possibility of ambiguity with other content, and gains authority.It is a new approach to SEO: from search intent analysis to content generation, from building internal links to improving on-page user engagement.Your content will be better understood by Google and other search engines, getting more visibility and, in turn, getting more customers.Is Rank Math compatible with WordLift?Yes, it is. If you already use Rank Math, you can also use WordLift. The work done by Rank Math and WordLift does not exclude each other.&nbsp;With Rank Math, you can write an SEO meta title and the meta description, your blog posts, pages, and other custom post types.&nbsp;Here\u2019s how to do so if you\u2019re using the Classic Editor:And, this is how you add a title and description in Gutenberg:If you use Rank Math with WordLift, the description is written directly by the AI, and you have to copy and paste it in the Rank Math window.&nbsp;&nbsp;With WordLift, you can add Schema markup without extra work. Once you configure the plug-in, you will be able to annotate your content and, by doing so, create an internal vocabulary for your website or blog.&nbsp;Every time you write new content, WordLift automatically suggests relevant content to mark up. Without additional steps, you can choose what entity type to assign to your content from the options in the side menu on the editor's right.&nbsp;In addition, with the sameAs feature in the properties, you can add other linked data that reinforces the concept and makes it consistent with the online data.&nbsp;Adding structured data, WordLift builds a Knowledge Graph that includes the entities and relationships between them and makes the information understandable to all search engines. As a result, you will increase your rankings and get more organic traffic.&nbsp;To use Rank Math and WordLift together, you must deactivate the two modules of Rank Math where WordLift is automating your SEO: Schema and Local SEO &amp; Knowledge Graph.&nbsp;Go to the Rank Math board and disable the two modules Schema (Structured Data) and Local SEO &amp; Knowledge Graph.&nbsp;Then go to the post you intend to edit as you will see you can add structured data using WordLift.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time see projections of your SEO performance and edit Title and Meta Description using Rank Math.How you see, you can use Rank Math and WordLift together. In this way, you avoid overlapping and use better the two tools, taking advantage of the features of both.[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]Let\u2019s take your omnichannel strategy to another level.Get in touch for a 30 minute brief with our team.Book a Demo",

        "text": "WordLift NG - Consortium Workshop in Salzburg On July 5th and 6th the team at WordLift reached Salzburg to meet the Consortium partners&nbsp; for the WordLift Next Generation project. As you may know, WordLift received a grant from the EU to bring its tools to any website and to perfect anyone\u2019s semantic SEOstrategy [link].WordLift Next Generation is made up of WordLift, Redlink GmbH, SalzburgerLand Tourismus GmbH and the Department of Computer Science of the University of Innsbruck. The aim is to&nbsp; develop a new platform to deliver Agentive SEO technology to any website, despite its CMS, and to concretely extend the possibilities of semantic SEO in a digital strategy. The work started in January 2019 and is being developed in a 3-year timeframe.The project started with a clear definition of the roles and responsibilities of each partner in the scope to improve WordLift\u2019s backend to enrich RDF/XML graphs with semantic similarity indices, full-text search and conversational UIs. The main goals for the project are: being able to add semantic search capabilities to WordLift, improved content recommendations on users\u2019 websites and the integrations with personal digital assistants.Here is an example of the initial testing done with Google\u2019s team on a mini-app inside Google Search and the Google Assistant that we developed to experiment with conversational user interfaces.Artificial Intelligence is leading big companies\u2019 investments, and WordLift NG aims at bringing these technologies to small/mid sized business owners worldwide.In order to accomplish these ambitions goals the consortium is working on various fronts:Development of new functionalities and prototypesResearch activities&nbsp;Community engagementWhat is WordLift NG?The study for the new platform for WordLift\u2019s clients started with a whole new user journey, including an improved UX. New features, developed with content analysis, include automatic content detection, specific web page markup, and knowledge graph curation.The main benefit of this development is to exploit long tail queries to be featured as speakable (voice) tagging for search helpers. The new backend lets users create dedicated landing pages and applications with direct queries in GraphQL.The new platform also provides users with useful information about data shared in the Knowledge Graph, including traffic stats, Structured Data reports.&nbsp;The development of NG involves features to bring WordLift\u2019s technology to any CMS, the new on-boarding WebApp is part of that.Envisioning a brand new customer journey, built to help publishers get their SEO done with a few easy steps, the new on-boarding web app guides the setup for users not running their websites on WordPress.The workshop held various demos for applications developed by partners.WordLift showcased a demo for semantic search built using Jina AI (an open-source AI-powered search framework), that uses deep learning models while providing relevant results when queried.With semantic search one can immediately understand the intent behind customers and provide significantly improved search results that can drive deeper customer engagement.This feature would have a major impact on e-commerces.WordLift applied semantic search to the tourism sector and to e-commerce.Find out more about Semantic Search here and drop us a line to learn more. Application of Semantic Search to e-commercehttps://youtu.be/2kYlE-di2cMAustria In Pictures - a first demo built using Jina AI.The backend of the new platformThe backend of the platform is being developed by RedLink, on state-of-the-art technologies.The services are issued within a cloud microservice architecture which makes the platform scalable, and the data that today are published with WordLift is hosted on Microsoft Azure.It will provide specific services and endpoints for the text analysis (Named Entity Recognition and Linking) data management (public and private knowledge graphs and schema, data publication), search (full text indexing) and conversation (natural language understanding, question answering, voice conversation) for its users.GraphQL was selected to facilitate access to data in the Knowledge Graph by developers. Tools for interoperability between GraphQL and SPARQL were also tested and developed.Data curation and ValidationAn essential phase of the project is the collection of requirements and state of the art analysis in order to guarantee a perfectly functioning and functional product.&nbsp;The requirements for WordLift NG were developed by SLT, the partner network and STI.The results of the research activities are aimed at:enhancement of content analysis - read more about this hereanalysis of the methodologies for the identification of similar entities (in order to allow, on the basis of the analysis of the pages in the SERP, the creation or optimization of relevant content already present in the Knowledge Graph)the algorithms for data enrichment in the Knowledge Graph and reconciliation with data from different sourcesOn this front, the Consortium is currently working on the definition for SD verification and validation of Schema markup.This phase will ensure all statements are:Semantically correctCorresponding to real world entities (annotations must comply with content present and validated on the web)and that annotations are compliant with given Schema definitions (correct usage of schema.org vocabulary).Community EngagementPart of the project is the beta testing and the presentation of the platform to WordLift\u2019s existing customers.We\u2019d be thrilled to share our findings on structured data with the SEO community and to contribute to the definition of the future of structured data alongside Google and Bing.WordLift is an official member of the DBPedia community and will actively contribute to DBpedia Global.

        "text": "Entity Based SEO: How To Optimize Your Entity Vocabulary WordLift analyses your content and detects the words representing the main concepts, facts, persons, and places mentioned in the text. As a content creator or editor, you can identify the entities that better describe the essential meaning of your content between those words. With just one click, those entities will be translated into schema.org markup, and, at the same time, they will be saved into your internal vocabulary.What is entity vocabulary? The curated vocabularyThe hidden vocabulary The experimental vocabulary The alternative vocabulary What is entity vocabulary?In WordLift, a vocabulary is a repository of entities. Entities describe the ideas, concepts, places and people you talk about on your website.&nbsp;Entities help organize the content that you\u2019re writing. As you annotate an article with an entity, WordLift creates a relationship between the article and entity so that a computer can better understand it.Every time you annotate an entity, WordLift creates a context card that lets the reader know more about what we are talking about. For example, as seen in the video below, if I marked the entity Schema.org in my article, WordLift will create a card that the user can click on to read more information about that entity. It is the same for all the entities to which I add the markup. This makes the content more complete and relevant and makes the reader spend more time on the website.WordLift, by default, creates new pages in the form of this entity vocabulary. What to do with the new content. We highlight 4 different strategies in this article:The Curated Vocabulary. Start adding the most relevant entities to your website, add a description, featured image and make them user friendly. It adds to your workload, but you can link those pages internally and let Google index them.The Hidden Vocabulary. Use WordLift to markup each page and article on your site, but don't link or index the vocabulary. You still benefit from entity-based SEO, but you have less pages and less content to worry about.The Experimental Vocabulary. Use a hybrid approach to let your users roam free and access the entities while preventing Google from accessing it. Once you're ready for prime time, you can easily switch from Experimental to Curated.The Alternative Vocabulary. You curate your tags and categories, and we do the rest! You don't need to spend time building your entity vocabulary because you already invested the time in creating great tags and categories.Choice 1: The Curated VocabularyIf you curate the entities in your vocabulary, you can expect some organic traffic to your vocabulary pages. In this case, you have to set the Vocabulary pages as indexed for Google\u2019s crawlers and add a link to those entities from the articles and pages which mention them.&nbsp;What does it mean to curate your vocabulary entities?Creating an entity in your vocabulary is simple and requires just a few essential steps.&nbsp;Go to Vocabulary, Add Entity, then add all the information about your entity.&nbsp;WordLift automatically suggests which other relevant topics to mark up (they are highlighted) within the text of your content to create links to other entities in your vocabulary. Complete all the properties of the entity to increase the visibility of your content.Then Publish, and if you go to the Vocabulary, you can see your entity.&nbsp;For example, this is the entity E-commerce SEO created with WordLift where we added Title, Description, sameAS, Excerpt, Entity Type, Image.In addition, you can use widgets to enrich the page and make the content more attractive. We added like the Faceted Search that you can see below:&nbsp;Inserting the Faceted Search widget only takes 3 simple steps, as I show you in the image below:&nbsp;Choice 2: The Hidden VocabularyOn the other hand, you might prefer to focus on your main pages and articles without devoting much time to the entities of your vocabulary. It means that your content will contain the markup, and Google and search engines will continue to understand your website content. Still, the user experience will not be affected by internal links nor Google will index your vocabulary pages.&nbsp;To do this, go to your Post, go to WordLift and add a markup to the relevant entities to your content. Then choose which entities you want to not link to and update.&nbsp;You can choose this solution not only if you don't have time to take care of your vocabulary entities, but also for other reasons:&nbsp;You are using an entity that is the very basis of the topic you are exploring, and you assume your readers already know it enough.&nbsp;It would help if you had to markup semantically your article with many entities, but you are afraid that links could distract your readers.You may have an SEO concern about the number of links on your page, and you don\u2019t want to have too many links per article.You can also globally decide to link or not to link entities in the WordLift Settings.Go to WordLift settings, go to Link by Default. If you select YES, all entities in your vocabulary that you add with markup to your content will automatically be linked. If you choose NO, you will select which entities to link to and which not to.Choice 3: The Experimental VocabularyIn this case, you can start linking your content from your pages without allowing Google to index those pages. Search engine algorithms do not like useless web pages, that is, duplicate pages, off-topic pages, pages with poor content. Using this kind of vocabulary, you avoid showing Google and search engine pages that they might consider irrelevant and penalize your website's SEO.&nbsp;To do this, go to the vocabulary, click the entity, click on Yoast SEO, go to Advanced and change the settings, not allowing search engines to show the page in search results, and update the entity.&nbsp;You can evaluate the results of the content you have chosen to index. Depending on the results you will get, you could decide to start further curating your entities.&nbsp;At any time, you can easily switch from Experimental to Curated Vocabulary.&nbsp;Choice 4: The Alternative VocabularyThe fourth option is to augment your website through categories and tags.&nbsp;With WordLift 3.32 newly released feature, you don\u2019t need to use the content classification pane of WordLift to add a markup, but you can use a tag or a category directly. It means that all your content with that specific tag is already connected to a tag with smart features, and it\u2019s better recognizable for Google and Bing and other search engines.In this way, a tag or a category is treated in the same way as an entity recognized in the content classification box. It makes everything easier because if you are already using tags and categories, you don\u2019t need to do anything else that curate them.&nbsp;Save the tag with all its properties, and then go to the post. You don't need to use the Content Classification box but add the tag and update. You can do the same with categories.Tags and categories are treated in the same way as an entity recognized in the Content Classification box and used to build your Knowledge Graph, making your content intelligent and understandable to search engines. Your website will be automatically optimized for semantic SEO.Watch the video to learn more\ud83d\udc47https://youtu.be/txYd1pis1IkAre you ready for the new SEO?Try WordLift now!Book a Demo[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "WordPress Multilingual: use your favorite CMS in your native language ? Internationalization is a dreamland for every cloud-based business and yet it is the most overwhelming journey you can take. In WordPress, the help of the community and the open source principles behind it make it approachable from the very beginning. Here is our story.\rRemember the first time you used WordPress? If you have started using your favorite CMS in your native language, I bet that your first approach to the platform has been easy and smooth, as WordPress certainly is. Otherwise, you may have found yourself confused by common terms used in a technical context, and by new technical terms that you had to learn.\r\rWhen you start using a new plugin, it's pretty much the same. Your user experience is better if you can read everything - from the readme to the meta-boxes and buttons - in your own language.\r\rNevertheless, to reach most of the users you need to use American English first because it's kind of a lingua franca for anybody who is working on the web.\r\rThis is what we did when WordLift 1.0 was first launched in 2015. Until late 2016, the plugin was only available in American English, even if our text analysis already worked in many different languages. Then, as our community of user was getting larger and international, we started to feel the need of translating our plugin. It was crucial to offer a more accessible\u00a0product, helping our\u00a0users through\u00a0their learning curve.\r\rWe started with our\u00a0native language, which is Italian, and as soon as I translated WordLift using GlotPress, I realized that there were many more users from different countries that needed to use WordLift in their own language.\r\rAnd here is where the community really entered the game and helped us. ?\rThe web is a Babel, WordPress and its plugins are polyglot\rToday, WordPress multilingual is available in 109 languages - including their locales such as, for example, British, American, and Australian English. 62 languages have the full translation of WordPress, while many of them are constantly in progress. The cool thing is that thousands of people are contributing to the CMS translations, and if your language is not complete yet, you can easily join them and start contributing.\r\rThe same goes for plugins. When you install a new plugin, you certainly feel more comfortable if they are in your native language. Polyglots\u00a0- the group in the WordPress community who is committed\u00a0to translating WordPress - use to translate plugins and themes, starting from the most popular or from the ones they commonly use.\rThanks to the contributors to WordLift translations \u2764\ufe0f\rNevine Adel from InsideOut Today sent us a picture of her while translating WordLift\r\rOur first external contributor was Rainer Edlinger, an Austrian blogger passionate about whiskey, who manages online marketing at SalzburgerLand Tourismus and translated our plugin into German.\r\rThen, our developer Stanimir Stoyanov - who is also a superactive member of the WordPress community, and one of the organizers\u00a0of the WordCamp Europe 2018 - decided to translate WordLift also in Bulgarian, his native language.\r\rWe were really impressed and almost moved when our friends at Nelio Software, enthusiast of WordLift, decided to translate our plugin in Spanish after meeting Gennaro Cuofano at the WordPress meetup in Barcelona. ?\r\rWordLift will be soon available also in Arabic, thanks to Nevine Adel Abdel Rehim, who works for our sister company in Egypt, InsideOut.Today, and Danish, thanks to our friend Kim Renberg.\r\rIf you are using WordLift and you would like to use it in your own language, you can add your translations to WordPress.org\u00a0or you can contact me and I will take care of it.\r\r",

        "text": "Alternative to Schema App - Schema Markup Tools Structured data has radically disrupted the way SEO is done. There is an SEO before Schema Markup and an SEO after Schema Markup, and this is now clear to every search ranking expert.&nbsp;At the same time, manually implementing structured data is - let's be honest - much work. That's why more and more SEO consultants, editors and marketers are turning to solutions that simplify content markup.Schema App was one of the pioneers in this market and one of the first to offer a tool that helps manage structured data more easily.In this article, we will try to compare Schema App with our solution, WordLift. Before we get into the details, however, let us introduce ourselves a little better. :)WordLift is the first solution that allows you to create a knowledge graph used to implement structured data and increase your website's search engine ranking and visibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let's get into the meat of our article, and kick off the comparison!Table of contentsWhy you should automate Schema.Org markupAre WordLift and Schema App alternative solutions?How WordLift and Schema App workContent modelling with WordLift and Schema AppAPIs and integrations#1 Plus: WordLift's Knowledge Graph#2 Plus: WordLift improves the UX of your website#3 Plus: Automatic SummarizationSchema App and WordLift: plans and costsSchema App vs WordLift: pros and consWhy you should automate Schema.Org markup[et_pb_section global_module=\"16465\"][/et_pb_section] As Ryan Shelley states, good content is no longer enough today. If Google's crawlers can't understand it perfectly, your content risks getting lost in the vastness of the web.That's where Schema Markup comes into play. Structured data helps the search engine interpret, categorize, and distribute your content to the right users.If you want to add structured data to your pages manually, you need to know the schema.org specific conventions very well. Otherwise, you will get into trouble. On the other hand, it is also a matter of time. Adding one by one all the proper tags to mark up your page can cost you hours of work for each individual page. This is already stressful enough for those who have a small website. You can just figure out how it can become an absolute nightmare for those who work on much larger sites: news sites, editorial portals, e-commerce, sites of large and very structured enterprises.From this point of view, a tool that automatically detects the \"hot spots\" of your content and suggests how to transform them into markup is a real godsend!Are WordLift and Schema App alternative solutions?Both WordLift and Schema App help you add structured data to your pages to speak Google's language without having to write a line of code.The way they do it, though, is very different!WordLift relies on artificial intelligence that analyzes your content and automatically suggests entities to add schema.org markup to your website. The process is fast and smooth, the interface is extremely simple, and anyone can use it.Schema App instead uses an Editor to insert Schema Markup on every page of your website. In this case, you control the content and fill in the recommended fields (again, without intervening directly on the code). So you have more control over the data, but indeed the working time is longer.In other words, the peculiarity of WordLift is the ability to generate a knowledge graph and use artificial intelligence to extract and mark up concepts extracted from the content. Schema App, on its hand, was the first solution to allow very granular markup customization - something that is now also possible with WordLift Business using Mappings.&nbsp;How WordLift and Schema App workWordLift's NLP (our artificial intelligence) scans the page you're working on and suggests key concepts that characterize the content, identifying the relevant markup.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GA1DM86Eri8As we show you in the video above, WordLift can tell you which entities you could mark in your content and which properties you should assign to them. In addition, your entities are automatically connected with entities that already exist on DBpedia or Wikipedia.In the gif below, you can further verify how easy it is to mark your content with WordLift. Just a few clicks to declare to Google that in your article you are talking about Michelangelo, the famous Renaissance artist; as soon as you do this, WordLift will add the schema type Persona and connect the name to the related Wikipedia page.As you can see, WordLift guides users step by step, and they don't even need to know what's going on the code side. That's why our solution is suitable for SEO experts (who often choose us to simplify and speed up processes), and also for marketers and web editors who don't know code but want to improve their content thanks to structured data.Even if you need to add a new, unknown entity to WordLift (such as a person or a local business), the software will show you how to do it at every step. Once you create a new entity, you can save it and reuse it later \u2014 or other website users can reuse it.Pay attention because this is a key step! Entity after entity, you can create a personal vocabulary of your core entities (concepts, people, companies, places, and more) that you can then use to mark new occurrences on different pages with a single click. What's more, content you've already published can be converted into entities and can thus benefit from better markup and the ability to expand the number of internal links.[et_pb_section global_module=\"8337\"][/et_pb_section] The Schema App Editor allows users to mark up web pages one by one by creating data points for each entity. So if you use Schema App, you don't need to know the code, but you do need to know in advance what you want to mark up (and how) in your content.Basically, with Schema App, you have total control over your structured data. Still, you need a deep understanding of semantic markup and SEO to make the best decisions for your content.Once you have processed the markup, you can finally export it and add it to your page as a JSON-LD.&nbsp;Content modelling with WordLift and Schema AppOne of the biggest challenges you face if you manually manage your page markup is definitely the time it takes to enter data on each page.WordLift has solved this problem with WordLift Mapping, one of the time-saving features that will make you love our software.WordLift Mapping allows you to create templates to apply Schema Markup and a large number of pages more quickly and describe your content model to Google. On each page, you can:Reuse fields that you have already configured through the Advanced Custom Fields plugin or directly through the CMS in useCreate new fields based on schema.org taxonomy.Even with Schema App's Highlighter (available with the Enterprise plan), you can do something very similar: mark your page visually via front-end and scale the markup, using the same template for many similar pages.APIs and integrationsBoth the Schema App Editor &amp; Highlighter have APIs and can be integrated with any website. WordLift addresses different needs and interacts with data from different CMSs through the app.wordlift.io platform.&nbsp;In addition, WordLift provides developers with its own APIs allowing our customers to query their database via GraphQL, use artificial intelligence to synthesize text, classify content, analyze the markup schema present on the site and access many other features.#1 Plus: WordLift's Knowledge GraphSimplifying, we could say that the Knowledge Graph is a huge database where information is organized and related. Thus, the main benefit of a Knowledge Graph is that it allows you to contextualize and connect large amounts of data in a perfectly understandable way for all types of machines.As we all know, Google has its own Knowledge Graph. But not only Google: all tech giants have developed similar technologies to manage data better internally and, at the same time, communicate more efficiently with search engines, thus achieving greater organic visibility.WordLift allows all companies to create their own Knowledge Graph. In other words, WordLift connects the markup schema of your pages with the database that search engines use to understand your online content.Just as your sitemap.html shows Google the most important pages within your site, WordLift creates a kind of semantic sitemap or map of meanings and relationships. The result will then be a network of connections that helps define every concept, person, product, or other type of entity presented on your website, allowing Google to interpret and index them perfectly.[et_pb_section global_module=\"12650\"][/et_pb_section]#2 Plus: WordLift improves the UX of your websiteWordLift's widgets leverage the data contained in your Knowledge Graph to improve engagement on your site, thus marrying SEO and User Experience.It does this through internal links, widgets, and context cards: thanks to these features, you can double the time spent on each page by users and the pages consulted per session in a few days!Data visualization widgets (such as maps and timelines) and widgets dedicated to recommended content will allow you to improve users' experience on your web pages and push them to explore more pages, and increase time spent on the site.And now, let's understand better what we're talking about!Above, you can see the Faceted Search, a widget for suggesting other content to your users that might interest them. WordLift selects each piece of content based on the entities mentioned on the page.&nbsp;Another super useful feature for improving engagement is WordLift Geomap, which creates a custom map linked to your content.If you have an e-commerce, you might find exciting the related products widget - included in our e-commerce extension. Also, in this case, WordLift itself will suggest to you a selection of products based on semantic connections.#3 Plus: Automatic SummarizationThanks to its artificial intelligence and, more specifically, the so-called NLP, WordLift allows you to summarize your contents in a few lines. This function generates an extract that WordLift uses in various ways:To add the schema.org property description;To create interactive context cards that are activated when you mouse over internal links;To suggest an automatic Excerpt that WordPress uses where the template requires it.Want to know more? Find out everything you need to know about our automatic summaries.Schema App and WordLift: plans and costsBoth WordLift and Schema App provide different subscription plans. Let's take a look at the differences now.Schema AppSchema App offers two different subscription solutions, the Pro version and the Enterprise version. There is also a free version of the WordPress software that includes automatic markup of Posts and Pages. However, the free plan is quite basic and allows only minimal customizations. Here you can see the Schema Types offered with the free plugin:It would be best to consider that the simplified automatic markup has limited benefits, as the output is very repetitive and therefore not very useful for search engines. That's why, in any case, the Pro version is highly recommended for anyone who wants to get serious about structured data.WordLiftWordLift subscription plans, on the other hand, all give you access to the same technology. Any plan you choose, you can indeed:Use artificial intelligence to automate content analysis and Schema Markup implementation;Publish your Knowledge Graph;Access the recommended content widget.Users who choose WordLift's Business Subscription Plan also have access to the E-Commerce extension, which enables advanced markup functionality for shops and product suggestion widgets, and also allows you to create a specific Knowledge Graph for products on sale.Schema App vs WordLift: pros and consAs you've probably figured out by now, Schema App and WordLift are very different solutions for handling structured data, each with its own specific advantages. Let's try to compare them in this summary table:WordLift&nbsp;Schema AppWordLift provides a simple and intuitive interface that allows anyone to add schema markup to pages. AI creates a guided path and follows you step by step.Schema App gives users more control over the structured data they create.With the support of artificial intelligence, WordLift allows SEO experts to speed up, automate, and eventually delegate markup-related tasks.Even if you don't have to write a single line of code, Schema App requires a good knowledge of schema markup.WordLift automatically creates your Knowledge Graph from the data you enter. In addition, it links new entities with DBpedia, Freebase, GeoNames and other compatible data sources.&nbsp;In addition, the entities you create with WordLift can be linked directly from Wikidata using - on the corresponding entity page in Wikidata - the WordLift URL property (which is now part of the Wikidata ontology).With Schema App, you can add links to DBpedia as sameAs to connect your data with the web of data, but you will have to create the connections manually.WordLift offers Knowledge Graph-based widgets that enhance the user experience on the site by making it easier to view and link to web content.Schema App manages schema.org markup but it doesn't have any recommendation widgets to add to the content.With WordLift Mapping, you can use a template to add schema markup to multiple pages and describe your content model to Google.&nbsp;Schema App does the same thing through the Highlighter feature (available in the Enterprise version).With Highlighter, you can visually mark up any page and reuse the markup in similar pages.WordLift does not have a free version.Our subscriptions start at \u20ac588 per year.The free version of Schema App for WordPress is minimal and allows you to add basic markup to your Posts and Pages.Schema App Pro starts at $300 (\u20ac254.57) per year.In a nutshell, using Schema App requires advanced knowledge of Schema Markup. Sure, the software makes markup more accessible than manual entry, but it could still be complicated for users who are not so experienced.WordLift, on the other hand, makes the benefits of structured data accessible to users with any degree of SEO expertise. Nonetheless, many experts choose our solution for the actual time savings or delegate some of the tasks to junior staff members.&nbsp;However, perhaps WordLift's greatest strength is its custom Knowledge Graph, which gives anyone access to the same technology that the tech giants use to index their content and get backlinks from sources like Wikidata and DBpedia.Want to learn more about all the features of WordLift?Book a call with our experts or try it for free.

A few solutions.Monitoring structured data using your favourite crawlerRun your crawler in Python \ud83d\udc0d  and extract the markup [CODE AVAILABLE]WordLift's inspector to extract and validate your semantic markupIt might seem a trivial question at first, but it is not. After adding schema markup to hundreds of websites, we realized that conditions can differ from one site to another. Before evaluating, if a given markup is effectively helping Google understand the content of a webpage, we need to ensure that Google can crawl and index its markup.&nbsp;Regardless of the format that you are using to add structured data markup to your webpages, whether it is JSON-LD, Microdata or RDFa, you have two options:Writing the code as part of the HTML of the page (server-side injection),Using JavaScript to inject the markup into the page (client-side injection).When using JavaScript, structured data is effectively written by a script that gets executed on the client. WordLift, for example, injects for all non-WordPress websites schema markup with JavaScript.How does Google index structured data created on the fly with JavaScript?Google Search interprets structured data that is available in the DOM during the so-called 'rendering phase'.Google Search crawls and parses sites using JavaScript with a headless Chromium that renders the page and executes the scripts. The crawler will send all pages to a render queue, and the headless browsers will send back the response for indexing. More information on how to dynamically add schema markup using JavaScript can be found directly on Google Search Central.&nbsp;How to add JSON-LD markup to your web pages?There are typically three ways:&nbsp;Using a Plug-in that will do it for you (whether you are on WordPress or any other Web CMS a plug-in is an extension that will add the markup to the HTML of your templates).By adding it manually in the HTML code of the templates and here, we might: - adding it within the page's HEAD section - adding it anywhere else.Dynamically using a tag manager such as Google Tag Manager, Adobe Tag Manager or a custom script. Tag managers are tools that allow marketers to inject JavaScript code without the need to update the HTML code of the templates. This is great because it doesn't require the development team to get involved but, it also might lead to trouble, and it's always crucial to validate your implementation. To give you an example, Google Search might not see a custom JS that gets deferred (loaded after everything else). Rendering resources are limited and if scripts are not executed in a timely fashion simply they won't get processed.I have added a JSON-LD, how can I check if Google is indexing it?You can essentially review your implementation using Google Search Console, the Rich Result Test tool, or the Schema Markup Validator available under the schema.org domain. Let's see how.1. Use the Enhancements section in Google Search Console to see if the markup has been processed.This is as simple as opening GSC, looking at the right markup (i.e. Breadcrumbs), and check the metrics there. While very immediate, this approach is limited to the few supported entity types included in the Enhancements section of GSC. To give you an example, the markup for schema:Person will not appear here even though effectively it can help you rank higher for all personal branded queries.Here is an example of the video tab under GSC\u2019s Enhancements section&nbsp;2. Use the URL Inspector in Google Search Console to check a specific URLA more accurate check can be done by using the inspector. Add a URL there and click on \"VIEW CRAWLED PAGE\". This will show the HTML that Google has been able to parse and index. By looking at the code, you will be able to see if the structured data is present or not and this, of course, takes into account the dynamic data you might have injected using JavaScript.&nbsp;This is the most accurate way to see if Google can index the markup (even when it is added client-side using JavaScript)3. Use the Rich Result Testing ToolThis is as simple as opening the Rich Results Test, entering the URL you want to test, and checking if you receive the message \"Page is eligible for rich results\". The tool is designed to help you see features that will appear on Google's SERP.&nbsp;When you want to verify that an entity type that Rich Result Test doesn't support has been correctly indexed, you can click on If you are testing a structured data type that is not supported by the Rich Results test, \"VIEW RENDERED HTML\". If the rendered HTML contains the structured data you have added, Google Search will be able to index it.4. Use the Schema Markup Validator (SMV)Also, in this case, you can simply open the tool from validator.schema.org, add the URL and let it run. The beauty of the validator is that it will validate the markup using the rules from the schema.org vocabulary rules, and will cover any schema class and attribute \ud83e\udd29.What are the most common pitfalls preventing Google from indexing schema markup?In general, when structured data is missing, Google hasn't been able to read it for one of the following reasons:&nbsp;The page is not indexable,The script doesn't load (due to other JavaScript errors on the page, to a misconfiguration of the CDN or other factors),The script loads too slowly. In this case, Google might not see it; the headless browser might timeout before rendering the code.The need for constant monitoring of your schema markup. A few solutions.While checking the first time is crucial, the reality is that websites change all the time and, for various reasons, you might end up losing all the markup. This happens regularly, and the only way to prevent it is to monitor it.&nbsp;1. Monitoring structured data using your favourite crawlerIf structured data markup is present on a webpage, it can be checked programmatically. Here I have linked the instructions for:&nbsp;Screaming FrogSEMrushSiteBulbOnCrawlWooRank2. Run your own crawler in Python and extract the markup&nbsp;If Python \ud83d\udc0d&nbsp; is your friend, I have prepared for you a Colab that you can use to scan the sitemap of your website and extract the markup. It uses Elias Dabbas's fantastic Advertool library, and here is how it works. We begin by installing the libraries and setting the site's sitemap that we like to monitor.&nbsp;We will read the sitemap and, with a simple instruction, create a dataframe from it. We can use this newly created dataframe (called \u201csitemap\u201d) to run the crawler using the column that contains the url (called \u201cloc\u201d). When doing so we store the data on a JSON text file called output_file.jl.&nbsp;This contains all sorts of information that advertools extracted from each URL but we will focus on a few columns that contain the extracted structured data.&nbsp;We first convert the json file to a new pandas data frame (called \u201csite_crawl\u201d) using the following command:&nbsp;site_crawl = pd.read_json('output_file.jl', lines=True) And then select the attributes we want to monitor. In this specific example, for each URL, we will store the entity type and the context (\"url\", \"jsonld_@context\", \"jsonld_1_@type\") By doing so, we can immediately check what entity types we\u2019re using on the website (see the chart below), but we can also run a quick comparison between the numbers of URLs we have in the sitemap and the number of URLs that contain the schema markup.Now, as you can easily guess, this information can be stored on a database (or on Google Sheets) every day to have ongoing monitoring of your structured data. You can run the code from Colab on a regular basis (here is a link explaining how), or more practically, you can move the script to a cloud environment and run it using cron.&nbsp;3. WordLift's inspector to extract and validate your semantic markupOnce again, crawlers are great but do not always correctly extract the markup added using JavaScript to a webpage. When the data is injected on the client-side, we need the crawler to render the web page much like a browser would do. In other words, we'll need a headless browser Chromium-based that acts just like Google Search. When using, for example, advertools (and the example above in Python) on pages like this great Oxford long sleeve by Oakley \ud83d\ude0e&nbsp; you will not be able to detect the markup. Even though Schema Markup Validator (and Google) do see it.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one of the reasons why we have created our own URL inspector. Using the WordLift URL inspector, we can run a monitoring check straight from Google Sheets. As you can see, the inspector extracts the markup and adds a list of the entity classes in Google Sheet.&nbsp;Our extraction engine can also be used as an API in any workflow, this is actually how we use it under the hood:https://api.wordlift.io/extract?u=__URL__&amp;ua=__USER_AGENT__Where __URL__ is the target URL and __USER_AGENT__ is the browser to simulate. The API will return all the structured data found on a URL, being it injected on the server or on the client. Also, the extraction supports several formats like JSON-LD, microdata, RDFa, and more.Here is the JSON-LD (that has been added using Javascript) as detected by WordLift's extract APITo use the API you'll need a key.Want to learn more about scaling your structured data markup?

[et_pb_section admin_label=\"section\"]\t\t\t[et_pb_row admin_label=\"row\"]\t\t\t\t[et_pb_column type=\"4_4\"][et_pb_text admin_label=\"Text\"]SEO plug-ins help you increase the power of the source software you use for your website (WordPress, for example), with specific features that optimize its online visibility, web analytics, marketing and other aspects.There are numerous SEO plug-ins, each with specific attributes and compatibility. Today, we want to talk about the compatibility between WordLift and Yoast to highlight the particular features of each and show how you can use them together to get better results with your website.&nbsp;What is Yoast?&nbsp;What is WordLift?Is Yoast compatible with WordLift?&nbsp;Is WordLift an alternative to Yoast?How are Yoast and WordLift optimized for e-commerce?&nbsp;What is Yoast?Yoast SEO is a WordPress plug-in that improves your website's rankings on search engines by helping you optimize your site's content and keywords.&nbsp;Once installed to your WordPress site, the Yoast SEO plug-in will appear on each page and post you create. It analyses the page's content and provides suggestions on how to improve it. The plug-in gives you a score, tells you what problems there are and how to improve your content for SEO.As you can see, if you go to your post and click on the Yoast SEO icon, you can see the different options you have to optimize your content.&nbsp;What is WordLift?&nbsp;WordLift focuses on SEO automation and complements the functionality of an SEO plug-in, for example, Yoast SEO.Key to what WordLift does are entities. You can use entities for annotating and organising the posts and the pages on your website. By describing entities and interlinking them, WordLift builds a vocabulary and creates a Knowledge Graph for you. Each entity is an interconnected piece that has been enriched with machine-readable information and turned from words into linked data.&nbsp;The SEO value of a Knowledge Graph-based on linked data goes far beyond featured snippets, voice search, and optimization for virtual search assistants.Today, we're inundated with information, and it's getting harder and harder to find what we're looking for. And that's where WordLift makes a difference: it helps you create better content that can guide users to discover what they're looking for.\u00a0In terms of SEO, articles enriched with linked data become easier to find because they make information extraction much more efficient. The concepts mentioned in an article are annotated and linked with massive knowledge bases, such as DBpedia and Wikidata, to provide search engines with crucial information about a specific piece of content and its relevance to particular search intent.Search engines and web crawlers use this information to answer users' questions directly. This way, your website will have a better ranking and provide users with the information they are looking for. The user's experience will be meaningful and they will spend more time on your website.Our artificial intelligence scans the content of your website and suggests which information is relevant to your business, adding structured data and building a custom Knowledge Graph.&nbsp;Not only, but it also takes it one step further. It turns structured data into linked data, reinforced by the same sources that Google and search engines use to understand the web. In this way, your content is unique, with no possibility of ambiguity with other content, and gains authority.&nbsp;It is a new approach to SEO: from search intent analysis to content generation, from building internal links to improving on-page user engagement.Your content will be better understood by Google and other search engines, getting more visibility and, in turn, getting more customers.Is Yoast compatible with WordLift?&nbsp;Yes, it is. If you already use Yoast SEO, you can also use WordLift. The work done by Yoast SEO and WordLift does not exclude each other.&nbsp;Yoast SEO helps you create Seo-friendly content, save time, build internal links to your articles, and prevent users from landing on pages that don't work, thus losing valuable visits. With Yoast, you can also add structured data to your website. A lot of what Yoast SEO does is automated but still needs your input and some planning.With Yoast SEO, you can optimize the SEO of your content by focusing on a keyword or a key phrase, adding the Slug and a Meta Description. The plug-in will mark the elements in green or orange, depending on whether they are optimized or need improvement. In addition, it will give you a detailed SEO report with all the tips to improve your content.&nbsp;With Yoast SEO, you can add structured data to your website content. In fact, by indicating the type of entity your page represents, the plug-in directly inserts schema.org markup, modifying the code behind your articles and web pages.&nbsp;With WordLift, you can add schema.org markup without extra work and at a deeper level. Once the plug-in is configured, you'll be able to annotate your content and, in doing so, create the entities that will form an internal vocabulary for your website or blog. Every time you write new content, WordLift automatically suggests relevant content to mark up.&nbsp;Not only that, it builds a custom Knowledge Graph that includes the entities and the relationships between them and makes your site's information understandable to all search engines. As a result, you'll increase your rankings and get more organic traffic.&nbsp;Also, with the sameAs feature in the properties, you can add more related data that reinforces the concept and makes it consistent with online data.&nbsp;As mentioned above, Yoast SEO and WordLift are compatible. To use them together, we recommend that you disable the display of type entities to avoid having double markup on your articles and web pages, which would adversely affect your website's SEO.&nbsp;You can do this in a few simple clicks, as we show you below.&nbsp;In this way, you'll avoid duplications, and you'll get more organic traffic to your website and more user engagement without reuniting the potential of the two plug-ins.Is WordLift an alternative to Yoast?More than alternatives to each other, WordLift and Yoast SEO can work together, integrating the specific functions of both.&nbsp;WordLift works at a different level of depth than Yoast. Not only does it add structured data to your content, analyzing your website and making it understandable to search engines, but it builds a Knowledge Graph.&nbsp;The Knowledge Graph is the architecture behind your content that helps you build well-contextualized and related articles and web pages containing rich and relevant information. It takes your SEO to the next level by making your content relevant to search engines and relevant to users, who will have a unique user\u2019s experience. It will increase the quality of organic traffic to your website. This means that not only is your organic traffic to the website growing, but the people who land on its pages are interested in what you're saying.How are Yoast and WordLift optimized for e-commerce?&nbsp;Yoast helps you improve the SEO of your e-commerce. But WordLift does it at a different level. Yoast enables you to enhance the SEO of your online store by suggesting the best practices to follow to get a better ranking on Google and automatically inserts the structured data on your site by analyzing the content. WordLift allows you to go one step further. Use the entities you've added to your vocabulary to build a Product Knowledge Graph that connects your structured data and transforms the information into linked data.In the context of SEO for e-commerce, structured data is essential. With WordLift, you can add structured data to your online store's products and make them eligible for specific rich results and SERP features like Google Shopping. This allows your e-commerce store to get more visibility and traffic on Google and search engines and helps your pages get a higher CTR. Google will showcase your products in its search results, and the user will find all the relevant and crucial information for their choice and buying process.How your products look in the SERP depends on how deep and accurate your data is. With structured data, your product features, customer ratings, and all the compelling information create a rich snippet that helps your product stand out on the crowded Google pages, immediately catching the potential customer's attention.But that's not all. WordLift creates a Product Knowledge Graph. This specific type of Knowledge Graph helps you perform better in organic traffic, improve your internal linking structure, and refine your product recommendations.&nbsp;If you have a Woocommerce store, you can use E-commerce SEO by WordLift to customize your product pages and optimize the user experience.&nbsp;With E-commerce SEO by WordLift:you can add a Product Context Card to your product pages. So every time a product is mentioned, the plug-in allows you to create a direct link to the product page;you can make information about the brand, colour and condition of your products (new, used, refurbished, etc.) appear in the rich snippet as well;you can generate a FAQ markup for your pages to appear on Google Search;you can customize the related products section with the Product Navigator, by choosing the title, the number of products, the order. So you present your best-associated products to the page content by simply adding a widget.&nbsp;Yoast has also developed a plug-in specifically for Woocommerce. It automatically produces all the data you need to get rich snippets for your products. It also helps you configure all kinds of metadata for your product (such as colour, brand, technique) and merge it into your structured data. Showing the Google Preview for your products, you can know how to match Google search results. Also, show product details on social platforms and improve your breadcrumb navigation.[/et_pb_text][/et_pb_column]\t\t\t[/et_pb_row]\t\t[/et_pb_section]",

        "text": "Top 10 SEO Trends 2020 that you should know! Here are my SEO predictions for 2020. In a nutshell: we need to re-think content marketing from the ground up and we - as tool makers - really need to design features that help you cope with an ever changing search landscape; organic opportunities on mobile shrunk by 9% in 2019 (according to Mary Meeker's 2019 Internet Trends Report) and in 2020, competition will be even fiercer.&nbsp;The success of our company depends on our vision and here is what we are truly betting on.What are the top trends for SEO in 2020?The trends for SEO in 2020, one way or another, are related to Google becoming more and more&nbsp;a digital walled garden: a closed ecosystem with full control over all the applications.&nbsp;Here are&nbsp;the top 10 trends&nbsp;you need to watch in 2020:Google's SERP gets richerVoice search&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;Voice appsIntent-focused content optimization&nbsp;VideoBranding and reputationQueryless searchStructured data&nbsp;Cutting-edge language modelsPage Load TimeNew search enginesA Giant Panda just walked into our office ?(courtesy of Google&nbsp;3D and Augmented Reality results)1. Google's SERP gets richerWith Cameos on Google, mini-apps, 3D images and AR within search we expect the SERP to become a true multimedia hub. We also learned that each new element of this media-rich SERP is driven by its one specific ranking algorithm (see what Jason Barnard calls&nbsp; Darwinism in Search to learn more about it)&nbsp; and that the core algorithm combines all of these rankings into one holistic overview. Following Google I/O, the support for 3D object and mini-apps have been announced; this will further expand in 2020. There are already many apps supporting AR and enabling consumers to see how 3D objects look in your home or how a new pair of shoes will look on you will become more popular (have a look at our snowman 3D example to get a taste of it). This is a complete new perspective - that yet it requires a savvy use of structured data (3D object use the so called 3D Markup). We will also see even more interactivity with Mini Apps - these are custom built applications that you can build within Google Search. We're developing a first prototype and yes - this is also a game changer for SEO.Hijacking Google SERP with Mini AppsWHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT?Forget about being 1\u00b0 on the SERP; keep on innovating with high quality content that can appeal your audience across different search channels (from images to videos, from tweets to news articles). Use structured data to improve your SERP visibility and get ready to experiment with Mini-Apps and Google's new ways of engaging with users.2. Voice search and Voice apps are here to stayVoice is no longer a new trend: voice-enabled device interaction is becoming part of consumer day-to-day information diet.Voice Search Stats by PwC (link to the report&nbsp;)While the vast majority of users are still using voice primarily for basic tasks (i.e. \u201ccall my mum\u201d) we\u2019ve seen concrete opportunities in two areas that we believe will keep on growing also in 2020:&nbsp;Long tail informational queries. We call it Voice Search SEO, and it is about optimizing content for long-tail queries likely to be spoken aloud, providing answers using FAQ markup and creating content like recipes and news articles that the Google Assistant can interact with. Once you see traffic coming in for these long-tail queries on your website, you might want to consider creating your own skill on Alexa or application for the Google Assistant. See a practical example below ?Voice interactions linked to Local Search. Voice has a tremendous impact on local searches and drives valuable phone calls. Just to give you an idea 28% of consumers go on to call the business they voice searched for (source: BrightLocal). &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT?Start by analyzing long tail queries that matter for your business, make sure (if you have a local business) to optimize your presence on Google My Business (GMB) and improve the interplay with your website. Focus on calls and direct messages and always improve consistency. Remember your offline presence is strategic for your online visibility.3. Intent-focused content optimization is the new mantraLong tail queries will keep gaining momentum as voice search becomes more pervasive and Google gets better at understanding the intent behind each query. The game here is to create content that&nbsp; works for your audience by leveraging on intent-focused content optimization, entity-centric content modeling and in-depth analysis of user personas. On-point and authoritative content that respond to specific information need will win. This leads - in SEO terms - to a clear understanding of your target audience (for this you might want to use our Web Analytics Dashboard) and massive restructuring of already existing content to ensure that only your best articles, for a given topic, survive. Get to work - analyze your strengths, spent time understanding your readers and prune anything that doesn't fit their need.&nbsp;WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT?Spend time analyzing your readers, their behaviour and their journey. SEO is about creating an engaging experience that fits the need of the users. Make sure you only keep the best for them, consolidate content and spend time on improving your content model. Want to learn more about our entity-based content model?&nbsp;Book a call with us, we're here to help you grow your business.4. Video keeps growing&nbsp;Video will grow and YouTube, besides being the second largest search engine after Google, has become your new TV (6 out of 10 people in 2019 prefer YouTube over TV). Current internet users (especially from younger generations) tend to prefer getting information from on-line videos. In pure SEO terms video is a terrific channel and whether you use YouTube or your own video platform getting videos on Google Search, Google Images and Google Discover is strategic. Using structured data here is a must and opens the door to an engaging user experience.&nbsp;WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT?It's time to setup your killer video studio and start filming. You don't need to break your bank, things can be done on budget and with . high quality. Use structured data to promote your content on the website and define a healthy strategy to engage with new users on YouTube.5. Branding and reputation are essentialBranding and reputation are essential in modern SEO; earning your presence in the knowledge graph has a tremendous impact across multiple platforms (from Google Search to Google Images, from Google Discover to Bing Search) - and requires consistency, strategy, some understanding of linked data publishing and content quality (for all your E-A-T challenges and SEO questions Lily Ray is the right person to engage with).Creating your digital brand means cultivating, nurturing and optimizing your presence in Google and Bing Knowledge Graph. Verifying, claiming the entity, using structured data and helping the gatekeepers (Google, Bing, Facebook etc.) let you interact with your audience. It also means monitoring the changes and to this regard you might want to read the recent study Jason Barnard did while tracking changes in the Google Knowledge Graph.&nbsp;WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT?Get on the Google's Knowledge Graph and Bing's Graph, curate your entity on your own websites using structured linked data and remember, SEO is about branding as much as it is about disseminating high quality content. Define a clear KPI to make sure you keep on improving your brand visibility. Need help?&nbsp;Give us call, take the time to visit us in Rome ? and start improving your branding.6. Queryless search goes mainstreamWe saw publishers traffic skyrocketing in 2019 because of Google Discover, we expect these peaks to be normalized and trimmed as more sites gets into Google's massive content recommendation machine. Remember here the prophetic tweet from @methode (Google's Gary&nbsp;Illyes) on this topic&nbsp;and the SEO debate that followed it..@suzukik understood what i meant. Barry took a leap of faith. https://t.co/bKhso9vy2j\u2014 Gary \"\u9be8\u7406\uff0f\uacbd\ub9ac\" Illyes (@methode) November 12, 2019The basic idea is that things will change very quickly on this front. We have seen websites that in less than 10 months have accumulated a staggering amount of clicks and sites that got no clicks at all. I do expect this to change and the traffic to be distributed across a larger spectrum of websites in 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Google Discover ReportWHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT?Once again here it is all about proper structured data implementation, AMP support and hi-res images. Here is my updated checklist to optimize your content for Google Discover: read it all up and get ready for a completely new stream of traffic.&nbsp;7. Structured data is your new sitemap and...a lot moreUsing schema is not only vital to let search engines present your content via featured snippets but has also become a way to help Google understand how the content on your site is connected. Learn schema markup and start thinking like a crawler (or let WordLift do the work for you ?) translates whatever content you think is important in a structured linked graph. We've seen literally magic happening this year with sites using our SEO-designed knowledge graphs (i.e. a 68% organic growth on the Salzburgerland website in an ultra-competitive landscape such as traveling and with a growing number of queries ending up in zero clicks). I also expect to see more concrete use-cases where structured data is not only used for SEO but becomes a building block of the content strategy (our Semantic Web Analytics Dashboard has been a success and we expect more people using on-page structured data to improve analytics, to improve user experience, to train new recommendation systems and to structure content).WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT?Do what Google does: build your own knowledge graph and automate structured data markup with WordLift. Structured data is no longer about rich results, it is an essential building block of your content strategy.&nbsp;Contact us to learn more8. Cutting-edge language models boost your writing creativity and provide further help with SEO ?Programming is no longer the same, machine learning and natural language processing are a natural fit with creativity, content writing and content optimization in general. 2019 will be remembered as the year when NLP literally exploded, we witnessed one innovation after the other (from GPT-2 to BERT, from DistilledBERT to ALBERT) and an unprecedented level of improvements across the most daring NLP tasks such as content understanding, QAs answering, content generation and more. Unlike simpler language generation approaches like the good ol' Markov chains, which only work with a limited vocabulary, ML models using the transformer architecture can learn larger patterns of grammar and semantics and re-apply them in completely different contexts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The improvements of transfer learning from large-scale language models in 2019Smaller, faster, cheaper and improved language models have revolutionized the world of NLP in 2019 (read this article here from one of the team driving this revolution of large scale language models).Finally, the night has came and I can play with Question Answering using #Bert Large whole-word version on quotes from Umberto Eco, \"The Name of the Rose\" #NLP @TheodoraPetkova isn't this new wave of language models an incredible creative opportunity for content writers? pic.twitter.com/BSwN7elmAh\u2014 Andrea Volpini (@cyberandy) December 21, 2019WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT?Needless to say, I see this trend evolving in 2020 and we\u2019re doing our very best to bring these innovations to WordLift (have a look at how we\u2019re planning to help you summarize blog posts using BERT). This is by far the area where I see most of the&nbsp; opportunities in 2020, not only in terms of SEO automation but also in terms of content creation and optimization. Stay tuned, follow me on Twitter and get ready to improve your publishing workflow with the help of AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;9. Page Load Time continues to rule your worldThe speed of websites and the different tasks that concur to the loading of a webpage will remain a key factor in SEO. Google has imposed - in the summer of 2018 - to improve the loading speed of websites and will continue to do so in 2020. The more we interact with our content using Google Search, Google Discover, Google Images and Google Assistant and the more our website need to be top performing. From improving Time To First Byte to skimming down complexity from HTML files we will continue to spend a lot of energy to make our websites blazing fast. Nothing new really - this was exactly the same target we had last year - it remains highly important but we have now more technology and more metrics to keep on improving (GSC, introduced a brand new speed report in 2019).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT?Always remember: Google will see and evaluate your website as a user with an average mobile phone connected on a 3G network. Do your best to reduce complexity, optimize content delivery and improve loading performances (from compressing images, to shrinking CSS, from web fonts loading to server response time). Start by analyzing your website with tools like GTMetrix and Web.dev and make sure to use plugins like WP Rocket. It's a technical investment, it requires effort but it really pays off.&nbsp;10. New search engines emergeAs Google plays more and more the Walled Garden strategy to increase its market share by literally devouring the user experience across multiple verticals (from flights to hotels, from cooking to jobs etc.) the need for an unbiased and possibly privacy-safe search experience keeps growing and paves the way to new search engines. Not only DuckDuckGo kept growing in 2019 and will continue to do so in 2020 but also Ahrefs (a well known SEO tool) announced the launch of a new search engine to encourage innovation (and to leverage on the raising complaints against Google from publishers). I also expect more SEO-related techniques to improve content visibility across the Amazon platform for anyone selling products online.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Via https://t.co/1n176vSGJo pic.twitter.com/K4qLRUMu9s\u2014 Rand Fishkin (@randfish) December 27, 2019WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT?Do your best inside and outside Google Walled Garden. It's pure fun, Google is still bringing a tremendous amount of value to web publishers and, with most of our clients in 2019, we have seen a double digit growth on organic.

        "text": "Beyond voice search... let's make your website talk ? Hi, hello everyone. We're having an incredibly gratifying first year and I've already presented WordLift and our AI-driven SEO this year at the Data Driven Innovation Day in Rome, at The Next Web Conference and SEMANTiCS 2017 in Amsterdam.\r\rEvery time I accept to give a talk or participate to an event I get scared that I don't have anything new to bring to the audience. In reality, we've been super productive, and it's a great time to share how semantic SEO is progressing and what we're learning as we grow our technology and\u00a0improve the web metrics for our clients.\r\rThis is why I'm truly excited to\u00a0participate\u00a0at two international events this month: on the 14th, I will be at the SMXL Milan 2017 and on the 29th I will be\u00a0at Menlo Park, California, for the IDW Conference. For these two upcoming\u00a0events we are building a cool new companion plugin of WordLift to leave you speechless - and...\u00a0to\u00a0make your website talk ?\u00a0?\r\rhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6L2SqG4Edy0\r\rWhen you publish your content as structured data, there are many different ways to leverage on it and to improve its findability and the monetization of it. It is always a fairly wild ride when working with technology: we\u00a0keep on bouncing between conceptual thinking, technical specifications and very practical examples -- we're starting to test here and now the power of linked data and how it can help publishers interact more effectively with their audience.\r\rThe simplest and most immediate benefit of semantic SEO is\u00a0for sure\u00a0to let your website unambiguously\u00a0communicate with\u00a0search engines,\u00a0gain good rankings and increase CTR. With some work and a bit of luck, your content can also get\u00a0featured on voice search and personal digital assistants (or as someone would call it\u00a0PASO\u00a0the new SEO).\r\rAt the same time, by reusing the same structured data that helps you boost your ranking on your favorite SERP, you can do a lot more.\r\r\rMake your website talk\rA few weeks ago, we've released Doctor Search Marketing, a trivia chatbot which tests your semantic SEO skills. We created it out of a\u00a0template and it was pretty effective, we just had to figure out a bunch of\u00a0questions that could be answered by the entities on our website and we brought both\u00a0questions and their answers into a spreadsheet\u00a0to make it work.\r\rWe have also tested other more engaging ways of pulling content out of WordPress into a conversational UIs and\u00a0I am really excited to share our findings.\r\rAt the SMXL Milan, I will share the stage with Richard Wallis, a maverick of\u00a0structured data, Martha van Berkel, co-founder of Schema App, and - of course - our guest Sante J. Achille, a rockstar in the Italian\u00a0SEO market space.\r\rI will describe how computers understand human language with the help of semantics and\u00a0structured data, the entity-based content model and how it impacts\u00a0voice search results and - finally - how it can help you build a\u00a0chatbot ?\r\rI hope to communicate in these next upcoming events some of the exciting things that we\u2019re working on right now, and a few of the things that we see emerging in the search industry. See you soon!\u00a0?",

        "text": "How To Create Content Hubs Using Your Knowledge Graph Content marketing is about creating compelling content that responds well to searchers\u2019 intents and it\u2019s essential for any inbound marketing strategy.&nbsp;The level of competition varies by sector, but it is in general extremely fierce. Just consider the following numbers to get an idea. There are around 500 million active blogs worldwide and, in 2021, according to Internetlivestats.com, we\u2019re publishing over 7 million blog posts every day! These are astonishing numbers, and yet, we can still conquer the competition on broader queries. These queries, in our ultra-small niche, would be something like \u201cstructured data\u201d, \u201clinked data\u201d or \u201csemantic SEO\u201d. To succeed in going after these broader search intents, we need to organize our content in topically relevant hubs.In layman's terms, we can define topically relevant content as a group of assets (blog posts, webinars, podcasts, faqs) that cover in-depth a specific area of expertise. In reality, though, there are various challenges in compiling this list:we want to identify all the themes and subthemes related to a given concept;we want to do it by using the various formats that we use (content from our academy, blog posts, and ideally content that we might have published elsewhere);we need to keep in mind different personas (the SEO agency, the in-house SEO teams of a large corporation, the bloggers, etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp;In this article, I will share how you can build content hubs by leveraging deep learning and data in a knowledge graph. We will use specifically a technique called knowledge graph embeddings (or simply KGE). This is an approach to transform the nodes and edges (entities and relationships) in a low dimensional vector space that fully preserves the knowledge graph's structure. Here is the link to the Colab that will generate the embeddings. Here is the link to the TensorFlow Projector to visualize the embeddings.Let\u2019s first review a few concepts together to make sure we\u2019re on the same page.What is a content hub?What is a knowledge graph in SEO?Our dataset: the KG of this blogWhat are knowledge graph embeddings (KGE)?Let\u2019s build the knowledge graph embeddingsModel evaluationHow to create a content hubLet\u2019s start predicting new factsExploring embeddings to discover sub-topics and relationshipsLet\u2019s review the concept of Semantic SEOLet\u2019s explore Structured DataTopic ClusteringConclusionMore questions on Content HubsWhy are content hubs important in Semantic SEO?ReferencesWhat Is A Content Hub?A content hub is where you want your audience to land after triggering a search engine's broad search query. A content hub is presented to the user either as a long-form article or as a compact category page (Content Harmony here has a nice list of various types of content hubs). In both cases, it needs to cover the core aspects of that topic.&nbsp;The content being presented is not limited to what we have on our site but should ideally include assets that have been already developed elsewhere, the contributions of relevant influencers, and everything we have that can be helpful for our audience.&nbsp;Experts and influencers in the given subject\u2019s field have a strategic role in establishing the required E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness) for each cluster.What Is A Knowledge Graph In Seo?A knowledge graph is a graph-shaped database made of facts: a knowledge graph for SEO describes the content that we produce so that search engines can better understand it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our Dataset: The Knowledge Graph Of This BlogIn today\u2019s experiment, we will use the Knowledge Graph behind this blog to help us create the content hubs. You can use any knowledge graph as long as it describes the content of your website (using RDF/XML or even a plain simple CSV).In most essential terms, a graph built using WordLift connects articles with relevant concepts using semantic annotations.&nbsp;There is more, of course, some entities that can be connected to each other with typed relationships; for example, a person (i.e. Jason Barnard) can be affiliated with an organization (Kalicube) and so on depending on the underlying content model used to describe the content of the site.&nbsp;Here below, we see a quick snapshot of the classes that we have in our dataset.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What Are Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE)?Graph embeddings convert entities and relationships in a knowledge graph to numerical vectors and are ideal for \u201cfuzzy\u201d matches. Imagine graph embeddings as the fastest way to make decisions using the Knowledge Graph of your website. Graph embeddings are also helpful to unveil hidden patterns in our content and cluster content into groups and subgroups.Deep learning and knowledge graphs are in general complex and not easy to be visualized, but things have changed, and we can now easily visualize concepts in high-dimensional vector spaces using Google\u2019s technologies like TensorBoard. Meanings are multi-dimensional as much as people are. The magic of embeddings lies in their ability to describe these multiple meanings in numbers so that a computer can \u201cunderstand\u201d them.&nbsp;We can approach a given concept like \u201cSemantic SEO\u201d from so many different angles. We want to use machine learning to detect these angles and group them in terms of assets (content pieces) and entities (concepts).&nbsp;&nbsp;Let\u2019s watch a video to grasp more about clustering topics, as this is what we\u2019re about to do.&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvsE8jm1GzELet\u2019s Build The Knowledge Graph Embeddings&nbsp;&nbsp;I have prepared a Colab Notebook that you can use to create the graph embeddings using a&nbsp; Knowledge Graph built with WordLift. We are going to use an open-source library called AmpliGraph (remember to star it on GitHub).&nbsp;Feel free to play with the code and replace WordLift\u2019s Knowledge Graph with your data. You can do this quite simply by adding the key of your subscription in the cell below.&nbsp;If you do not have WordLift, remember that you can still use the code with any graph database organized in triples (subject &gt; predicate &gt; object).&nbsp;To create the knowledge graph embeddings, we will train a model using TensorFlow. Embeddings are vector representations of concepts in a metric space.&nbsp;While there are various algorithms (TransE, TransR, RESCAL, DistMult, ComplEx, and RotatE) that we can use to achieve this goal, the basic idea is to minimize the loss function when analyzing true versus false statements. In other words, we want to produce a model that can assign high scores to true statements and low scores to statements that are likely to be false.&nbsp;The score functions are used to train the model so that entities connected by relations are close to each other while entities that are not connected are far apart.Our KGE has been created using ComplEx (Complex Embeddings for Simple Link Prediction); this is considered state-of-the-art for link predictions. Here are the parameters used in the configuration.&nbsp;Model EvaluationThe library we\u2019re using allows us to evaluate the model by scoring and ranking a positive element (for example, a true statement) against a list of artificially generated negatives (false statements).&nbsp;AmpliGraph\u2019s evaluate_performance function will corrupt triples (generating false statements) to check how the model is behaving.&nbsp;As the data gets split between train and test (with a classical 80:20 split), we can use the test dataset to evaluate the model and fine-tune its parameters.&nbsp;I have left most of the hyper-parameters untouched for the training but, I have worked, before the training, on cleaning up the data to improve the evaluation metrics. In particular, I have done two things:Limited the analysis to only triples that can really help us understand the relationships in our content. To give you an example, in our Knowledge Graph, we store the relationship between each page and the respective image; while helpful in other contexts, for building our content hubs, this information is unnecessary and has been removed.&nbsp;&nbsp;As I was loading the data, I also enabled the creation of all the inverse relationships for the predicates that I decided to use.&nbsp;Here is the list of the predicates that I decided to use. As you can see, this list includes the \u201c_reciproal\u201d predicates that AmpliGraph creates while loading the KG in memory.As a result of these optimizations, I was able to improve the ranking score.How To Create A Content HubNow that we have the KGE, such a new powerful tool, let\u2019s get practical and see how to use them for creating our content hubs. We will do this by auditing the content that we already have in three main steps:Familiziaring with the model by predicting new facts. These are previously unseen relationships that we want to rank to understand how likely they would be true. By doing that, we can immediately explore what list of concepts we could deal with for each cluster.Discovering sub-topics and relationships using the TensorFlow Embedding Projector. To enable a more intuitive exploration process we will use an open-source web application for interactive visualization that will help us analyze the high-dimensional data in our embeddings without without installing and running TensorFlow.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clustering topics. We want to audit the links in our graph and see what contents we have and how they can be grouped. The clustering happens in the embedding space of our entities and relations. In our example, we will cluster entities of a model that uses an embedding space with 150 dimensions (k=150); we will apply a clustering algorithm on the 150-dimensional space to create a bidimensional representation of the nodes.Let\u2019s Start Predicting New FactsTo familiarize with our model, we can make our first predictions. Here is how it works. We are going to check the likelihood that the following statements are true based on the analysis of all the links in the graph.semantic_seo &gt; mentions &gt;&nbsp; content_marketingprecision_and_recall &gt; relation_reciprocal &gt; natural_language_processingandrea_volpini &gt; affiliation &gt; wordliftrankbrain &gt; relation &gt; hummingbird&nbsp;big_data &gt; relation &gt; search_engine_optimization &nbsp;I am using one predicate from the schema.org vocabulary (the property mentions) and one predicate from the dublin core vocabulary (the property relation along with its reciprocal) to express a relationship between two concepts. I am also using a more specific property (affiliation from schema.org) to evaluate the connection between Andrea and WordLift.&nbsp;Let\u2019s review the results.We can see that our model has been able to capture some interesting insights. For example, there is some probability that Big Data has to do with SEO (definitely not a strong link), a higher probability that Precision and Recall is related with Natural Language Processing, and an even higher probability that RankBrain is connected with Hummingbird. With a high degree of certainty (rank = 1), the model also realizes that Andrea Volpini is affiliated with WordLift.Exploring Embeddings To Discover Sub-Topics And Relationships&nbsp;To translate the things we understand naturally (e.g., concepts on our website) to a form that the algorithms can process, we created the KGE that captures our content's different facets (dimensions).&nbsp;We are now going to use the Embedding Projector (an open-source tool released by Google) to navigate through views of this data directly from our browser and using natural click-and-drag gestures. This will make everything more accessible and easy to use for the editorial team.Here is the shareable link to the Projector with our KGE already loaded. We will now discover the facets around two clusters: Semantic SEO and Structured Data.&nbsp;Let\u2019s review the concept of Semantic SEO.We can quickly spot few interesting connections with:&nbsp;Concepts:Google Zero Results SERPSVoice SearchRankbrainGoogle Knowledge GraphContent findabilityGoogle Big Moments\u2026Influencers:Aleyda SolisPurna VirjiWebinars:Machine learning friendly content with Scott Abel (one of my favourites)Events:The WordCamp Europe in 2018 in Belgrade (the talk was indeed about semantic seo and voice search)Blog Posts:How Quora uses NLP and structured dataAI text generation (using data in a KG)...Over the years, we have built a knowledge graph that we can now leverage on. We can use it to quickly find how we have covered a topic such as semantic SEO, the gaps we have when comparing our content with the competition, and our editorial point of view.&nbsp;The beauty of this exploration is that the machine is revealing us years of classification work. While these embeddings have been created using machine learning, our editorial team has primarily human-curated the data in the knowledge graph.Let\u2019s explore Structured Data.As a tool for automating structured data, this is for sure an attractive cluster. Here we can see the following at first glance:Concepts:Linked DataContext Card (a product feature that uses structured data)WordPressSEONLPGoogle SearchJSON-LDImpact measurement\u2026Influencers:Bill Slawski (thanks for being part of our graph)Richard Wallis (for those of you who might not know, Richard is one of the greatest evangelist of schema)&nbsp;Showcase:The success story of Salzburger Land TourismusUsing the slider on the right side of the screen, we can capture the most relevant connections.&nbsp;I am analyzing the semantic similarity of the nodes using the euclidean distance; this is the distance calculated between each vector in the multidimensional space. This is definitely more valuable as it provides a structure and helps us clearly understand what assets we can use in our content hubs. In our small semantic universe, we can see how the concept of Structured Data is tightly related to Linked Data, Knowledge Graph, and Wikidata. &nbsp;The Projector uses different dimensionality reduction algorithms (UMAP, T-SNE, PCA) to convert the high-dimensional space&nbsp;of the embeddings (150 dimensions in our case) down to a 2 or 3D space. We can also use a custom setting, at the bottom left corner of the screen, to create a custom map that will layout the concept around Structured Data so that we will have as an example, on the left everything that is related to e-commerce and on the right everything that has to do with web publishing. We will simply add the terms, and the Projector will reorganize the map accordingly.&nbsp;This way, we can see how \u201cStructured Data\u201d for E-Commerce shall include content related to WooCommerce and GS1 while content for publishers could cover broader topics like content marketing, voice search, and Google News.&nbsp;&nbsp;Topic ClusteringWe can now visualize the embeddings on a 2D space and cluster them in their original space. Using the code in the Colab notebook, we will use PCA (Principal Component Analysis) as a method to reduce the dimensionality of the embedding and K-Means for clustering.We can see five clusters: core concepts (Semantic SEO, SEO, AI, WordLift, \u2026), entities and posts on SEO (including showcases), connecting entities (like events but also people), blog posts mainly centered on the product and content related to AI and machine learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can change the number of clusters we expect to see in the code (by setting the n_cluster variable). Also, you might want to add a set of nodes that you want to inspect by adding them to the list called top10entities.&nbsp;In general, it is also very practical to directly use the Projector with our KGE and the different clustering techniques for exploring content. Here below, we can see a snapshot of t-SNE, one of the methods we can use to explore our embeddings.&nbsp;[et_pb_section global_module=\"20980\"][/et_pb_section]ConclusionSemantic SEO has revolutionized how we think about content. We can tremendously increase the opportunities to engage with our audience by structuring content while establishing our topical authority. It takes more time to combine all the bits and pieces, but the rewards go beyond SEO. These clusters become effective with paid campaigns for onboarding new team members and let our clients understand who we are, how we work, and how we can help them grow.&nbsp;As SEOs, we\u2019re constantly at the frontier of human-machine interfaces; we have to learn and do new and different things (such as building a knowledge graph or training language models) and to do things differently (like using embeddings to create content hubs).&nbsp;We need to reimagine our publishing workflows and optimize the collaborative intelligence that arises when humans and artificial intelligence meet.&nbsp;The lesson is clear: we can build content hubs using collaborative intelligence. We can transform how we do things and re-organize our website with the help of a knowledge graph. It will be fun, I promise!More Questions On Content HubsWhy are content hubs important in Semantic SEO?In Semantic SEO, we don\u2019t target keywords but rather create topical clusters to help readers understand the content in-depth. We don\u2019t simply create pages but think in terms of concepts and how they relate to each other. We want to become the Wikipedia of our niche and content hubs help us in achieving this goal. Content modeling is an integral part of modern SEO. The more we can become authoritative around a given topic and the more we attract new visitors.&nbsp;How can I create a knowledge graph for my website?You can simply start a trial of WordLift and build your knowledge graph ?. Alternatively, Koray Tu\u011fberk G\u00dcB\u00dcR has worked on a Python script that will get you started on building a graph starting from a single web page. Remember that Knowledge graphs are not just for Google to learn about our content but are meant to help us in multiple ways (here is an in-depth article on why knowledge graphs are important).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What type of content hubs exists?&nbsp;Here is a list of the different types of content hubs:&nbsp;Classic hubs. A parent page and a number of sub-pages ranging from a minimum of 5 to a maximum of 30. The work well for every green content and are easy to implement without too much development work. A great example here are Zapier\u2019s guides (https://zapier.com/learn/remote-work/).&nbsp;Library style. The main topic is divided in sub-categories and from there the user sees the content items at the end of the journey. A good example here can is Baremetrics\u2019 academy (https://baremetrics.com/academy).Wiki Hub. The page is organize like an article on Wikipedia and links to all relevant assets. It might appear similar to the classic hubs but the content is organized differently and some blocks can be dynamic. Investopedia goes in this direction (https://www.investopedia.com/terms/1/8-k.asp).&nbsp;Long-tail. Here we have a page that is powered by an internal search engine with faceted navigation. The page is a regular search engine result page but it has an intro text and some additional content to guide the user across the various facets. A great example is our client Bungalowparkoverzicht.&nbsp; (https://www.bungalowparkoverzicht.nl/vakantieparken/subtropisch-zwembad/)Directory style. Much like a vocabulary (or a phone book) all sub-topics are organized in alphabetical order.

        "text": "Knowledge Graph Validation Knowledge validation is an important task in the curation of knowledge graphs. Validation (also known as fact-checking) aims to evaluate whether a statement in a knowledge graph (KG) is semantically correct and corresponds to the so-called \u201creal\u201d world.In this article, we describe our proposed approach for validating knowledge graphs (KGs).Knowledge ValidationApproachWhere can you use it?Tools and TechnologySummaryReferencesKnowledge GraphsNowadays, various KGs have been created. For instance, DBpedia and Wikidata KGs have been created semi-automatically and through crowdsourcing respectively. However, those KGs might have errors, duplicates, or missing values. Moreover, KGs are used in search engines and personal assistants applications. For example, Google shows the fact \u201cGartenhotel Maria Theresxia GmbH\u2019s phone is 05223563130\u201d that might be wrong to advertise because the main switchboard of the hotel can be reached under \u201c0522356313\u201d. See Fig. 1.&nbsp;Fig. 1: Knowledge Panel of Garten hotel.Knowledge SourcesApart from KGs mentioned above, there are various knowledge sources that collect and store content and data of the Web. For instance, Google places is a service offered by Google and it provides data about more than 200 million businesses, places, points of interest, and more. Furthermore, there are other knowledge sources, such as Yandex Places or Open Street Maps (OSM) that provide data about places, restaurants, points of interest, and much more. Those knowledge sources can be used to validate statements of KGs.Knowledge ValidationTo ensure that a KG is of high quality, one important task is knowledge validation: it measures the degree to which statements are correct. For instance, knowledge validation measures to which degree information about a hotel (e.g. Hotel Alpenhof\u2019s phone number is +4352878550) is correct based on comparing information of the same hotel in a set of knowledge sources. See Fig. 2.Fig. 2: Validating information about the Hotel Alpenhof.KG validation carried out by human experts is a time-intensive and non-scaleable task. Therefore, an approach to validate data semi-automatically is needed. There are some approaches that can help with this process, see Fig. 3.Fig. 3: Overview of validation approaches [Huaman et al., 2020]Further, we present our approach to validating KGs based on weighted sources.ApproachThe process overview of the Validator is shown in Fig. 4. At first, users have to set their KG as input to the Validator. Internally, the Validator retrieves data from external knowledge sources (e.g., Google Places, Yandex Places), the Validator performs instance matching to identify which instances (e.g., hotels) refer to the same \u201creal-world\u201d entity, for example, it retrieves Alpenhof hotel from external sources.&nbsp;Fig. 4: KG Validation process overview.Later on, the instance scoring process is triggered and the properties (e.g., name, phone number, address) of the same instances are compared with each other. For example, the address of Alpenhof Hotel from the user\u2019s KG is compared with the address value of the Alpenhof Hotel from Google Places, Yandex Places, and so on. Note that each external source is weighted according to its importance: a user can set the weight of (his or her personal) importance for Google Places, Yandex Places, and so on. 0 is the minimum degree of importance and a value of 1 is the maximum degree.Fig. 5: Screenshot of the Validator [Huaman et al., 2021].Finally, the computed scores are shown via a graphical user interface (see Fig. 5). It allows users to select multiple properties (e.g. address, name, and/or phone number) to be validated, users can assign/change weights to external sources.Full details about the approach, implementation and evaluation are provided at [Huaman et al., 2021].Where can you use it?A user can check whether the information for his or her hotel or other business provided by Google Places, Yandex Places, and other sources are correct and up-to-date.A user could want to validate if the provided information is correct based on different knowledge sources.The approach might be used to link user\u2019s KG with Google Places, Yandex Places, and so on.Tools and TechnologyThe Validator was developed by three students from the University of Innsbruck, in the context of the Eurostars co-funded project WordLift Next Generation.SummaryConceptualization of a new KG Validation approach and a first prototypical implementation thereof.Showcasing use cases where it can be used.Validating KGs ensures that major search engines show the correct information about your business.References[Huaman et al., 2021] Huaman E., Tauqeer A., Fensel A.

        "text": "Top 7 SEO Trends 2021 that you should know! Here are my SEO predictions for 2021.&nbsp;Disclaimer: All ideas are mine, and I verified all statements, but I have used GPT-3's 175B parameter davinci model to expand my thoughts further. You will find the AI's contributions highlighted in the text (my input in bold and its response following?).&nbsp;In a nutshell:&nbsp;Successful companies in 2021 will invest in interconnectedness to craft personalized digital experiences. SEO will evolve and will foster human-AI collaboration to unprecedented levels. We will see robots taking new responsibility in content marketing, technical SEO, and innovative publishing workflows.We live in a world that we have not experienced before - COVID-19 has imposed unprecedented measures. It has significantly impacted our economy, the digital marketing landscape, and everyone's life/work balance. This year was like no other: at current course and speed, in a few months, unemployment could reach levels not seen since the Great Depression, but at the same time, the pandemic has fueled digital transformation and the economic growth of digital services to unprecedented levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This blog post is also available as Web Story ?&nbsp; \"SEO Trends 2021\"The success of WordLift, this year more than any other year, is the result of the work that we do with our amazing clients (and I cannot thank them enough for all the support and the interactions that we have).&nbsp;These are the trends that we will be betting on for our product's roadmap and the success of our clients.What are the top trends for SEO in 2021?The trends for SEO in 2021 are related to creating easy-to-use, intuitive digital experiences across channels and devices with data and artificial intelligence. Here are the top 7 trends you need to watch in 2021:Natural Language GenerationStructured Data &amp; New SERP FeaturesPassage-Based Content Optimization&nbsp;E-Commerce, everywhereYour Graph &amp; Brand SERP OptimizationQueryless search and Web StoriesSEO AutomationNatural Language Generation is becoming an integral part of your workflow ?Marketing is no longer the same. Machine learning and natural language processing are a natural fit for creativity, content writing, and general content optimization. 2020, much like the previous year, has witnessed one innovation after the other (from T5 to GPT-3 from PEGASUS to Turing-NLG) and an unprecedented level of improvements across the most daring NLP tasks such as content understanding, QAs answering, content generation, and more. Unlike simpler language generation approaches like the good ol' Markov chains, which only work with a limited vocabulary, ML models using the transformer architecture can learn larger grammar and semantics patterns and re-apply them in entirely different contexts.The evolution of Language ModelsCan algorithms become writers? ? Can bots become artists? The answer is yes, and the results are fascinating. My latest article for The Guardian, \u201cCan algorithms become writers? Can bots become artists?\u201d, explores the work of three researchers who have built algorithms to generate poetry, fiction, and music?.We have tirelessly worked during 2020 on the semi-automated generation of meta descriptions, story highlights (3 or 4 sentences that condense the entire article), and FAQ for hundreds of websites.&nbsp;&nbsp;I see this trend evolving in 2021 and as I am happy to now have a simple way to summarize blog posts in WordLift, there is so much more that can be done to reduce the time spent in content research and make content easier to be found online.&nbsp;Do we really need content automation? ? The main reason why you should use content automation is to save time. It\u2019s a fact that you can\u2019t be everywhere at once.You can\u2019t be writing content for all of your websites. You can\u2019t be writing content for all of your social media profiles?.While I don\u2019t yet expect to have TOO MANY articles completely written by machines, in 2021, we will see AI playing a crucial role in doing the following:?1. Gathering background information? (such as reviewing user intents, analyzing search result pages, gathering relevant news on the topic, \u2026)&nbsp;?2. Structuring the content ? (providing the outline of the article, extracting relevant questions to be answered and adding structured data markup)?3. Writing snippets of content ? (think here about introductory text, FAQs, short summaries etc.)&nbsp;?4. Reviewing the content ?(in terms of grammar and readability)&nbsp;?5. Publishing the content ? (making it available to readers in multiple formats)Indeed to quote @GaryMarcus ? pic.twitter.com/UAZc8xROEy\u2014 Andrea Volpini (@cyberandy) December 13, 2020Takeaway: get familiar with robot writers, make sure to plug some of this magic in your publishing workflows but remember keeping humans in the loop is still going to be essential in 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Structured data will shape new SERP features\u2026and a lot moreIt feels like structured data will lay the foundation for the other two -- so time to get comfy with those JSON brackets :-}\u2014 ? John ? (@JohnMu) December 14, 2020Google SERP has changed the layout, and it will continue to do so with new interactive elements that will serve the searcher way beyond what we can expect. In 2020 we have experimented with Google\u2019s Mini Apps that provide an idea of the framework that Google uses for presenting its results to the end-user. While the experience - from the development point of view - felt similar to using Microsoft FrontPage in the nineties, the idea is clear; results are becoming (to some extent) apps.I expect structured data to drive new rich results and provide web editors with multiple ways to interact with Google services (from Visual Search to Discover, from Google Lenses to Google Shopping). So stop focusing on TF*IDF, keyword frequency, and start building entities and your knowledge graph.&nbsp;Write using the tone of Google\u2019s John Mueller.Structured data is so important for search engines in 2021 because ?Google is now using it as a ranking signal (not really ?)How does Google use structured data?Structured data is used to help Google understand what your page is about.It's used to help Google understand the content of your page.It's used to help Google understand the importance of your content.It's used to help Google understand the structure of your page.It's used to help Google understand the relationships between different pieces of content on your page?.Using schema is vital to let search engines present your content via featured snippets and is also a way to help Google understand how the content on your site is connected (as clearly stated by GPT-3).&nbsp;I expect to see more use-cases where structured data becomes a building block of your content strategy (check out the webinar I did with Jason Barnard on content structuring and schema markup) and a way to analyze search intents and organic traffic.&nbsp;Here is a treemap of the queries extracted from the Google Search Console (for one of our clients) that we grouped using the entities in their knowledge graph. By doing so, we can more easily analyze the trends related to entity-clusters.In the end, the more we\u2019re capable of organizing the information architecture of our website and the more we can improve user experience and conversion rate. The page structure is becoming less relevant as users in small chunks consume information (such as PAA, Featured Snippets, and Video Clips) on Google\u2019s SERP directly and across multiple devices. What really can connect your content with the user intent is how the content is organized and linked.&nbsp;Here is the entity-based content model developed for Jason Barnard\u2019s website using schema markup.Takeaway: get familiar with structured data; don\u2019t just think in terms of featured snippets but focus on the content model of your website. There is so much to gain. Remember that building your Knowledge Graph will help Google gather more insights about the entities behind your organization, your products, and your services.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Passage-based content optimization&nbsp;Google is now capable of a more granular understanding of the page thanks to BERT-like language models (here is a good article on Google Passage Ranking).&nbsp;As web publishers and marketers, our goal will be to structure content in such a way that it gets easier \u201cfor automated systems to understand the bit and pieces\u201d as explained by Google\u2019s Martin Splitt in the SEJ interview.&nbsp;While Martin\u2019s doesn\u2019t expect specific actions to be taken by webmasters, I believe a few things genuinely help expand the queries that a page can rank for. Adding semantics and structuring content has proved effective with various content types already for many of our clients. From articles to recipes, from podcasts to products, we apply structured data markup to see an increasing number of search impressions from a broader set of queries.&nbsp;Cindy Krum, CEO &amp; Founder, MobileMoxie, talked about fraggles/passage optimization for years now (here is Cindy\u2019s webinar on this topic). I believe that this will become an important trend for 2021.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three years ago, with the help of Teodora Petkova we began experimenting with intertextuality and what we would call today passage optimization.Read Teodora\u2019s article \u201cCrafting Texts in the Age of Fragmented Reader Experience\u201d on our blog to get a sense of what passages are and how you could reshape your content to expand your reach.Write using the tone of Google\u2019s Martin Splitt. Is long-format good or bad for SEO??I\u2019m not sure that I know the answer to that. I\u2019m not sure that anyone does.I do know that long-form content is good for SEO. But it\u2019s not just about length. It\u2019s about the quality of the content.In my opinion, long-format content is good for SEO because it provides a better user experience, which in turn leads to better user engagement, which leads to more links and social share. But the quality of the content is the most important factor?.How to optimize for passage ranking?Here is what we learned so far:&nbsp;Add relevant FAQ for the target query and use structured data markup to highlight themWhen writing the answer, remember to keep it between 40-50 words (as it might also become a featured snippet)&nbsp;Add links in these FAQ answers; these links will maintain a healthy CTR and will be highlighted in bold when the passage is presented as a search snippet, featured snippet and in the People Also AskKeep in mind that passage rank when they provide a consistent answer that can be spoken aloud&nbsp;How to help Google read inside my videos?&nbsp;While unrelated to what Google calls Passage Ranking,&nbsp;video content&nbsp;is also becoming more accessible. It can now be divided into chunks that have -&nbsp;much like passages do&nbsp;- their ranking opportunity in Google Search.&nbsp;Video Key Moments on Google SearchThis feature that now works only for English videos hosted on YouTube when we provide the timestamp information within the video description will also become available outside of YouTube and thanks to the implementation of the&nbsp;Clip structured data markup.&nbsp;&nbsp;Takeaway: let the content model drive more granular queries to your website. Be ready to improve headings and to create opportunities for natural jump links to chunks of content. Embrace long-form but build multiple segments out of it. Use schema markup to semantically organize your assets (articles, courses, videos, podcasts, etc.). Improve how users move internally on your website (internal links and content recommendations) and don't forget voice queries are on the rise.&nbsp;4. E-Commerce booms and makes us rethink SEOIf you asked me two years ago, E-Commerce was not a priority for our product\u2019s roadmap. In 2020 we have intensively worked on E-Commerce with retailers from all over the world, and we released a brand new version of WordLift just for WooCommerce. It\u2019s been a revolution on all fronts, everywhere. It was not only retail salespeople setting up virtual appointments with customers but also managers in the public sector, doctors, teachers, and accountants. All of these meetings resulted in more online purchases.&nbsp;Google has brought free retail listings to the main Google Search results page and has improved its Product Knowledge Panels to help consumers get a quick snapshot of information on a specific product entity.As big brands will continue ramping up their online efforts while offline falters, I expect every business to use E-Commerce as the driver for their digital transformation. In SEO terms, here is what we should do:&nbsp;Improve the quality of your structured dataFocus on the search intent and implement a long-tail strategyInvest in Omni-channel SEOPrepare for Voice Commerce1. Improve the data quality of your catalogue and use Structured Data like a Pro&nbsp;&nbsp;The information we provide to Google using Structured Data and Google\u2019s Merchant Feed creates concrete new sales opportunities. Google uses information about products to populate search features, such as product Knowledge Panels or Google\u2019s mobile Popular Products carousel. Structured data is also used to create connections within the Knowledge Graph. The more information we provide about a given product, the more comprehensive its Knowledge Panel is likely to be, and the more Google can facilitate the transaction.Use unique identifiers for all of your products to link reviews, videos, accessories, and other elements that might be scattered across different pages of your website. In other words: build your product knowledge graph, let machines connect everything that matters to help you sell more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Data quality is your new optimization strategy. Especially in E-Commerce, we see its importance. And once the data has been collected, cleaned, and enriched, it can also be shared as a product feed via Google\u2019s Merchant or Google\u2019s Manufacturer Center.&nbsp;&nbsp;[et_pb_section global_module=\"13147\"][/et_pb_section]2. Go long-tail, understand the intent and improve conversions not trafficAs we move from informational to transactional intents, we need to be laser-focused on queries that might have low volume but a high chance of a conversion. Dive deep into search intents and make sure to aim at the transactional queries with your product and category pages. Keep the focus on the consumer and his/her own needs. Let\u2019s do a quick example: the iconic Holbrook sunglasses by Oakley.&nbsp;Here is the existing product overview from Oakley:\u201cHolbrook is a timeless, classic design fused with modern Oakley technology. Inspired by the screen heroes from the 1940s, 50s, and 60s, this design epitomizes the spirit of exploration and adventure. The iconic American frame design is accented by metal rivets and Oakley icons, perfect for those who seek equal parts performance and style.\u201dAssuming we\u2019ll prepare a page targeting runners willing to purchase sunglasses, how should we rephrase this introductory text? Let\u2019s ask our robot friend ?.&nbsp;?Oakley makes a number of sports-and-outdoors sunglasses, and these are one of the most popular. The sunglasses are lightweight, and the lenses are polarized. The lens is also smaller than most Oakleys, which means less coverage over your face and therefore less chance of blocking your peripheral vision ?.Not bad at all ?. Do you get the idea?&nbsp;Artificial intelligence can become our online in-store sales rep that offers personalized guidance and recommendations to our customers.&nbsp;3. Invest in Omni-channel SEO marketingSEO helps you connect with the human beings that you want to reach and get them to interact with you. SEO, especially in the E-Commerce space, is about integrating the customer experience. I expect to see more 3D images and AR within search and Google\u2019s SERP becoming a real multimedia hub for shoppers.&nbsp;&nbsp;With the integration of Google Lenses, we glimpse what is happening and how you should prepare for it. Google Lenses uses visual recognition to scan things in the real world and link objects with digital experiences. Textual queries are losing ground. In some specific contexts (i.e., you are at the supermarket, choosing the right wine to buy for dinner), visual searches are already a valid alternative.&nbsp;These queries - done on the spot right before the purchase - are precious: they help clients make their final decision about your product. Let\u2019s look at an example.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here below, I am scanning a print flyer of WordLift using Goggle Lenses. The brand is detected and reconciled with the entity in Google\u2019s Knowledge Graph, and a link to our website is immediately available. Besides the importance of making your brand always clearly visible offline (from print materials to shop windows), there are several other aspects to consider. Images need to be very well optimized using structured data to provide Google with the necessary clues to connect the image with the entity behind it. From alt titles to EXIF / IPTC metadata, we can do a lot to link the real world with engaging new digital experiences.&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Prepare for Voice Commerce (or V-Shopping)According to Walker Sands one in five consumers (19%) have made a voice purchase through Amazon Echo or another digital home assistant in 2019. Another third (33 percent) planned to do so in 2020.As people become more familiar with voice assistant devices I expect to see more Voice Commerce happening. Google Express, which is currently limited to the US only, will probably go international in 2021.In SEO terms, preparing for&nbsp; Voice Commerce, means optimizing content for long-tail queries and passages. We shall optimize the top-level conversion funnel to help consumers find the answers they need around our products and services. &nbsp;Takeaway: E-Commerce is driving digital transformation across all sectors. The consumer expects easy-to-use, intuitive digital experiences across channels and devices. Marketing products is about competing on customer experience. Data has become essential to link physical goods and services with digital experiences. Building a product knowledge graph is no longer an option for both big and small businesses.&nbsp;5. Brand SERP optimization and Personal Knowledge GraphsMore related entities in #knowledgepanel experiments coming together...The Yellow Koala Family are flourishing :) pic.twitter.com/DzWleHG3wC\u2014 ? Jason Barnard (@jasonmbarnard) December 10, 2020Branding and reputation are essential in modern SEO; earning your presence in the Knowledge Graph has a tremendous impact across multiple platforms (from Google Search to Google Images, from Google Discover to Bing Search) - and requires consistency, strategy, an understanding of linked data publishing and content quality (for all your E-A-T challenges and SEO questions Lily Ray is the right person to engage with).Creating your digital brand means cultivating, nurturing, and optimizing your Google and Bing Knowledge Graph presence. Verifying, claiming the entity, using structured data, and helping the gatekeepers (Google, Bing, Facebook, etc.) let you interact with your audience. It is also a work of consistency and data curation.&nbsp;We had the opportunity, in 2020, to work side-by-side with Jason Barnard on Brand SERP optimization and the various techniques that, by leveraging Google's Knowledge Graph, can convert visitors into customers. We will continue to focus on this track by helping users link their graphs with public graphs.&nbsp;We are also live with our new data platform (codenamed WordLift Next Generation) ??. WordLift NG is bringing support for GraphQL and an extensive set of data management APIs to help brands sell products and services using data marketing.&nbsp;The upcoming future of digital branding is interconnectedness: this can create a unifying vision of your brand using connected data. We don't see Google's Knowledge Graph only, but a growing presence of graphs of all sorts that help machines understand ourselves and the physical world.&nbsp;Takeaway: Creating your graph and optimizing your presence in other large graphs like Google's Graph, Wikidata, Bing's Graph, and other Data Commons resources is an essential element of your 2021 digital marketing strategy.6. Queryless search and Web StoriesGoogle is becoming a discovery engine. More content is actively pushed to users before they make a search.Google Discover generates a personalized set of card style content based on the topic a user is interested in. This content include articles, videos and now web stories (Google\u2019s new multimedia rich content format).We expect more traffic to be generated from Google\u2019s predictive search results across various platforms.It\u2019s an exciting time to learn how to use Web Stories in your content workflow and how to become a predictive search expert. We have experimented with web stories for our clients through 2020. Before Christmas, we launched our first web story about the article you are reading right now \u2014 it turned out to be the best success of the year as we experienced a whopping +504% spike in organic traffic. Learn more about what we learned and how to create an SEO-friendly web story.Takeaway: queryless search is on the rise. To get more visibility, optimize your content for Google Discover and create web stories, that can give your website's organic traffic a boost and grow your reach. 7. SEO AutomationIn 2021 SEO Automation, powered by natural language processing and automatic text generation, will continue to evolve. While&nbsp;the entire SEO workflow is still way too complicated to be&nbsp;entirely&nbsp;automated, I expect to see more&nbsp;AI-driven workflows&nbsp;that will help us improve traffic and revenues.Using deep learning in SEO allows us to interact with Google\u2019s giant brain at a deeper level. It will also help us predict the way forward and more quickly focus on content areas where we have more chances to create an impact.Here is an example: a new tool that we created to help our clients find new untapped query ideas.Takeaway: SEO Automation will continue to evolve. Focus on opportunities where, with the help of deep-learning, you can create a measurable impact.

        "text": "On-Site Search & SEO What Is On-Site Search?Why Is On-Site Search Important In SEO?How Can You Optimize On-Site Search with AI?On-Site Search Best PracticesWhat Is On-Site Search?On-site search is the functionality by which a user can search for a piece of content or product directly on your website by entering a query in the search bar.&nbsp;This functionality, also known as internal search, can significantly impact your website: it allows users to find what they are looking for and discover new content or products they are interested in but didn't know about. It also gives you valuable data and insight into what content or products your audience likes and is most interested in, allowing you to tailor the website to the visitor's specific needs.Building an optimized on-site search can get you more conversions and foster brand loyalty. If the user doesn't have a relevant search experience, they may choose to go to your competitors, risking losing customers.&nbsp;On-site search is critical, not only if you have an e-commerce store. Any website with a collection of content can reap the benefits of relevant, fast, and easy-to-use site search: better click-through rates, more user engagement, and a better understanding of customer needs.&nbsp;Why Is On-Site Search Important In SEO?There is a relevant connection between SEO and on-site search. SEO allows you to increase organic traffic to your website. On-site search makes sure that visitors to your website find what they are looking for quickly and easily. SEO focuses on creating quality content that is relevant to your audience. But the more content you have on your site, the harder it is to get it found. That's why there's an internal search. It makes it easy for users to find your content, whether they're looking for information or products, or services.&nbsp;In addition, analyzing data on searches made by visitors to your site helps you understand which content or products are most popular and if there are any gaps in your content marketing, sales, or product development strategies. Knowing this data allows you to define more effective strategies and actions to optimize your website for both content and user experience.&nbsp;How Can You Optimize On-Site Search with AI?The Knowledge Graph is the key to your on-site search optimization. And below I will show you why.&nbsp;The Knowledge Graph is the dynamic infrastructure behind your content. It allows your website to speak the native language of search engines, allowing Google and others to understand what you do and what you're talking about. In this way, you build well-contextualized, related content that contains consistent information and addresses the needs of your audience. By providing users with a relevant experience, you get higher rankings on Google and more organic traffic to your website.&nbsp;Not only that. We've seen that Google search is changing, moving from information retrieval to content recommendation, from query to dialogue. So the search engine is not only answering the user's questions, but it's also capable of discovering new content related to the user's interests. Training the Knowledge Graph allows us to go in this direction, showing the user new content related to his search.&nbsp;&nbsp;If Knowledge Graph makes Google search smart, it can make your on-site search smarter.&nbsp;Creating a custom Knowledge Graph and then adding structured data allows your website to better communicate with Google and other search engines, making your content understandable to them. The same will happen for your website's internal search engine.&nbsp;So, when a user enters a query, the results will be more consistent and respond to the user's search needs. Also, through Knowledge Graph, you will be able to build landing page-like results pages that include FAQs and related content. In this way, the user will have relevant content, and their search experience will be more satisfying.By answering users' top search queries and including information relevant to your audience, these pages can be indexed on Google, also increasing organic traffic to your website.For example, this is the result for the query vakantieparken met subtropisch zwembad (trad. \"vacation parks with subtropical swimming pool\"). As you see, we have a page with all the solutions offered by the brand and a FAQ block that will help give the user additional answers for what he is looking for.If we search the same query on Google we will have the same page as a first result in the SERP.Search engines use entities and their relationships to understand human language. A generic occurrence of the term \u2018delivery\u2019 on the website of a logistic company might indicate the more specific concept of \u2018last mile delivery\u2019- using structured data the term is lifted as it gets uniquely identified by a Machine-Readable Entity ID that references a similar concept in public graphs like Wikidata or DBpedia (ie last mile in this example). When a term is semantically enriched (or lifted in our jargon) a search engine is also able to leverage its synonyms and neighboring terms. A user making a search for \u2018last mile delivery\u2019 or even \u2018last mile\u2019 on that website will be able to find that page.With WordLift, you can build your Knowledge Graph and add structured data to your website content. Together, we can optimize your site search if you already have it or make it in a way that your customers will love.&nbsp;To discover how you can use WordLift to create your Knowledge Graph and optimize your on-site search, book a call with our experts.On-Site Search Best PracticesTo have on-site search optimization, you can follow some best practices.&nbsp;Make the search box user-friendlyMake sure the search bar is visible from any device and long enough to contain the user's query. Usually, it will be at least 27 characters long. Remember to place search bars on your site's primary pages, but not on all of them. Putting it on the checkout page or landing pages may be inappropriate and distract the user from other required actions, such as purchasing a product. Insert a clear call-to-action in the search bar and encourage research with phrases like \"insert product, code or brand\" or \"what are you looking for?\", etc.&nbsp;Analyze your search dataAnalyzing data on internal searches on your website allows you to understand what users are interested in, what they're looking for, and what content, products, or services are most popular.&nbsp;Also, you can see there may be search intents that aren't covered with existing content, so work needs to be done to create it. (For example, if a user searches for \"how to add FAQ markup\" on wordlift.io, we know we are missing that content, and it needs to be created).Improve imperfect inputsFacilitates on-site search by improving imperfect inputs and making them predictive. Use autocomplete, autocorrect, filters, and facets to assist the search. Users will appreciate it.&nbsp;Make the results page intuitive, helpful, and inspiringSemantic search analyzes the context and searches intent behind the query to deliver relevant results to the user. Also, take advantage of \"No Results Pages\" to make suggestions to the user about other similar content or in line with their search, so they don't miss out.&nbsp;Always redirect the user to the right page (when you have already one)Bypassing the search result page will make the customer journey smoother. If you have a laser target page on \u201coutdoor speakers\u201d and the user is searching for that, make sure to redirect him/her directly there without passing by the results page.Not all result pages need to be the same, you can curate some of these pages to cover long-tail intents that really matter. You can do this by adding intro text and FAQ content on these pages. Now, these \u201cenriched\u201d result pages will also work well in search (provided that you add them to the sitemap).A good-looking search box doesn\u2019t mean anything if the results aren\u2019t helpful to the searcher. And that's where structured data and the Knowledge Graph come in, as we showed you above.[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "Knowledge Graph Hosting As astronomers look at the billions of stars and at the universe expanding from its original Big Bang, we direct our attention to the constant evolution of the World Wide Web from its inception.30 years and counting, the number of websites populating the Web has grown to over a billion and, with this growth, the need to be able to navigate through them becomes more and more challenging.Hence the birth of search engines, crawlers and valuable indexing algorithms may turn the time spent searching for content into a fruitful quest or a damning waste of time.While the market for the new science of SEO was blooming with many trying out different combinations of techniques to reach the sacred grail of the first position in the SERP, the father of our universe, Tim Berners Lee felt something was wrong with the way we were exploiting his creature, the World Wide Web.Thousands of people, and then millions of bloggers, started writing a multitude of words as the digital world eliminates any sort of limit (some may say even decency) to the things we can publish and the pictures we can share, as paper and film rolls are now virtually unlimited.With this in mind, search engines needed some radical change to address the growing list of websites and \"keyword providers\" and their ability to trick their algorithms into finding their way to the top of the SERP.Then Tim Berners Lee pointed us to the way we should follow that is, the world is not made of words but is made of something more powerful: data.The era of the Semantic Web and Linked Data was born. And it all made sense.\"Now, I want you to put your data on the web. Turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential.\"Tim Berners-Lee: The next Web of open, linked data (Mar 13, 2009)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM6XIICm_qo\u2014Search engines looked at the Semantic Web and Linked Data as a way to improve their content comprehension and thus to improve their ability to return the correct results and provide instant answers to users, and 10 years ago defined a common shared vocabulary, that web site owners like you, should use to describe the content.Today using semantic technologies and schema.org is fundamental to rank on search engines and reach your target audience. The schema.org vocabulary is constantly evolved to represent any kind of content, from products to lodging businesses, from recipes to events, and so forth.Several technology providers created tools to provide solutions to content publishers. Some of these tools are mostly an evolution of the standard SEO tools that add some JSON-LD code snippets generation, some other provide complex systems to manage triples in backends, mostly tailored for technical people.\u2014At WordLift we built a Knowledge Graph hosting platform that could bring the real power of the Semantic Web and Linked Data to you, to publishers who need to focus on their content strategy and business goals, to reach their target audience, without worrying too much about the technical details of the implementation.Our Knowledge Graph hosting is based on a modular and scalable platform that can manage billions of data points. For each website we create a connected dataset that conforms to the rules of Linked Data publishing, providing a unique permanent ID to any piece of content you create so that, not only you can reference DBpedia or Wikidata but you can also have their reference back to you, promoting your site to the Linked Data map.We then integrate the Knowledge Graph straight into your CMS where you're used to creating and managing your content. As we worked for decades with publishers, we know we must be flexible and adapt to any context, so we built our platform to integrate straight with your CMS if you're using WordPress, or we provide our own customized hosted version. We also provide APIs and webhooks if you want to integrate with your own CMS.[et_pb_section global_module=\"20098\"][/et_pb_section]Is Knowledge Graph part of AI?We use Knowledge Graphs to feed our AI to deliver the best results when analyzing and generating content.

        "text": "E-Commerce Product Descriptions Using GPT-3: From Generation To Fine-Tuning With artificial intelligence changing the landscapes of many industries, GPT-3 like technologies are becoming well-established and powerful web tools. With the introduction of more capable language models, it's only a matter of time before artificial intelligence writing tools achieve mass adoption. But how do you get a competitive edge when everyone has access to the same language generation tools? How can online businesses leverage the latest technologies to automate at scale without scarifying the quality of content production?In this article, I am going to provide you with everything you need to know about the use of GPT-3 to automatically generate product descriptions for an e-commerce store. I'll give a walk-through of a real-world example of applying natural language generation to auto-generate several product descriptions.But before that, let us introduce these advanced language models, their benefits, and some of the adoption challenges that arise from using them.AI-generated contentA digital threat and an opportunityFrom good to greatMore capable modelsGPT-3: What You Need to KnowWhat is GPT-3?What can GPT-3 do?Is GPT-3 a trustworthy source?But what about the correctness of product descriptions?GPT-3 for e-commerceIs GPT-3 a competitive advantage for businesses?What can GPT-3 achieve for e-commerce?Can GPT-3 generate good product descriptions?From data to promptsThe datasetData preparationPrompt designGenerate product descriptions with GPT-3Test 1: AI-generated descriptions with the pre-trained model (without fine-tuning)Test 2: AI-generated product description using the fine-tuned modelThe seductive path of good enough when generating completionsMore data isn't always betterMaintaining the right tone of voiceNever underestimate the power of prompt designContent generation isn't the final destinationLearn more about Prompt Engineering in SEO, what it is and how you can use diffusion models to make your SEO strategy different! AI-generated contentThe process of content writing is an activity that almost every e-commerce store and blog owner must constantly invest in to produce fresh and high-value content. Content can take various forms such as blog articles, product descriptions, knowledge bases, landing pages, among many other formats. Producing good content involves planning and a lot of effort.A digital threat and an opportunityThe thought that generative AI can write like humans and thus produce infinite content can be perceived either as a digital threat for some businesses or a miraculous opportunity for others. AI writing technology has made tremendous strides, especially in the past few years, drastically reducing the time required to create good content.From good to greatWhile content isn't always enough, only a professional content writer would transform the AI-generated content from good to great. Human supervision, refinements, and validations are crucial to delivering great AI-generated content with the current technology. Human in the loop is needed and it matches Google's stance on content generated by machine learning as Gary Illyes mentions and reported in our web story about automatically generated content in SEO.Right now our stance on machine generated content is that if it's without human supervision, then we don't want it in search. If someone reviews it before putting it up for the public then it's fine.More capable modelsData on the rate of progress in AI shows that the technology is moving so fast. In his recent essay, Jeff Dean, SVP at Google AI, outlines the progress and the directions in the field of machine learning over the next few years. Language models are one of the five areas that are expected to have a great impact on the lives of billions of people.The competition to produce larger machine learning models has been ongoing and, in many cases, has led to significant increases in accuracy for a wide variety of language tasks such as language generation (GPT-3), natural language understanding (T5), and multilingual neural language translation (M4). The graph below, from the Microsoft research blog, shows the exponential growth in terms of the number of parameters for the state-of-the-art language models.The largest model depicted in this graph is Megatron-Turing Natural Language Generation (MT-NLG), the result of a research collaboration between Microsoft and NVIDIA.With these notable gains in accuracy have come new challenges. Therefore, there is a real need, now more than ever, to alleviate the complexity of these models and reduce their size. To continue to move the field forward, new breakthroughs are needed to answer the various sustainability aspects:From a technical perspective, the next generation of AI architectures are paving the way for general-purpose intelligent systems. Google introduced Pathways, an AI architecture that is multitasking, multi-modal and more efficient. Such architectures promote less complex AI systems and allow these systems to generalize across thousands or millions of tasks.Training large-scale language systems is a costly process, economically, and environmentally. Tackling the main reasons that are motivating the race towards increasing the number of parameters is the aim of Retrieval-Enhanced Transformer (RETRO), a new language model by DeepMind. The approach consists of decoupling the reasoning capabilities and the memorization in order to achieve good performance without having to significantly increase computations.With large-scale language models arise concerns related to their truthfulness when generating answers to questions. These concerns range from simple inaccuracies to wild hallucinations. Evaluating the truthfulness of these models and understanding the potential risks requires quantitative baselines and good measurements. In fact, not all false statements can be solved merely by scaling up. TruthfulQA is a first initiative to benchmark the truthfulness of these models towards improving them.What's not possible today will be possible in the near future with the rate of progress in AI. That's why everyone and every business needs to get prepared for the adoption of AI-writing tools. If you're interested in the topic of the rising tide of AI-generated content, The Search Singularity: How to Win in the Era of Infinite Content is a must-read.GPT-3: What You Need to KnowWhat is GPT-3?GPT-3 stands for Generative Pre-trained Transformer. It is an auto-regressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. OpenAI, an AI research and deployment company, unveiled this technology with its 175 billion language parameters. It is the third-generation language prediction model in the GPT-n series and the successor to GPT-2, created by Microsoft-funded OpenAI.What can GPT-3 do?There are a plethora of real-world applications that can be built on top of GPT-3. This technology enables building various tools such as:text summarizersparaphrasing toolsclassifierssemantic similarity applicationsopen-ended conversational toolsFurthermore, this large language model can produce unique outputs based on prompts, questions, and other inputs. In practice, with GPT-3 it\u2019s possible to create:essay outlinesblog introductionsemail templatescopy for landing pageswebsite taglinesproduct descriptionsHere\u2019s a screenshot of many possible applications with GPT-3 as listed on OpenAI\u2019s website.Try our\u00a0AI question answering tool\u00a0to extract relevant questions from URLs and then automatically answer!GPT-3 in actionTo keep this article practical, I'll show an example where GPT-3 returns a completion given a textual input, a prompt. The completion consists of one or more sentences, and typically its length is less than the maximum number of tokens (an API parameter).Here\u2019s the prompt that I wrote:&nbsp;Multimodal search engines are systems that can handle more than one modality at a time. For instance, some multimodal search engines handle text and images in a single query.After sending this prompt to GPT-3, it returned the following completion.&nbsp;This test shows that GPT-3 is able to grasp the context and build upon it to generate related content. Quite good! This is what natural language generation (NLG) is about.&nbsp;As a next step, a human could revise this machine-generated content to verify its factual accuracy before using it. It\u2019s also interesting to use this GPT-3 generated paragraph to draw inspiration. For instance, I'd consider the following subtopics when writing an article about multimodal and multilingual search:Find use cases for combining text and audio in multimodal queriesTalk about documents that contains multimodal elementsInvestigate how multimodal search change the way search engines operateDevelop the topic around different languages, for audio and text, within the context of multimodal searchAddress the subject of combining and ranking multimodal results after issuing a multimodal queryIt's important to note that the completion above has been generated using the pre-trained model without any fine-tuning.Is GPT-3 a trustworthy source?GPT-3 draws information from multiple sources. This large-scale language model has been trained on a vast amount of written text from the Common Crawl dataset, Wikipedia entries, online books, and so on. While it's perfectly capable of predicting words, it doesn't provide the source of information. Consequently, verifying the correctness of the information is beyond the scope of the initial technology.Verifying the accuracy of the information is one of the missing pieces that are yet to be addressed. Efforts to improve factual accuracy have emerged as a promising solution to meet the challenge. WebGPT, a new prototype that has been developed by copying how humans research answers to questions online, has been trained to cite its sources. In the context of Long-Form Question Answering (LFQA), it's one step towards achieving a more truthful AI.&nbsp;But what about the correctness of product descriptions?The general principle of citing sources could be a perfect fit for open-ended questions. But this isn't always the case for many other use cases. For instance, generating product descriptions requires a different solution. The product descriptions must precisely describe the product and its attributes. As a matter of fact, the source is already known: it's the dataset of the e-commerce store that\u2019s used to fine-tune the model. Instead, the e-commerce store would need a way to validate the attributes' completeness and accuracy in most cases.GPT-3 for e-commerceIs GPT-3 a competitive advantage for businesses?GPT-3 has the potential of transforming many businesses across different industries. GPT-3 is a research-driven technology and has its inherent limitations. It shares with other language models several pitfalls that, many of them, are relevant primarily to business contexts. Nonetheless, AI experts and leading practitioners are aware that they can gain a competitive advantage for businesses only when integrating the AI-generated content into data workflows for curation, validation, and establishing safeguards.What can GPT-3 achieve for e-commerce?In 2021, OpenAI reported that over 300 applications are delivering GPT-3\u2013powered search, conversation, text completion, and other advanced AI features through their API. While GPT-3-powered tools, examples, and use cases are constantly growing, I'll focus on a number of use-cases that are relevant to the context of e-commerce. Here are a few GPT-3 powered applications and ideas for various online businesses:Pull useful insights from customer feedback in easy-to-understand summariesAnswer difficult questions and complex queries using semantic searchBuild a sentiment analysis classifier for social media data or reviewsGenerate a product taxonomy by organizing e-commerce products into categories and tagsWrite product descriptions for e-commerceIn this work, I'll deep dive into the last use-case which is the generation of product descriptions with GPT-3. I\u2019ll show you how to tackle a real-world example using a public dataset that anyone can use to generate similar e-commerce product descriptions.Can GPT-3 generate good product descriptions?By investing a vast amount of information across the web, GPT-3 can predict what words are most likely to come next given an initial prompt. That enables GPT-3 to produce good sentences and write human-like paragraphs. However, this isn't a solution out of the box to perfectly draft product descriptions for an online store.When it comes to customizing the output of GPT-3, fine-tuning is the way to go. There's no need to train it from scratch. Fine-tuning allows you to customize GPT-3 to fit specific needs. You can read more about customizing GPT-3 (fine-tuning) and learn more about how customizing improves accuracy over prompt design (few-shot learning).&nbsp;To fine-tune GPT-3 means to provide relevant examples to the pre-trained model. These examples are the ideal descriptions that, at the same time, describe the product, characterize the brand, and set the desired tone of voice. Only then, businesses could start seeing real added value when using AI-powered applications to generate product descriptions. To read more about AI text generation for SEO, check this practical example. The following part of this work will harness the power of GPT-3 to generate product descriptions:Using the pre-trained model of GPT-3 without fine-tuning itFine-tuning the pre-trained model with relevant data[et_pb_section global_module=\"20648\"][/et_pb_section]From data to promptsThe datasetThe dataset used in this work contains a list of e-commerce products. Each product can have multiple attributes and a description. The dataset can be downloaded from this Kaggle challenge: Home Depot Product Search Relevance. The challenge seeks to improve customers' shopping experience by accurately predicting the relevance of search results.In this work, we're deviating from the initial aim of the challenge to adapt it to the use case of product description generation using GPT-3. Consequently, pre-processing work must be conducted to discard inapplicable data and extract valuable data.Data preparationAs mentioned earlier, let's go through the steps behind selecting a product and creating its associated dataset. From the online dataset, you need to download the following csv files called attributes.csv.&nbsp;To help you get started, I prepared the various steps required to load the data, choose a specific product category, and extract the list of products within the chosen category with their related attributes. Find the related code in this Google Colab.In this demo, I chose to generate descriptions for gloves, a product of the clothing category. It's important to note that it's possible to choose a different product from the dataset by running the same code and changing a few parameters.Loading the attributes returns a set of products with their corresponding characteristics and values. Please note that every product has a unique product_uid and can have one or more attributes (column name) and each attribute can have a value (column value).The next steps consist of a number of operations to:clean the datachoose a category and a specific productdrop columns that contain high percentage of empty attribute valuespivot the joined attributes data frame to display the complete set of attributes of a product on a single rowThe following image displays the columns for the chosen product. It's important to note that the columns, which refer to the product attributes, are specific to the product you select. In this case, these columns are related to the attributes that are used to describe gloves. Consequently, these columns won't be the same for another product.Prompt designSimilar to the prompt example that I presented earlier, the data from the previous step has to be transformed into sentences. The goal of this step is to describe each product using the available attributes. Each product will have its own prompt.In this context, prompt design, or prompt engineering, consists of assembling the attributes and their values in sentences. You could have a script that iterates over the list of available products and generates a corresponding prompt for each one. The image below presents a few examples of prompts that describe different pairs of gloves.Generate product descriptions with GPT-3Test 1: AI-generated descriptions with the pre-trained model (without fine-tuning)Once a product is described using a few sentences, GPT-3 can be called to return the related completion. As the intention is to generate product descriptions, the associated endpoint, create completion, is invoked. It\u2019s one of the many other endpoints made available by GPT-3's API. Each time this endpoint receives a well-formatted request with a prompt, it returns a completion.&nbsp;While it's possible to directly use the pre-trained model from GPT-3 to create completions, this isn't recommended for many reasons. In fact, the quality of the completion would certainly be below the expectation in terms of attributes\u2019 correctness, writing style, tone of voice, etc.Based on the result of the following test, it\u2019s clear that the pre-trained model isn't capable of returning good completions. A reminder that completions refer to the automated product descriptions to generate for the pairs of gloves.For this test, we set the maximum number of tokens to 200 while keeping the default values for the remaining parameters. Curie, one of the engines powering GPT-3, is used in our settings. As a result, you can find below a number of completions returned by the pre-trained GPT-3 model.A reminder that the returned completions from GPT-3 contain incorrect information as well as false statements.A first sample completionA second sample completionBeyond the examples above, some completions were very short as in the following examples:&nbsp;Very short completions: \"The measurements of these gloves are: length: 9.5cm. These gloves are manufactured in China.\"Very short and out of context: \"Always refer to the actual package for the most accurate information\"And many other completions suffered from a variety of issues (grammatical errors, poor structure, repetitions, etc.) as shown in the following screenshot.Fortunately, there's a way to produce good content using GPT-3. We'll discuss and show this in the next section.Test 2: AI-generated product description using the fine-tuned modelThe good thing about the dataset used in this work is that it also contains descriptions for a large number of products. In the dataset, you'll find another csv file named product_descriptions.csv.&nbsp;Let's load the descriptions in a data frame as depicted in the following image.As you notice, the product_description data frame and the attribute data frame (from the previous steps) can be joined using the product_uid column. Doing so associates every product_uid with its corresponding attributes and description.As in any machine learning task, the data is divided into two parts:The first part is used to fine-tune GPT-3The remaining part is used to run tests during inferenceAdding more data, whenever available, is recommended in most cases. Nonetheless, it\u2019s of valuable importance to have a collection of samples that reflect the reality of the products of e-commerce. At a high level, analyzing and reviewing means evaluating the data by asking and answering questions like:Do the product descriptions cover the essential characteristics of the products?Are there enough attributes to build unique prompts?Is it possible to map the attributes in the prompt with the information available in the product descriptions?Do the samples in-hand cover a good diversity of products for the e-store?Taking the time to review the available information is obviously what will make a difference in fine-tuning a language model. This exercise will always reveal valuable insights that will help you improve the data before running a fine-tuning task\u2014that\u2019s where the real magic happens.In this work, there are 136 product descriptions available for the gloves. Out of 136 descriptions available in the dataset 110 are used to fine-tune GPT-3. After fine-tuning GPT-3, new completions are generated using the customized model. For the sake of these tests, we made sure that the completions are generated for the same pairs of gloves used in Test 1 and also that these products are in the testing set.In terms of the results of the fine-tuned model, the following two images depict the generated completions.Fine-tuned completionAnother fine-tuned completionDiscover everything you need to know about GPT-3 for product description in our last web story. The seductive path of good enough when generating completionsAs shown in the AI-generated descriptions, GPT-3 can produce convincing sentences. While the general form of the fine-tuned completions looks good, there are some inconsistencies and mistakes related to some attributes. For instance, the first product isn't water-resistant as per the dataset's attributes. Additionally, an SEO would need to optimize the generated content for search and ensure that target keywords are present.As it's clear from these AI-generated completions, fine-tuning the model allows us to achieve much better product descriptions. However, it\u2019s clear that the limited number of gloves as well as other elements are aspects that could transform any AI-generated description into great content.&nbsp;There are many elements that a content writer needs to consider when writing effective product descriptions. Similarly, there are some best practices to consider as well as some pitfalls to avoid when using AI technology to generate automated completions online.More data isn't always betterThe performance and the accuracy linearly increase with every doubling of the number of examples as per the general best practice provided in the documentation of OpenAI. Ultimately, one could augment the data available in this demo to push further the quality of the generated completions. Keep in mind that more data is not always better unless the data consists of high-quality examples.&nbsp;Data distribution is an additional element that can make a difference. One could easily explore the data of the gloves dataset from various angles. As shown in the visualization below, it\u2019s possible to group gloves\u2019 data by color, segment it by the gloves\u2019 size, and color it using the gloves\u2019 type. Doing so is a straightforward way to evaluate the distribution of attributes (color, size, type, etc.)&nbsp; across the dataset. With Facets, the tool used to produce the visualization below, it\u2019s extremely simple, and at the same powerful, to analyze the patterns from large amounts of data. Hence, one could find out whether some attributes have a lot of data while others have less or even no associated data at all.&nbsp;Maintaining the right tone of voiceThe size of the dataset used in this work is small and consequently the number of examples to fine-tune the model is limited. However, this isn't the only challenge. Within the fine-tuned dataset there are gloves from various brands and for various target audiences. Some of these gloves are for skiing while others are for heavy-duty tasks. Maintaining the right tone of voice is another critical element when fine-tuning the model. Grouping brands, products, and using additional elements such as social media copies when fine-tuning the model is important and it makes a big difference.Never underestimate the power of prompt designWhen choosing a product to generate completions, there are some guidelines to keep in mind:To build a good prompt you need relevant attributes. The product needs to have at least a minimum number of attributes. Of course, different products will have different attributes but in general some attributes could be related to the color of the product, its material, its shape, etc.Not only the attributes are needed but also you have to make sure that relevant product descriptions are available. They are essential to fine-tune the model.From an SEO perspective, it\u2019s important that your target keywords be present within the data. Otherwise, the chances to have them in the AI-generated descriptions are slim. In fact, these target keywords that searchers include in their queries need to be part of the prompts as well as the descriptions. For example in this work, this goes back to verifying that keywords like gloves, the type (e.g., skying, heavy-duty, gardening, cycling, etc), and the target audience (e.g, professional, amateurs, etc.) are available in the data in order for these keywords to make their way into the AI-generated data.Pro tip: When building the prompt, be sure that the attributes are relevant and that they also appear in the descriptions (that will be used to fine-tune GPT-3). Otherwise, the accuracy of the generated description will drop.Discover everything you need to know about GPT-3 for product description in our last web story.Content generation isn't the final destinationWith a dataset, a product feed, or a knowledge graph at hand, false statements and mistakes can be spotted using an automated validation process. The validation is a product-specific process. It's a critical step of the end-to-end workflow. This is a post-generation step that aims to identify the presence of important attributes as well as the correctness of their values.At WordLift, we have conceived and implemented a validation workflow that covers the process of automated generation and factual verification from end to end. Scaling this task is possible but, so far, this technology isn't totally capable of acting on its own without human oversight.&nbsp;With the long arc of progress in the field of AI, the pendulum will not swing back. To continue to progress, everyone will need to adapt.

        "text": "How To Get Your Products Into Google's Shopping Graph According to McKinsey e-commerce has been 10 years\u2019 growth in 3 months during COVID-19.&nbsp;This has led Google to enter the online shopping industry head-on, going head-to-head with giant Amazon. To challenge Amazon, Google presents itself as a cheaper, less restrictive option for independent sellers. And it is focusing on driving traffic to sellers' sites, not selling its version of products, as Amazon does. To increase its ability to sell products, Google has launched a series of updates, also aimed at helping small businesses gain visibility for their products.&nbsp;We\u2019re advancing our plans to make it free for merchants to sell on Google. Beginning next week, search results on the Google Shopping tab will consist primarily of free listings, helping merchants better connect with consumers, regardless of whether they advertise on Google.&nbsp;With hundreds of millions of shopping searches on Google each day, we know that many retailers have the items people need in stock and ready to ship, but are less discoverable online. Bill Ready - President, Commerce (April 2020)It is a great innovation. This new approach marks the overcoming of the pay-to-play model of Google. Before selling products on Google, you had to invest money and put in so much effort that small businesses could not appear on Google. With the free listing, Google allows everyone to sell their products on Google property.Product data on GoogleTypically, you\u2019d only share product data for products you wanted to promote on Google services. This changed in 2020 with the introduction of several free offerings. First, it is free to participate in the Google Shopping tab. So your products can be listed for free increasing the exposure of your product to shoppers.&nbsp;In addition, product data from Google Merchant Center is also fed into organic search. This helps Google present your products more accurately to shoppers in organic search. It means that now it makes sense for you to provide all your product data to Google rather than just a selected subset.&nbsp;Google extracts a lot of information directly from web pages, so why is product data different?&nbsp;Product data needs to be accurate. Extracting information from web pages can be less reliable. Using structured data is one way to make sure Google correctly understands all product details you are providing on a web page.&nbsp;How Products Can Appear On Google After UpdatesHere is how Google, on its various surfaces, is improving the presentation of products with special features.&nbsp;Google SearchIn Google Search product pages are enriched with:&nbsp;ratingsstock levelpricing bracketsbreadcrumbs (these are&nbsp; helpful to present the structure of your offer to the end-user).Google ImageAlso in Google Image Search product information are used and include:a product badge on the image (that inform the user that that product can be purchased),stock availabilitywebsite urlGoogle ShoppingWhen on the Google Shopping tab, also additional information is displayed and this might include:local availability (if the product is available on a nearby shop)a link to a comparison of similar productsthe brandGoogle MapsIn Google Maps, when we're sharing where our inventory is located, we can also help users see the products that are available in nearby shops. This is a new feature that is transforming the SERP and adding a lot more competition to online e-commerce.Google Lens&nbsp;Google Lens uses image structured data properties where available.Read our article and learn how to optimize your content for Google Lens to get more organic traffic and visibility for your products.What is Google Shopping Graph?\"Building on the Knowledge Graph, the Shopping Graph brings together information from websites, pricing, reviews, videos and, most importantly, product data we receive directly from brands and retailers,\" said Billy Ready. The AI-enhanced model works in real-time and shows users relevant listings as they shop on Google.Similar to Google's Knowledge Graph, the Shopping Graph links information about entities and influences what may appear in search results. What's different is that Knowledge Graph information comes from various sources and is not submitted directly to Google. Here you can offer product information to Google via the Merchant Center or Manufacturer Center.Google Shopping Graph is growing. Billy Ready said, \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a 70% increase in the size of our product catalog and an 80% increase in merchants on our platform\u201d.How Do You Get Your Products Into Google's Shopping Graph?To increase the sales for both your E-Commerce website and/or local retail shops, your goal is to help Google understand the products that you're selling. We can do this by providing accurate product data using both push and pull strategies:Push: we feed product data using Google Merchant Center.Pull: we let Google crawl the structured data on our webpages.Google is using this data to present products to end-users using special formatting on Google Search, Google Image Search, Google Maps, and now Google Lens. The aim of Google is to guide the consumer throughout his/her journey in making informative purchasing decisions. In the context of Google Search, product data is also aggregated into product knowledge panels that are designed to provide shoppers with an eye-bird overview of all the characteristics, how-tos, pricing details, and reviews.&nbsp;Google stores all of this data in its Shopping Graph made of 2.4 billion products and constantly evolves how data is used on its various surfaces to be more relevant for the end-user.&nbsp;Learn more about how to get product data into Google Shopping Graph, by watching the video.https://youtu.be/UQtdv_hoGuMData harmonizationData synchronization is essential. A lack of it can create confusion and risk your products not ranking well on Google for one or more specific queries.&nbsp;So you must make sure where your product information is coming from and make sure you're using Merchant Feed for structured data. We go from there to enrich it with information that Google will appreciate.&nbsp;On some occasions, you'll have to make strategic choices about updating your data, deciding to put some information only on your website or only in the Merchant Feed. An example of this is the \"in stock\" value. As with other values that can change often, it is more beneficial to keep the information only on one side to avoid discrepancies or differences in updates that can negatively affect listing on Google.&nbsp;Data reconciliation&nbsp;A unique product identifier (UPI) is a number or code that uniquely identifies the product in the eyes of the customer. A UPI helps us identify a specific type of product or a color variation for that product worldwide.&nbsp;As of 2018, UPIs became mandatory to list products in Google Merchant Feed. But the real change happened in 2021 when unique product identifiers became mandatory for free listening on Google.&nbsp;Google said that \"different products using the same GTIN with the same variant attributes will be considered ambiguous and will be disapproved.\" Additionally, Google said that \"if a group of products is identified as duplicates, only one will remain active and eligible to show in free listings.\"Adding structured data to your product page, you will be sure to have UPIs for each product you want to sell.With WordLift, you can add structured data to your product feed, improving your visibility on search engines and Google Shopping. We inject structured data into your catalog and manage it automatically and at scale. Give us access to your source data from your product management system, Google Merchant Feed, or both. We\u2019ll do the rest.How Google Uses Structured Data And Google Merchant Center DataThe following are examples of how Google uses structured data embedded in web pages and Google Merchant Center data for different experiences. Note that experiences may vary by country, device, and other factors.Best Practices For Ecommerce Sites In Google SearchA critical aspect of growing your online business is getting discovered in the search, and Google can help shoppers with this during their buying journey.&nbsp;For this, Google provides you with these best practices that can help you. When you share data about your products, Google can more easily find and analyze your content, giving you the ability to appear in Google Search and other Google spaces. This allows your online shop to have excellent visibility and be found more easily by users searching for products or services like your company's.&nbsp;Do you want to get your products into Google Shopping Graph?

        "text": "How We Got To Linked Data in SEO Knowledge Graphs exist for a long time, yet most of the solutions in the SEO market deal marginally with them, probably because it may be difficult to explain them and even more to manage them in the SEO context.In this article, I will try to give a bit of background information and clearly explain why you need to build a Knowledge Graph side-by-side with your Web Site and why they matter SEO.What is a Knowledge Graph in SEO?First of all, a short definition of a Knowledge Graph by IBM:\"A knowledge graph, also known as a semantic network, represents a network of real-world entities\u2014i.e. objects, events, situations, or concepts\u2014and illustrates the relationship between them.\"To summarize even further a Knowledge Graph defines real-world concepts such as people, organizations, places, events, etc., and how they relate to each other.This is an example of the graph for \"Arnold Schwarzenegger\":In this graph you can see at the center the Person entity representing Arnold Schwarzenegger and its connections for example to the movie The Terminator, this is how Google can understand that The Terminator is Arnold Schwarzenegger. We can also see the birthplace of Thal located in Austria and so forth.Is Google indexing the whole web?This is a visual representation of the Web AD 1996:We could count the total number of pages equivalent to roughly 26 million pages.This is the Web in 2013, almost 10 years, ago:There are more than 30 trillion pages, so many that it's actually impossible to count them anymore, in fact, Google stopped counting them already in 2008 as they admitted in a public post:\"We don't index every one of those trillion pages -- many of them are similar to each other, or represent auto-generated content\"Google, 2008If you were under the impression that Google was indexing the whole Web, well now you know, it gave up 15 years ago. How to stand out in search results?Let's take a step further: a year later in 2009, Tim Berners Lee, the creator of the Web, gave a speed at TED and he said:\"They're much more than [...] initial website that we started off with. Now, I want you to put your data on the web. Turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential.\"Tim Berners-Lee at TED 2009https://www.youtube.com/embed/OM6XIICm_qoHe also gave us a 5 stars system to score our data:5 stars Open DataData should be on the Web of course.It should be readable by machines, not interpreted by humans.It should use non proprietary formats (prefer CSV instead of Excel).Better yet make use of formats that can describe reality using sentences, e.g. JSON-LD.But the most important of all, data must have a unique permanent URL that can be used to reference other data or to be referenced from other data, for example this is our unique and permanent id on DBpedia: http://dbpedia.org/resource/WordLift and on Wikidata: http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q31998763.What is schema.org?2 years later, in 2011, schema.org is born as a joint initiative of Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo (and later on Yandex) to define a common shared vocabulary to describe entities and with the specific aim to \"improve query results relevance\" (schema.org presentation, 2011).In fact, the schema.org FAQ elaborates more on that explaining that \"when search engines see more of the markup they need, users will end up with better search results\" and that \"schema.org helps you to surface your content more clearly or more prominently in search results\" (schema.org FAQ).So let's glue the pieces together:The web is way to big to be fully indexed.Tim Berners Lee is telling us to put our data on the web to unlock the full potential of the Web.The major search engines created a shared vocabulary with the clear intent of improving the search relevance.If you want to know more about structured data and how to implement it on your website, read the article. Why I need a Knowledge Graph in SEO?Just a few months after schema.org was created, Amit Singhal, at the time SVP of Engineering at Google shared an important post that changed the game: Introducing the Knowledge Graph: things, not strings.And he said, and I quote:\"Take a query like [taj mahal]. For more than four decades, search has essentially been about matching keywords to queries. To a search engine, the words [taj mahal] have been just that\u2014two words.\"\"But we all know that [taj mahal] has a much richer meaning.

Instead, entity-based SEO uses context, not just keywords, to help users find what they're looking for.&nbsp;An entity-based SEO platform makes your content more readable for Google and search engines. It takes content and, through structured data, enriches it with the information that search engines need to understand what you're talking about and to be more accurate in their results.&nbsp;As defined by Google, an entity is \u201cA thing or concept that is singular, unique, well-defined and distinguishable.\u201d In the Semantic Web, entities help computers understand everything you know about a person, an organization, or a place mentioned in a document. The entities and the links between them constitute the Knowledge Graph that allows search engines to scan your website effectively.&nbsp;Using an entity-based platform allows you to get more organic traffic and better rankings on Google and search engines. Not only that, the enriched results give users relevant information that improves their experience and leads them to choose your business over competitors. Moreover, in the continuous evolution of the way people search, enriched results promote discovering new content and products that may interest the user.&nbsp;Are WordLift and InLinks alternative solutions?Both WordLift and InLinks are entity-based SEO platforms. But they have differences.\u00a0InLinks provides information (definitions, related topics, people also asking) to help SEOs and editorial teams create new content and optimize existing content according to the trends of each specific target market. The tool analyzes your web pages and suggests what you can optimize and what topics to cover to enrich more people, based on SERPs analysis and competitors and how they are ranking high and use those topics. For each topic, it provides you with detailed information that can help you write the content: definitions, related topics, and frequently asked questions, and it builds a knowledge base. This solution helps you define a more effective content strategy, achieving greater visibility on Google and search engines.&nbsp;In addition, InLinks optimizes internal links and makes it easier to manage them. You can select the ones that best suit your content, choose the best anchor text and add them to your content. You need to copy and paste a Javascript code into your website to automate this implementation.\u00a0Finally, InLinks automates the markup schema to make the pages of your site understandable to search engines by linking the entities in your web pages to the Google Knowledge Graph.&nbsp;&nbsp;https://youtu.be/hLMvlhJm8WQIntroduction to InLinksWordLift helps your website speak Google's native language by converting your content into a format easily understood by search engines: structured data.Using Natural Language Processing and AI, WordLift analyses your content and identifies the most relevant topics for your business, organizing them into entities. Each entity describes an idea, concept, person, or place you are talking about on your website. The entities are stored in a vocabulary. But WordLift goes deeper. It relates the entities in your vocabulary and turns the information into linked data, creating a Knowledge Graph.The Knowledge Graph is the infrastructure behind your content that makes it understandable to Google and search engines on the one hand. It makes your information well contextualized and relevant, on the other hand. This makes your website rank better on search engines, and at the same time, users spend more time on your website. Showing your website high in the search results and offering users relevant information makes them spend more time on your website.To use WordLift, you don't need technical skills, and you don't need the intervention of developers to copy and paste code on your website. Once you have installed the plug-in, WordLift does everything automatically for you.&nbsp;[jwp-video n=\"1\"]How WordLift and InLinks workWordLift analyzes your content, finds and suggests to you the words representing the main concepts, facts, persons, and places mentioned in the text. These words are entities and you can decide and select the entities that better describe the essential meaning of your content between those words. With just one click, those entities will be translated into schema.org markup, and, at the same time, they will be saved into your internal vocabulary. With entities and links between them, WordLift builds your customized Knowledge Graph, turning your website's data into linked data.&nbsp;The Knowledge Graph is the dynamic infrastructure that makes your content smarter. This way, they are understandable to search engines and provide relevant information to users looking for businesses like yours. So you can get more organic traffic to your website and increase user engagement.&nbsp;Not only this. With WordLift, you can use widgets to enrich your content and enable users to discover new content on topics that interest them.&nbsp;Learn more about content recommendation widgets by watching this video.&nbsp;The Knowledge Graph can be integrated straight into your CMS where you\u2019re used to creating and managing your content. No matter what type of CMS you use, APIs and webhooks are provided to integrate it with your own CMS.&nbsp;In addition, if you have an online store, with WordLift you can add structured data to your e-commerce site and build a customized Product Knowledge Graph. It's a new way of storing, organizing, and linking products in your store that allows Google and search engines to better understand your products, their features, and intended use. This way, your products will get more visibility on search engines and a higher rank. Also, with WordLift you can add structured data to your product feed and sell your products on Google Shopping for free.&nbsp;You can use WordLift directly on your website without any technical skills.&nbsp;InLinks analyzes the pages of your website, detects the main topics, and suggests to you how to optimize your content based on them. The list of main topics, called entities, is the result of the analysis of SERPs and content of your competitors that already have a good ranking on Google and search engines.&nbsp;By selecting the entities most relevant to your content, InLinks provides you with detailed information to go deep on each topic, making your content understandable to search engines. Also, by associating each page with its respective entity, InLinks creates a structure of internal links. To automate its implementation, you'll need to copy and paste JavaScript code into your website.&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, by connecting your content to the Google Knowledge Graph, InLinks adds schema markup to your web pages, increasing your SEO strategy.&nbsp;#1 Plus: WordLift\u2019s Knowledge GraphSimplifying, we could say that the Knowledge Graph is a vast database where information is organized and related. Thus, the main benefit of a Knowledge Graph is that it allows you to contextualize and connect large amounts of data in a perfectly understandable way for all types of machines.As we all know, Google has its Knowledge Graph. But not only Google: all tech giants have developed similar technologies to manage data better internally and, at the same time, communicate more efficiently with search engines, thus achieving greater organic visibility.WordLift allows you to create your own Knowledge Graph. In other words, WordLift connects the markup schema of your pages with the database that search engines use to understand your online content.Just as your sitemap.html shows Google the most important pages within your site, WordLift creates a kind of semantic sitemap or map of meanings and relationships. The result will then be a network of connections that helps define every concept, person, product, or another type of entity presented on your website, allowing Google to interpret and index them perfectly.[et_pb_section global_module=\"12650\"][/et_pb_section]#2 Plus: WordLift improves the UX of your websiteWordLift\u2019s widgets leverage the data contained in your Knowledge Graph to improve engagement on your site, thus marrying SEO and User Experience.It does this through internal links, widgets, and context cards: thanks to these features, you can double the time spent on each page by users and the pages consulted per session in a few days!Data visualization widgets (such as maps and timelines) and widgets dedicated to recommended content will allow you to improve users\u2019 experience on your web pages and push them to explore more pages, and increase time spent on the site.And now, let\u2019s understand better what we\u2019re talking about!Above, you can see the Faceted Search, a widget for suggesting other content to your users that might interest them. WordLift selects each piece of content based on the entities mentioned on the page.&nbsp;Another super helpful feature for improving engagement is WordLift Geomap, which creates a custom map linked to your content.If you have an e-commerce, you might find the related products widget \u2013 included in our e-commerce extension. Also, in this case, WordLift itself will suggest to you a selection of products based on semantic connections.#3 Plus: WordLift's Automatic SummarizationThanks to its artificial intelligence and, more specifically, the so-called NLP, WordLift allows you to summarize your contents in a few lines. This function generates an extract that WordLift uses in various ways:To add the schema.org property description;To create interactive context cards that are activated when you mouse over internal links;To suggest an automatic Excerpt that WordPress uses where the template requires it.Want to know more?

        "text": "Building A Knowledge Graph-Based Chatbot When we think of bots, we either think of Star-Wars-like robots or humanoid androids communicating with us.What are chatbots? Chatbots are computer programs built to communicate with humans using natural language. Usually, they handle customer service tasks, such as answering questions and booking appointments.The primary purpose of chatbot systems is to retrieve valuable and relevant information from one or multiple knowledge bases by using natural language understanding (NLU) and semantic web technologies.&nbsp;The problemThe web is packed with the most disparate information; it's often hard for humans to classify and judge the quality of a source at first sight, so, in order to save time, which is our most valuable asset, we turn to machines to do the searching for us.Technically speakingMany chatbot systems are designed to require a lot of training data, which is unavailable and expensive to create. Recently, with the growth development of linked data, increasing progress on chatbots has been seen in research and industry. However, they face many challenges, including user query understanding, intent classification, multilingual aspect, multiple knowledge bases, and analytical queries interpretation.Knowledge graphs are becoming more and more a standard technology for Companies, people, and publishers. A Knowledge-Graph-based bot is scalable, flexible, and dynamic.Why Knowledge GraphsA Knowledge Graph is a structure that portrays information as relationships and concepts connected to each other. Google was the first to mention Knowledge Graphs and the technology behind them back in 2012.&nbsp;You can find out more about why you need a Knowledge Graph, read our blog post.Back to us now!So we know that a chatbot needs a domain model in order to understand and answer user questions. In machine learning, we would generate a huge knowledge base of sentences and use cases, wasting time and resulting in a static chatbot, which the web is full of already.Since a domain model collects information about a particular topic or subject, we can use a Knowledge Graph to store and retrieve information easily.In this way, our chatbot would be dynamic and always up to date without manually adding and editing the knowledge base.Advantages of Knowledge Graph-Based ChatbotsA chatbot based on a Knowledge Graph knows how to interpret requests from the users delivering meaningful answers straight away. Moreover, there won't be a need for lengthy training.&nbsp;Knowledge Graphs can be updated more efficiently simply by adding data and relationships to other entities.How To Develop A Knowledge-Based ChatbotFirst of all, there is the preparatory work for the Knowledge Graph, in which there should be a clear structure of concepts, entities, and relationships between them.Then, the chatbot needs to \"study\" those rules, entities, and relations to answer questions.These are three main flows that describe how to develop a conversational interface based on a Knowledge Graph:&nbsp;Pushing contents from the Knowledge Graph (KG) to the website/backend (via GraphQL interface) - the data present in the KG are made available through targeted queries.Semantic content search on questions-answers (via search API) - the FAQ content is made available through targeted queries that can be consulted performing semantic search, which allows you to manage, if present, the intent associated with specific questions.Natural language understanding and dialogue management (via NLU for intent management) - the KG data and the semantic search functions are operated by an external dialogue manager application that intercepts the user's intent and retrieves the answers (accessing content either in the KG or from semantic search).Knowledge Graph and GraphQLThe Knowledge Graph is fed with content flows from the CMS and through the NLP end-point, which analyzes the unstructured contents and organizes them semantically using the Company's vocabulary containing the key concepts (entities).The graph may contain different content types: FAQpages, NewsArticles, Articles, Offers\u2026 all useful to sustain a conversation flow that includes different nuances on the same topic, as a user might want to know a definition of a term or articles related to this term.GraphQL is a query language and execution engine designed to implement API-based solutions that access information in the Knowledge Graph.We use GraphQL as a query service, and its functions are available for data consultation only. Reading takes place through a different end-point.GraphQL is used when users want to see all articles related to a topic.Requests towards GraphQL are executed in the Knowledge Graph via authentication.Semantic SearchThis module integrates the API for semantic search to the knowledge base. A first usage scenario is based on the FAQ content present on the site today.Later, it will be possible to extend the scope of use of this feature to all web content in the KG through the use of models for open-domain question answering (ODQA).The search for answers (/ ask)The answers to user questions are extracted through a semantic content search system.This way, we can enable a classification algorithm that uses a transformer-based neural network to classify questions based on how \"significant\" they are in relation to the user's query.The use case is based on the following application flow:The dialogue manager (NLU) identifies an intent that can be satisfied by FAQ contentThe user's question is delivered to the Search APIThe Search API identifies the closest question-answerThe result is sent to the dialogue manager (NLU)The dialogue manager via ECSS sends the response to the end-userUnderstanding of natural language and dialogue managementWe use a scalable architecture: the two main components are natural language understanding (NLU - Natural Language Understanding) and a dialogue management platform.NLU deals with managing the classification of intentions, the extraction of entities, and the recovery of responses. In the diagram, it is represented as an NLU pipeline because it processes user expressions using an NLU model generated by the trained pipeline.The dialogue management component determines the following action in a conversation based on context (the Dialogue Policies indicated in the diagram).ConclusionsKnowledge Graphs are very powerful databases to develop a conversational marketing strategy, and when it comes to building a conversational interface, they stand out from other technologies in terms of:SpeedPowerful interrelationships between concepts&nbsp;Flexibility&nbsp;Possibility to easily update the graphEmbed potentially unlimited knowledge&nbsp;The goal of any bot is to provide valuable and relevant information to users, adapting to each context and request. And that\u2019s what Knowledge Graphs do: they move and adjust.In a world of infinite information, be the KG-powered bot![et_pb_section global_module=\"20972\"][/et_pb_section][wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "Web Scraping for SEO Web scraping is the magical act of extracting information from a web page. You can do it on one page or millions of pages. There are multiple reasons why scraping is essential in SEO:We might use it for auditing a websiteWe might need it in the context of programmatic SEO&nbsp;We could use it for providing context to our web analyticsHere at WordLift, we primarily focus on structured data and improving the data quality of content knowledge graphs. We depend on crawling to cope with missing and messy data on various use cases.&nbsp;Extracting Structured Data from Web Pages using Large Language ModelsRecently, I\u2019ve been exploring the potential of&nbsp;OpenAI function calling&nbsp;for&nbsp;extracting structured data from web pages. This could be a game-changer for those who, like us, are actively looking to synergize Large Language Models (#LLMs) with Knowledge Graphs (#KGs).Why is this exciting? Because the integration of LLMs with KGs is fast becoming a hot topic in tech, and developing a unified framework that can enrich both LLMs and KGs simultaneously is of significant importance.By using this&nbsp;Colab Notebook, you can extract entity attributes from a list of URLs - even from&nbsp; pages built in JavaScript! I used in this implementation the&nbsp;schema for LodgingBusiness&nbsp;(hotels, b&amp;b and resorts).A few lessons learned from this exploration:We can seamlessly extract data from webpages using LLMs.It\u2019s wise to continue using existing scraping techniques where possible. For instance, BeautifulSoup is excellent for scraping titles and meta descriptions.Using LLMs is slow and expensive, so optimizing the process is key.After extraction, it\u2019s crucial to thoroughly check and validate the data to ensure its accuracy and reliability. Data integrity is paramount!The code is open for modifications and adaptations to suit your needs and can be integrated with the&nbsp;AutoScraper&nbsp;introduced in this article. Developed by Alireza Mika, it makes your web scraping fast, simple, and fun. All the credit goes to him for bringing innovation to a sector that isn\u2019t evolving as fast as you think.&nbsp;AutoScraper - the new kid on the blockIf you are interested in using the library in Python, I suggest you read Ali\u2019s blog post on Medium.&nbsp;I found this tool very powerful, yet limited to only some use-cases, and I decided to build a simple Streamlit web application that you can immediately use.&nbsp;Jump to the web application here \ud83c\udf88Here is how the scraping app works&nbsp;You provide the URL of the web page used as a template. I am using a product page on our E-commerce demo site as a reference.You add a list of information (comma separated) that you expect to scrape from that page. Here you can add anything, a snippet of text, the URL of an image, or the structured data property present in the markup. I am adding the title, the price, and the SKU in this example.You finally hit \u201cTrain\u201d and let AutoScraper learn to extract these attributes from similar pages.You can choose to let AutoScraper run under the assumption that all pages will be the same (choose \u201cexact\u201d) or that they will have a similar structure (choose \u201csimilar\u201d instead).&nbsp;You can now add a list of pages that you would like to scrape. I have added two samples here. Keep in mind that there is a limit to the total number of characters that you can add (and therefore to the total number of URLs that you can scrape).  This is a demonstration tool and shall be used only for a limited set of pages.&nbsp;Voil\u00e0 the work is done, and you can now download a CSV containing, for each URL, price, SKU, and product name.How to refine the resultsIn some cases, we might get false positives; in other words, AutoScraper might extract data that we don\u2019t need. In these cases, we\u2019ll need to revise the set of rules that have been identified and keep just what we need. Let\u2019s review an example.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we add the URL of the image behind the reference product in the list of attributes that want to extract, we will get a table with an unneeded column (column 4).We can now refine the rules by clicking on the \u201cRefine Results\u201d button. Here we can see that if we remove rule_zk7p and hit \u201cCrawl\u201d again, we now have the correct table without column 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Existing limitationsThis is a demonstrative web app. The UI is a bit clunky when you start refining rules, and in general, it is limited to crawling only a few URLs. If you are looking for something that scales, I would recommend Advertools, a well-known python library developed by the mythical Elias Dabbas. If you want to see how you can use it, watch this webinar. Here, Elias Dabbas and Doreid Haddad show how to build a Knowledge Graph using Advertools and WordLift. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwlhuUcYJMI[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]Is web scraping illegal?No, web scraping is, generally, legal, which is why commercial search engines exist. However, there are some considerations to be made:Some websites might have terms and conditions that do not allow scraping;Technically speaking, scraping is a task that consumes a significant amount of bandwidth and computational resources. We shall do it only when it is needed. Google itself is reviewing its indexing policies to be more environmentally friendly; we should do it too.How we use the extracted data makes a huge difference.

        "text": "PPC Pay per click (PPC), also called cost per click, is an internet advertising model used to direct traffic to websites, in which advertisers pay the publisher (typically a website owner) when the ad is clicked. It is defined simply as \u201cthe amount spent to get an advertisement clicked.\u201d With search engines, advertisers typically bid on keyword phrases relevant to their target market. Content sites commonly charge a fixed price per click rather than use a bidding system. PPC \"display\" advertisements, also known as \"banner\" ads, are shown on web sites or search engine results with related content that have agreed to show ads. In contrast to the generalized portal, which seeks to drive a high volume of traffic to one site, PPC implements the so-called affiliate model, which provides purchase opportunities wherever people may be surfing. It does this by offering financial incentives (in the form of a percentage of revenue) to affiliated partner sites. The affiliates provide purchase-point click-through to the merchant. It is a pay-for-performance model: If an affiliate does not generate sales, it represents no cost to the merchant. Variations include banner exchange, pay-per-click, and revenue sharing programs. Websites that utilize PPC ads will display an advertisement when a keyword query matches an advertiser's keyword list, or when a content site displays relevant content. Such advertisements are called sponsored links or sponsored ads, and appear adjacent to, above, or beneath organic results on search engine results pages, or anywhere a web developer chooses on a content site. The PPC advertising model is open to abuse through click fraud, although Google and others have implemented automated systems to guard against abusive clicks by competitors or corrupt web developers.",

        "text": "SEO In The Metaverse: What We Can Learn From Computer Vision And Video Table of contents:The Metaverse EraOverview of advancements in visual searchWhat are the top video ranking factors? What do other SEO professionals think?The need for open, actionable, scientific research in the SEO industryConnecting computer vision, images and video - the Swiss raclette experimentYou only look once (YOLO) algorithm - an experiment with Google\u2019s Martin Splitt SEO mythbusting seriesThe need for the 3DModel schema markupAdvanced Custom FieldsThe connection to the MetaverseOnline marketers spent the last 2, 3 decades optimizing readers\u2019 content and enhancing the appropriate mix of keywords and entities so that online audiences can find them whenever they are offering products, services or informational content to educate their readers on their business. Every year, there are plenty of Google update algorithms that are raising the SEO bar and they are making it harder to meet the constantly evolving demanding standards that online searchers have.However, if we are carefully looking at what is ahead of us and what will be trending in the future, we can see that the online marketing world is slowly changing. We are definitely witnessing the rise of web3 and going more towards creating in the universe of interconnected metaverses. It seems that the new goal will be to focus on \u201cgetting found in the metaverse world\u201d - a bet that Facebook also did by rebranding their whole company to Meta. Seoul\u2019s government also proceeded with a plan to develop a national metaverse platform in order to raise the city's global competitiveness and Dubai also announced similar plans.Therefore, the question is: how can we use our knowledge from computer vision and video optimization to make the metaverse world SEO-friendly? How to make a successful blend of synergies in order to develop new advanced strategies that will solve the need to be understood by users and search engines in this newly created metaverse world? Current Advancements On The Topic Of Visual SearchGenerative AI has definitely revolutionized computer vision but current models are still facing multiple challenges: typical vision datasets are costly because they require teaching the model of a narrow set of visual concepts, so this will pose a challenge in optimizing for the metaverse world too. In addition, standard vision models are good at performing one task but only one and require a lot of effort to develop new learnings.One of the most advanced solutions there is the neural network called CLIP. CLIP (Contrastive Language Image Pre-training) is trained on a wide spectrum of images and natural language supervision that is available on the Internet. Another advancement is the model DALL-E, a neural network which creates images from text captions for a wide range of concepts that are expressible in natural language. As it\u2019s noted on DALL-E\u2019s website, it \u201crepresents a 12-billion parameter version of GPT3 trained to generate images from text descriptions using a dataset of text-image pairs\u201d.We performed some experiments with DALL-E in the past - here\u2019s an image we created by using this neural network:What Are The Top Video Ranking Factors? What Do Other SEO Professionals Think?I spoke at SMX Munich 2023 a few days ago and asked the audience to tell me the most important factors for video ranking. We agreed on the following things:The length of the video (this is useful because we need to classify whether it is a longer video or a video that belongs to YouTube Shorts);The description of the video (to determine if it is worth watching before you actually invest time in it);The design (because home screens help users move from the general product listing page - the list of videos for a particular search term - to a specific videoAnd so on.If you already know me, you know that I am a very research-oriented person and a business-oriented computer engineer specializing in content engineering and end-to-end SEO. With that in mind, it makes sense to see what Google patents are hinting at on this topic.I managed to find 2 patents related to video ranking optimization:\"Popular media items dataset with exponential decay\" by Google Research/Inc.\"Page ranking system employing user sharing data\" - a combined work by Google researchers/employees and the University of Maryland.The first patent suggests that more engagement means better ranking and we can observe this from the following evidence excerpts:\"\u2026means for determining a user engagement value for the media item based on at least one user shares of the media item, user indications of interest in the media item, user comments on the media item\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026A score for a media item is computed by determining a plurality of positive user actions associated with the media, combining a plurality of score contributions from the plurality of positive user actions to determine a value for the score, and applying an exponential decay to the value for the score. The media items are ranked based on the scores\u2026\u201d.While the second patent does not explicitly cover the topic of videos, it does provide some interesting insights for us. For example, we can see from the following excerpt that embedding videos can lead to better rankings: \"\u2026A user can thereby be presented with relevant search results ranked by or incorporating content sharing data, such as how often the content has been shared, and possibly in conjunction with other ranking data (internal and/or external reference).\"But what if I decide to IGNORE all the known SEO video ranking tips that the world knows about? How will I rank my video then?The Need For Open, Actionable, Scientific Research In The SEO IndustryWhen we talk about case studies and research in the SEO industry, we really need to think about how we want to conduct research in a scientific framework:Point out previous effortsUse a scientific methodology to set up the exploration and the opportunity to gain new insightsShare the exact processes, tools, and algorithms that were used in the experimentShow the results, show their statistical significanceDiscuss findings and future workI practice what I preach, and so I published my dissertation \"Content Engineering for SEO Digital Strategies by using NLP and ML\" in IEEE, one of the most prestigious journals for computer science and engineering. I will use this knowledge from my previous research activities and my knowledge of computer vision for this experiment to better explain my current work.Where Is Computer Vision Headed?When comparing the NLP field with the computer vision field, we can notice that we already established the foundational models for NLP: we have models trained on tons of parameters like BERT, transformers, GPT2 or GPT3, so that people can adapt them for their specific applications and domain. However, it is worth noting that these NLP models can be unsatisfactory because they don't possess domain knowledge.Making foundational computer vision models is a priority for computer vision scientists, just like in the NLP field. Andrew Ng says that \u201che believes we will see something similar in computer vision. \u201cMany people have been pre-training on ImageNet for many years now,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the gradual trend will be to pre-train on larger and larger data sets, increasingly on unlabeled data sets rather than just labeled datasets, and increasingly a little bit more on video rather than just images.\u201d \u201dConnecting Computer Vision, Images And Video - Swiss Raclette ExperimentComputers are able to perform object detection and image recognition in both images and videos. By using computer vision, we can break things in visuals down into pixels and then perform matching based on this information.At WordLift, we believe that marketing is a generous act that helps others achieve their goals and an opportunity to serve. For this reason, we are sharing this experiment with you. We used this knowledge about object detection, speech recognition and knowledge about Google\u2019s abilities to even understand certain environments (like restaurants) and movements in video to create a half-a-minute long video sequence of Swiss raclettes, a satisfying collection of different servings found on Instagram. All of the videos were carefully handpicked by using the hashtag #swissraclette. Some of the criteria used to pick them are considering the following factors:Having a clear picture of the ingredients;Showing different ingredients from multiple angles;\u201cRestaurant sounds\u201d like knives, forks and so on;Different sizes of the meal servings shown together.Once we created the whole video, it was uploaded directly on YouTube, having the following title \u201cSwiss Raclette - Satisfying compilation of Melting Cheese (Potatoes, Bread, Onions, Cucumbers, Meat)\u201d. In order to eliminate the effect of other types of video and image optimization, we decided to leave them aside and just post the video, hoping that the algorithm will pick up all the cues that we\u2019ve architected in the video sequence and use this knowledge to recommend videos further. Therefore, we have the following situation:No tags;No synonyms for swiss racletteNever had a history of channel advertising in any wayNo embedsNo schema markupNo linksThe URL and the slug were defined by GoogleNo link depthMy channel and personal region did not overlap with SwitzerlandNo comments;No shares;No description;No campaign;No likes or other user signals;No language setting;No captions;No start or end screens;Undefined location;Not having an established youtube fan base that cares about swiss raclette;The video is not even in a playlist.We implemented the following things: Architected video frames, set up a OK filename (swiss-raclette.mp4), verified the host, defined a quality title with thematic entities - lemmas, was nearby in Germany during the run of the video, and mainly focused on using my knowledge of computer vision to create the video.Basically, the general approach is to apply computer science and engineering knowledge to video. Cross-functional work, or applying an idea from one field (in this case computer science) to another (marketing) is key to gaining new insights for SEO purposes (new video ranking factors). So I discovered another paper by Google researchers titled \"DOPS: learning to detect 3D objects and predict their 3D shapes\" that pointed me in a new direction. Interesting, I said to myself, this is something I can work with and explore further! The main logic now is to evaluate videos using only 3D object optimization.The results are the following:To this day, we gathered 750+ views and 20+ likes for the video. As you can see from the picture, over 87% of the visits came as a result of search features, like suggested videos, search, browse features and YouTube shorts. It is clear that architecting visual frames works and smart environment setup is the content optimization for videos and metaverse worlds in future.This is important to understand because we have full control on our content creation process. You cannot re-optimize video or 3D environments once you create it or write a better description for ranking - Google will ignore them right away or will over time.Ideally, everyone should tend to build stuff that will last. It is cheaper to architect the 3D environment beforehand v.s. bringing the whole team to produce a new video or platform and advertise it all over from scratch.You Only Look Once (YOLO) Algorithm - An Experiment With Google\u2019s Martin Splitt SEO Mythbusting SeriesOne of the main challenges in computer vision is to pick the right model for experimenting. Having achieved solid results in the previous experiment, just by carefully architecting handpicked videos for visual sequence creation, we decided to pick another video which is full of objects and perform object detection by using the YOLO algorithm.You only look once (YOLO) is a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system. The pre-trained model of the convolutional neural network is able to detect pre-trained classes including the data set from VOC and COCO, or you can also create a network with your own detection objects. We chose this model because it\u2019s fairly simple to experiment with and it is relatively easy to develop the script for the experiment.Using the COCO dataset (large-scale detection of Common Objects in Context), YOLO can detect the 80 COCO object classes like person, dining table, cell phone, laptop, TV, chair, sofa, bed, clock, book and so on. When processing multiple visual frames, it is useful to use an algorithm which will detect duplicate frames and remove them from the frames that need to be analyzed. A good solution for this is the Image Deduplicator algorithm developed by the engineering team at Idealo GmbH - a python package that easies the task of finding exact or near duplicate images in an image dataset.The image recognition script is fairly simple: you need to download the pre-trained model yoloh5 (Hierarchical Data Format) and upload it to your Google Drive and set the path to the model. You will need to upload the video that you want to analyze before running the analysis. We decided to analyze 20 frames per second - please note that even a 3 minute video can contain many video frames and require some processing time in order to be done. In our case, it took us around 1 hour to tag the object in the video and produce the final output. Here\u2019s how the script looks like:!pip install imageai!sudo add-apt-repository ppa:deadsnakes/ppa!sudo apt-get update!sudo apt-get install python3.8!sudo apt install python3.8-distutils!sudo apt install python3.8-venv python3.8-dev!sudo apt-get install python3-pip!python3.8 -m pip install -U pip setuptools!pip install tensorflow==2.4.1!pip install keras==2.4from imageai.Detection import VideoObjectDetectionimport osdef forFrame(frame_number, output_array, output_count, detected_frame):    print(\"FOR FRAME \", frame_number)    print(\"Output for each object : \", output_array)    print(\"Output count for unique objects : \", output_count)    print(\"Returned Objects is : \", type(detected_frame))print(\"------------END OF A FRAME --------------\")execution_path = os.getcwd()print(execution_path)detector = VideoObjectDetection()detector.setModelTypeAsYOLOv3()detector.setModelPath(os.path.join(execution_path, \"/content/drive/MyDrive/yolo.h5\"))detector.loadModel()video_path = detector.detectObjectsFromVideo(    input_file_path=\"/content/drive/MyDrive/video_name.mp4\", # enter the full path here    output_file_path=\"/content/drive/MyDrive/result.mp4\"    , frames_per_second=20, log_progress=True, return_detected_frame=True, minimum_percentage_probability=50,    per_frame_function=forFrame)print(video_path)The link to the script can be found here. It is important to understand that this is not what Google's algorithms look like exactly but still, we are trying to mimic its strategy for object recognition by using existing state-of-the-art techniques that are well-known in the computer vision world.Phase 2We chose the video of Google\u2019s Developer Advocate Martin Split, speaking at \u201cSEO Mythbusting Is Back - Official Trailer (Season 2)\u201d because it\u2019s object rich and a perfect candidate to test the video Instance segmentation procedure.As we can see from the screenshots, the YOLO algorithm classifies Martin\u2019s hair as an apple and some of the objects are incorrectly marked up to represent a car or a person. The confidence score that the object detection process is performed correctly is over 50%. Manual observation shows that this is certainly not true when observing the video.Conclusion: object detection is challenging, especially if the computer vision model is not trained on a diverse image dataset that represents the same objects but from different angles, postures and positions.We can also try to take a similar approach using the Google Vision API and their Vision Intelligence API. If we take an example image from our Youtube video for Swiss Raclette, we can observe that the algorithm is able to detect that we have food, ingredients and Gruyere cheese, which is wrong (this is a different cheese compared to Raclette cheese). However, we are still on a good path, because Google \"understands\" that we are dealing with the topic of Swiss cheese in general.Some other interesting algorithms to try out:Object Detection: YOLO, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet.Image Segmentation: Mask R-CNN, U-Net, DeepLabv3+.Optical Flow: Farneback, Lucas-Kanade.Action Recognition: Two-Stream Convolutional Networks, Temporal Segment Networks (TSN), 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D-CNN).General Video Analysis: Keyframe Extraction, Video Summarization.Object Tracking: KCF, Deep SORT, GOTURN.The Need For The 3DModel Schema MarkupThe experiments we performed are clearly indicating that even when we use advanced algorithms like YOLO, there\u2019s still a space for the objects to be incorrectly labeled in visual environments like videos and metaverse spaces (virtual reality and augmented reality platforms). Having this in mind, we need to find a more structured way of providing 3D information to search engines.That is where structured data markup like the 3DModel schema comes into play. When using structured data like this, you help Google understand the content of your site and enable specific search result features for your webpages. 3DModel schema requires the following properties:@type: 3DModelname: the name of your item.encoding: this property is a list and must contain your 3D assets (or MediaObject)In addition, the required properties for each 3D object or MediaObject are the following:@type: MediaObjectcontentUrl: The URL to your 3D objectencodingFormat: the encoding formatAn example of 3DModel schema markup can look like this:&lt;script type=\"application/ld+json\"&gt; { \"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\", \"@type\":\"3DModel\", \"image\":\"\", \"name\":\"Muscle\", \"encoding\":&#091; { \"@type\":\"MediaObject\", \"contentUrl\":\"https://link_to_your_content_no1\", \"encodingFormat\":\"model/gltf-binary\" }, { \"@type\":\"MediaObject\", \"contentUrl\":\"https:/link_to_your_content_no1\", \"encodingFormat\":\"model/vnd.usdz+zip\" } ] } &lt;/script&gt;We can use this information to create an automated way for you to apply this schema on multiple pages on your website by using WordLift\u2019s mappings and advanced custom fields.Advanced Custom FieldsWhen dealing with multiple schemas, it is good to have a tool which can do the initial mapping and then use the newly created schema to apply it to new use cases. This is exactly what our tool does - identify your schema markup type (Course, LocalBusiness, Location, Store, Service, whatever it is, in our case it\u2019s the 3DModel schema markup), define its attributes, markup the optional and required fields, confirm the mapping and then apply this created schema with the defined rules to upcoming specific use cases that follow the same schema type that you created before. Ideally, you would like to use properties that are general to most use cases and not overly specific to a particular use-case in order to make the specific schema markup reusable.By using schema markup, we\u2019re communicating to the search engines about what type of content we are using in a machine-readable way. This is an important step in the process since dealing with unstructured data like text, images or video is sometimes hard to debunk, as we saw in our previous experiments. It\u2019s beneficial to have a JSON-alike object to explain what is happening out there in a more structured way. The final creation can be tested by using the Google Structured Data Testing tool.The Connection To The Metaverse3D is the key component for search, but also a solid foundation for future generative AI apps and the metaverse. \"The things you create, grow and earn in the Metaverse will be yours. And more importantly, you will be able to monetize them. There will be a huge incentive for creators to be present and create in this space\".When we talk about the metaverse, the first thing we have to think about is the objectverse: you'll be able to define a 3D object that you want to use, pull it from some kind of database, expand it or shrink it, and throw it into the room to start creating it. \"We can now use generative AI for images. We can do it for videos. At the rate it's going, you'll be able to create entire villages, 3D villages, landscapes, cities and so on. You'll be able to put together a sample image and create an entire 3D world\". It has never been more exciting to be part of the Metaverse and 3D SEO as a whole!The key takeaway is that we can rank videos just by using a 3D optimization approach. What I also like about this strategy is that it is:Scaleable: you do it once but it is applicable to all 3D understanding platforms like video platforms and multiverses that employ algorithms to understand what 3D content is about;Harder to reverse engineer: because we don't have dedicated SEO software to help us figure out how to outrank our competition;Harder to replicate: we need creative storytelling and enough resources to be able to do it on our side properly;Usually overlooked and lacking strategy from the management: nobody speaks about 3D optimization or video optimization in an advanced way.Take a look at the presentation I gave at SMX Munich 2023 \ud83d\udc47https://speakerdeck.com/meemi93/architecting-3d-content-what-video-structuring-can-teach-us-about-the-metaverse-seo-an-experiment[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

Let's review a practical example.Original(detail) Nearest Neighborhood(detail) Super ResolutionAs seen from the picture above we\u2019ll start from a single low resolution image (original) and we will upscale it to obtain a super resolution image that preserves the original details.This is done&nbsp; by leveraging the ability of the ESRGAN neural network to hallucinate details by using previously learned information.In other words, to replace the missing details, the network will make its guess on what pixel will go in what position. This is possible as the model has been trained on the pixel mapping between low-resolution and high-resolution images. It is worth mentioning that by simply downsizing the resolution of images we can easily build a training dataset for this purpose.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KULkSwLk62IIn this tutorial we will run inference on an existing pre-trained model for image enhancing.Why Do We Need Hi-Resolution Images In SEO?While it is common to discuss the importance of image compression in SEO, it is less frequent to discuss why we need to boost the resolution of images.&nbsp;Learn more about SEO image optimization, see our latest web story\ud83e\udd29Image Compression in SEOImages represent in general 22.8% (mobile) and 15.5% (desktop) of the total page weight on most websites according to the http archive.Therefore compressing images greatly improves the user experience and it is an important practice to follow.There are tons of things that you can do to reduce the size of an image. In this workflow we will use Pillow (PIL), a well-known open source imaging library for Python, that allows us to open, manipulate, and optimize images in bulk. More about PIL and bulk SEO image optimization can be found here \ud83d\udc47.&nbsp;https://twitter.com/jamesaphoenix12/status/1272805262068498437?ref_src=twsrc%5EtfwImage Optimization For Structured DataImages accompanying content though, whether we deal with news articles, recipes or products are a strategic element in modern SEO and often an overlooked one.&nbsp;Large images, in multiple formats (1:1, 4:3 and 16:9) are needed by Google to present content into carousels, tabs (rich results across multiple devices) and Google Discover. This is done using structured data and by following a few important recommendations:&nbsp;Make sure to have at least one image for every content piece.Ensure that images can be crawled and indexed by Google (it seems obvious but it is not).Make sure that images are representative of the marked up content (you don\u2019t want to feature an image of roasted pork for a vegetarian recipe \ud83d\ude48).Use a supported file format (here is the list of file formats supported by Google Images).Provide multiple high-resolution images that have a minimum amount of pixels in total (when multiplying one size with the other) of:50.000 pixels for Products and Recipes80.000 pixels for News ArticleAdd in structured data the same image in the following aspect ratios: 16x9, 4x3, and 1x1.For every image we want to ensure that additional renditions are generated.To learn more about image optimization for structured data markup I recommend you to read a great article by Barry Adams on optimizing images for News Articles and our checklist to rank for Top Stories. Both articles greatly emphasize on the importance of hi-res images in great detail.Generating Multiple Renditions On The FlyOne nice thing that WordLift does automatically is to create for each and every image, in the structure data markup, the required version in 16x9, 4x3, and 1x1 aspect ratios.&nbsp;You can have a quick look at the markup that WordLift generates for a Product by clicking here. The only requirement for WordLift to automatically generate multiple hi-resolution images is that the original image has enough pixels. This means that, in the ideal scenario, you want to have on the smallest side of the image at least 1.200 pixels.&nbsp;Start Upscaling Your Images For Structured DataSince it might not always be possible to have at least 1.200 pixels on the shortest side I came up with this workflow and here is how it works.&nbsp;The workflow uses a model that has been trained on the DIV2K Dataset (it is made of bicubically downsampled images) on image patches of size 128 x 128. The original paper is authored by Xintao Wang et.al. and builds on top of another seminal paper titled \u201cThe Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN)\u201d by removing unpleasant artifacts that might otherwise accompany the hallucinated details.1. Setting up the environmentThe code is fairly straightforward so I will explain how to use it and a few important details. You can simply run the steps 1 and 2 and start processing your images.Prior to doing that you might want to choose if to compress the produced images and what level of compression to apply. Since we\u2019re working with PNG and JPG formats we will use the optimize=True argument of PIL to decrease the weight of images after their upscaling. This option is configurable as you might have already in place on your website an extension, a CDN or a plugin that automatically compresses any uploaded image.&nbsp;You can choose to disable (the default is set to True) the compression or change the compression level using the form inside the first code block of the Colab (1. Preparing the Environment).&nbsp;2. Loading the filesYou can upload the files that you would like to optimize by either:1. A folder on your local computer2. A list of comma separated image URLsIn both cases you are able to load multiple files and the procedure will keep the original file name so that you can simply push them back on the web server via SFTP.&nbsp;When providing a list of URLs the script will first download all the images in a folder, previously created and called input.Once all images have been downloaded you can run the run_super_res() function on the following block. The function will first download the model from TF Hub and then will start increasing the resolution of all the images x4. The resulting images will be stored (and compressed if the option for compression has been kept to True) in a folder called output.&nbsp;Once completed you can zip all the produced files contained in the output folder by executing the following code block. You can also change the name of the zipped file and eventually remove the output folder (in case you want to run it again).&nbsp;Running The First ExperimentAs usual in SEO there is no learning until you test things out. We witnessed in the past a significant impact on News Article with the proper use of hi-resolution images. This is particularly true when it comes to Google Discover (you can read our checklist to optimize content for Google Discover) or AMP. We can find an explicit reference to the 1.200 px width requirement on Google\u2019s \u201cGet on Google Discover Feed\u201d documentation. So, as a first test, we opted for a recipe website of a happy client of our SEO management service. In this specific implementation compression was already enabled server-side. We therefore set the option COMPRESSION_BOOLEAN=False and uploaded the files back after running the Colab.&nbsp;You can choose to crawl images from any website using your favorite crawler and immediately spot the list of files that would benefit the most from a resolution increase (basically any files that will not meet the 50-80.000 total number of pixels).We began our testing with a first batch containing only a few images. It is important to carefully test the impact of any SEO automation before scaling it to the entire website. We always need to make sure that everything is working as expected.We first checked that we didn\u2019t change the page experience by reviewing the core web vitals, after applying the treatment.&nbsp;In only a few days we could immediately spot the treated urls (recipes where we increased the resolution of the featured image) appearing in the recipe carousels \ud83c\udf89.We are expecting a double digit growth rate on the clicks for the treated urls and I will share the data in the coming days. In the meantime we\u2019re experimenting with the same techniques on other websites to further evaluate the impact of this automation.Conclusion And Future WorkThe optimization of images is an important tactic when dealing with structured data markup. There are already a few Super-Resolution APIs available such as the one provided by DeepAI or the Image Upscaler of ICONS8. They are both paid APIs and they seem to use SRGAN rather than ESRGAN. As we progress with gathering performance data from multiple websites I also plan to add to the code the option required to downsize the image to either 50.000 or 80.000 pixels. As of today you might end up having images that have a larger and unneeded resolution and this could negatively impact the overall page loading experience.&nbsp;Happy upscaling and don\u2019t forget that you can use machine learning also to automatically describe the content of your images as shown in this tutorial \ud83d\udc40.Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat is Super-Resolution?Image Super Resolution is a technique for increasing the resolution of an image from low-resolution (LR) to high-resolution (HR). This can be done by either increasing the number of pixels in the image (for example using the nearest neighborhood algorithm), or by using a technique called super-resolution.Can Super Resolution help in SEO?Yes, increasing the resolution greatly helps SEO for structured data markup. If images don't have a high resolution, Google might not be able to represent the content asset with rich features. This is particularly true for products, news articles, recipes, and the likelihood of being featured on Google Discover.Is It Possible To Increase The True Resolution Of An Image?Given the principle of data inequality, it is impossible to increase the image resolution other than adding additional information into the process. Suppose the original image conveys the information for \"X\" and we encode \"X\" for creating an upscale version of the image. In that case, the resulting information \"Y\" will always be a subset of \"X\". This is the reason why when we use machine learning, we transfer additional information \"Y\u00b9\". This information is what the network gained during its training, making it possible to increase the resolution of an image.&nbsp;[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "How Google Advances In Image And Language Understanding Table of contentsWhat challenges do multimodal models face?Introducing the Locked Image Tuning (LiT) method by GoogleDoes CLIP perform better than the Locked Image Tuning method?Another Google advancement: Pix2Seq - the New Language Interface for Object DetectionWhat do Pix2Seq and LiT mean for the SEO world?What Challenges Do Multimodal Models Face?The mix of pictures and text descriptions pulled all at once from the Internet has shown to be a powerful resource for artificial intelligence training. We already witnessed the rise of multimodal search and the rise of some prominent models like OpenAI CLIP and DALL-E. These trained, self-monitoring AI models have one big advantage: they learn a much more robust representation of visual categories since they don't have to rely on human-defined classifications. In plain English, that means that these models are able to perform image analysis tasks without additional AI training.However, multimodal models are facing some challenges: they are trained on image data that is using ImageNet as a benchmark and show poor performance for some specific and expert topics. This is also reflected in Google Image Search. Similar biases can be found when using CLIP in conjunction with a Diffusion model and on Google Image Search). That is why we study and use these models because this helps us do SEO in a multimodal-first world (that Google is pivoting with MUM).Introducing The Locked Image Tuning (Lit) Method By GoogleGoogle\u2019s computer scientists managed to create a new method for image analysis that combines the best of the two worlds: a multimodal model with powerful image analysis capabilities without the need to retrain for new tasks, yet achieve the precision of specialized models. The difference here is that Google\u2019s LiT trains only the text encoder. This is different from their previous multimodal approach where an image encoder learns image representations while the text encoder learns the representation of the corresponding text.Google is changing the game with LiT. They are dealing with a pre-trained model that uses three billion images that serve as the image encoder. The way this works is that the parameters of the model are frozen in the process of multimodal training. This approach ensures that the image encoder and its learned representations are not modified. The AI team used a private dataset covering four billion images with associated text that Google collected in previous years.Does Clip Perform Better Than The Locked Image Tuning Method?The industry benchmark for computer vision is usually ImageNet. The model trained with this new LiT method achieves 84.5% accuracy on ImageNet while at the same time it achieves 81.1% accuracy in ObjectNet benchmark without additional training.It is worth knowing that the best value that is achieved with ImageNet is around 91%, while CLIP achieved around 76%. At the same time, CLIP achieved 72.3 percent accuracy in the ObjectNet benchmark.In any case, it is worth observing that in any case, CLIP has been a truly turning point in this area. To sum it up, the power of CLIP and LiT is the same and lies in the ability to assess the similarity between an image and a piece of text.Another Google Advancement: Pix2seq - The New Language Interface For Object DetectionObject detection is useful for content moderation and image understanding. We wrote about our object detection experiments in our previous post about metaverse SEO. The need to understand different scenes while avoiding object duplication adds to the complexity of localizing only relevant object instances.&nbsp;Another challenge that the current approaches based on Faster R-CNN and DETR face is to reduce the ability of the model to generalize for other tasks. The need for redesign is clear, so the Google team proposed a new approach to ICLR 2022 , the Tenth International Conference on Learning Representations, called Pix2Seq.Pix2Seq takes pixel inputs for object detection. This new model achieves fantastic results on the popular large-scale COCO dataset. The idea is that for a given image if the neural network knows where the objects are located, one can simply teach how to read them out. The neural network is basically learning how to describe objects, so the model can learn useful object representations just based on pixel observations.In simple terms, this means that if we provide an image to the Pix2Seq model, it will give a sequence of object descriptions as an output where each object will be described through the coordinates of the bounding box\u2019s corners and a class label just like on the picture below.Source: Google blogWhat Do Pix2seq And Lit Mean For The SEO World?Object detection in images will definitely provide an extra layer of ranking signals that cannot be easily obtained or re-engineered back which will make things harder for SEOs that are already juggling with more than 200 ranking factors. At the same time, this can be also used as a shady technique for object stuffing in the images or metaverse-alike environments and this will pose a challenge for Google to recognize quality visual environments at scale.It is worth noting that current SEO software does not have the ability to analyze images and videos due to the complexity of the analysis that needs to be performed as well as the great amount of computing power that needs to be present in the first place.Looking on the positive side, the images (and videos) can finally \u201ctalk\u201d much like text already does: these new models and methods can be integrated into Big G\u2019s products like Google photo and image search, YouTube, and self-driving cars. The implications of these advancements in SEO are pretty big and so is the importance of having semantically rich data to train these models. Today we can quickly train (like we do for the multimodal search) CLIP to help us detect features from the image of a product and this is something that we, SEOs should not underestimate.&nbsp;To sum it up, the future is already here - organic results will not look like they look today: quality images, well-defined objects, and themed images are definitely likely to become central.[et_pb_section global_module=\"21359\"][/et_pb_section][wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

We use Google, Bing, Yandex, Baidu, DuckDuckGo, etc. as the main gateway to find information on the Web. We use Facebook or LinkedIn to search for people, associations, and events. We rely on Amazon or eBay for product information and comparisons, while when it comes to music we like to play stuff on YouTube or Spotify. We are decreasingly reliant on apps\u2019 features to find connections, dispatches, notes, timetable entries, etc. We've grown habituated to anticipating a search box nearly near the top of the screen. We also increased our expectations to get fast responses back while we search for things.This is how we and machines developed the use to connect information needs with information concepts and precisely how the fields of information retrieval and information emerged. Search queries are expressions of our information needs while the ranked lists of information objects are the answers provided back to the searcher.In the past, while search engines were in the early development phase, it was easy to play with keywords and links and use shady techniques to easily rank on search engines. Now, with the development of advanced technologies and algorithms like Multitask Unified Model (MUM) and Locked Image Tuning (LiT) we need to embrace more intelligent solutions and carefully crafted content to answer user queries in the best possible way and provide a satisfactory user experience.When dealing with natural language queries, we need to distinguish between named entities and concepts.Named entities are real-world objects and they can include:persons like Martin Splitt, John Mueller, Sundar Pichai;locations like Mountain View, Silicon Valey;organizations like Google, Pinterest;products like Google Assistant, and Google Cloud;events like Search UnConference, Knowledge Graph Conference, etc.Concepts are the opposite of named entities and they represent abstract objects. Some examples include:mathematical and philosophical concepts like distance, axiom, quantity;physical concepts or natural phenomena like gravity, force, and wind;psychological concepts like emotion, thought, and identity;Social concepts like authority, human rights, and peace.Named Entity Linking (NEL) And SEO - Smart Search Performance OptimizationIn many information extraction applications, entity linking (EL) has emerged as a crucial task in understanding named entities through their linked descriptions obtained from a knowledge base like YAGO, Wikidata, DBPedia, and similar. This process is better to know as semantic mapping or semantic linking in the computer science world:The first step of the entity linking process is entity extraction where we need to obtain the list of named entities in the text. A named entity compared to a casual entity is an entity that is already defined in a knowledge base or an NLP model;The second step is candidate entity ranking where after analyzing the user query we obtain several entity candidates in a ranked order. E.g. depending on the context, the entity [apple] can refer to the fruit or Steve Jobs\u2019s company;Entity interpretation is the final step where we decide on the best candidate for a given query input from the user and use this candidate to retrieve more information from a knowledge base back.Entity linking can boost your SEO performance by improving:Your mobile results: entities help improve mobile capabilities and mobile-first indexing which became dominant in search and it\u2019s growing every year.Natural language and image understanding for rich snippets: things like photos, customer ratings, and product reviews belong in this group.Translation optimization: synonyms, homonyms, context clues and query facets, and entity disambiguation help in translation improvements.Increased traffic and conversions: entity linking and entity disambiguation help search algorithms understand your content better and distribute it to more targeted users so that you\u2019ll have more visits back and increased chances to convert them into customers.How Applied Entity Linking Can Help Online Businesses In Marketing Content Operations?In the realm of marketing content operations, applied entity linking offers a myriad of advantages:1. Enhanced Content Relevance: By seamlessly connecting entities in your marketing content to pertinent information in a knowledge base, you ensure content accuracy and currency. This, in turn, delivers valuable and pertinent information to your audience, fostering heightened engagement and trust.2. Personalization and Targeting: Entity linking empowers you to grasp the context of your content more comprehensively. Armed with this knowledge, you can segment your audience with finesse, thereby delivering tailored content to distinct customer groups, augmenting the likelihood of conversions and customer satisfaction.3. SEO Optimization: Search engines prioritize semantically rich and contextually relevant content. By employing entity linking to link relevant entities to their corresponding knowledge base entries, you can optimize content for search engines, bolstering search engine rankings, and amplifying organic traffic to your website.4. Enhanced Content Recommendations: The act of linking entities in your content grants you valuable insights into the relationships between various topics and concepts. This knowledge is instrumental in providing users with more accurate and relevant content recommendations, thereby heightening engagement and prolonging their stay on your website.5. Streamlined Content Curation: For online businesses grappling with copious amounts of content, entity linking comes to the rescue, streamlining content curation processes. Understanding the entities mentioned in different pieces of content enables more efficient organization and categorization, simplifying the user's quest to find what they seek.6. Real-time Updates: With each update to your knowledge base, entity linking ensures that your marketing content automatically reflects the latest information. This serves to maintain content accuracy and reduces the time spent on manual content updates.7. Competitive Analysis: Entity linking can be harnessed for competitive analysis as well. By scrutinizing the entity mentions in your competitors' content, you gain invaluable insights into their strategies, focus areas, and market positioning.8. Sentiment Analysis and Brand Monitoring: Understanding the entities mentioned in the content, customer reviews, or social media posts facilitate sentiment analysis and brand monitoring. This insight enables you to gauge how customers perceive your brand or products, empowering you to take appropriate actions based on feedback.9. Improved customer service: Entity linking can also be used to improve customer service. For example, if a customer contacts your company with a question about a product, you can use entity linking to quickly find the relevant information in your knowledge base. This can help you provide more accurate and helpful answers to customer questions.10. Reduced costs: Entity linking can help you reduce costs in a number of ways. For example, it can help you save time by automating the process of linking entities to knowledge bases. It can also help you save money by reducing the need for manual research.Overall, entity linking is a potent tool capable of enhancing various marketing content operations. If you seek ways to boost your SEO, craft more informative and captivating content, personalize content for individual users, boost brand awareness, elevate customer service, or trim costs, then incorporating entity linking into your strategy should be a thoughtful consideration.Ready to turbocharge your SEO efforts and see your organic search performance soar?

        "text": "Visual Search: How To Optimize Your Content for Google Lens The checklist to optimize your content for Google Lens: Add Alt TagsInclude EXIF and IPTC Photo MetadataAdd Structured DataHave High Quality And High Resolution ImagesVisual content is one of the most direct ways to improve your organic presence.Image SEO and visual search optimization are the 2 aspects you need to keep in mind.If you want to learn more about SEO image optimization, you can check out our last web story.&nbsp;In this article, I will instead focus on how you can optimize visual search to appear in Google Lens to get more organic traffic and more visibility for your products.What Is Google Lens?Google Lens offers one of the earliest platforms for visual search - trained on millions of images. In addition to recognizing objects, it is also capable of translating and transmitting text found on images.As mobile devices have become more prevalent in everyday life, voice assistants have taken on an increasingly central role in search. The same is true for image search, as we all have a camera with us at all times. Google Lens goes one step further and allows users to search for a product they are interested in within seconds, using images and text at the same time.Imagine a person sees a friend wearing a dress and she likes it. Google MUM (Google Multitask Unified Model) is the giant transformer AI-based model trained with images and text that led to the introduction of multimodal search or Multisearch as Google itself has defined it.This means that users can combine information in different formats (photos, voice search, text, etc.) to find the product they are looking for. A real revolution for the search experience of users on Google, who until recently could only use text queries.&nbsp;In detail, Google Lens scans the image and compares it to its huge photo index and searches for that exact dress and several similar alternatives. And you can also search for the same dress but in a different color!&nbsp;This shows that it is essential for e-commerce to have products with SEO-optimized images that meet the requirements and have the necessary features to make them optimal for this search mode.&nbsp;How To Activate Google Lens?For Pixel users it is already active in the camera.Android users can access Google Lens via Google Assistant or use the standalone Google Lens app.For iPhone users, Google Lens can be activated via Google Photos or the Google app.How Does Google Lens Affect SEO?John Mueller answered answered this question in one of his Google SEO office-hours sessions:From an SEO point of view, there's nothing you can do manually, but if your images are indexed, we can find your images and highlight them when someone uses that type of search. So there's no direct impact on SEO, but if you do everything right, if your content can be found in search, if your content contains images, and if those images are relevant, then we can drive visitors to those images and your content in different ways.How To Optimize Your Images For Google LensGoogle Lens takes SEO for images to a new level thanks to Artificial Intelligence. And it's worth seeing what we can do to optimize SEO on this basis.Add Alt TagsInclude EXIF and IPTC Photo MetadataAdd Structured DataHave High Quality And High Resolution Images1. Add Alt TagsThe alt tags attached to a photo must contain the most important keywords, brand keywords and other information that is important in any type of SEO search. Do not forget to take care of the page titles and meta descriptions as well, which are equally important for search engine optimization.2. Include EXIF and IPTC Photo MetadataThe EXIF (Exchangeable Image File Format) is a specification that defines data about images, sounds, and tags used in digital still cameras. The date with your EXIF data should be optimized for Google Lens to make the most of the information. This will help your image and content rank better.&nbsp;The IPTC Photo Metadata Standard is the most widely accepted and used standard for describing photographs. It structures and defines metadata properties that allow users to add accurate and reliable data about images.In 2018, Google Images introduced some new features to its image search results. Next to a selected photo, the creator of the image, the credit line, and a copyright notice are immediately displayed. This works by reading the corresponding IPTC photo metadata fields embedded in the image file.On August 31, 2020, this feature was enhanced to also display a licensable badge above an image and a link to the licensing information.&nbsp;There are two ways you can add license information to your image:Structured data: structured data is an association between the image and the page on which it appears with the markup. You must add structured data for each use of an image, even if it is the same image.IPTC photo metadata: IPTC photo metadata is embedded in the image itself, and the image and metadata can be moved from page to page without being corrupted. You need to embed IPTC photo metadata only once per image.3. Add Structured DataAdd structured data markup that helps Google and search engines understand your content and images. For example, a recipe page would include in the structured data the name of the recipe, the author, the preparation time, and the publication date. It would also include a brief description of the text and images.Similarly, when the image represents a well-known entity (such as a person or a landmark), you can use the\u00a0schema:about\u00a0property to link the photo and the concept in Google's Knowledge Graph. To learn more about improving the markup of your images,\u00a0ImageSnippets\u00a0is a great starting point.ImageSnippets is an image-based, data-centric platform that links machine-readable descriptions to images using state-of-the-art Semantic Web and Linked Data technology and standards. You can see, using the tool, how images are translated into triples (subject > predicate > object) and immediately become machine-readable. Interestingly, the tool also uses AI to extract features, translating them into additional markup.4. Have High Quality And High Resolution ImagesMake sure you use SEO optimized images for your content. They should be of high quality, have a high resolution and be in the various formats required from Google best practices.&nbsp;Try our free AI-powered Image Upscaler to enlarge and enhance images from the website to improve structured data markup using a state-of-the-art deep learning model. Moreover, when dealing with Google Lens, it is essential to provide multiple angles of the same object and prepare the different versions for the same image (1:1, 4:3, and 16:9).An Example Of Content Optimized For Google LensIf you want to optimize your content for Google Lens, you can train Google to recognize them by providing semantic meanings behind media assets using structured data. You can also increase the quantity and quality of imagery to help Google learn about our products. Last but not least, remember to make always visible and accessible to Google the licensing metadata of the image. Adding licensing information allows web searchers to use the drop-down menu in Google Images for filtering images based on their license.Here below is one of the experiments we did, along with the team of Ippen Digital, where we succeeded in bringing one of their sites to the top for a visual query depicting the wall mural in front of their office.If you searched for the mural using Google Lens in October, you saw that it did not show up in the results, meaning it was not at the top of the rankings and none of the top results came from their properties. It was also interesting that Alamy was among the top results. Alamy is an excellent site that collects images and does a great job of promoting search engine optimization of their images.How could we help this publisher to optimize this content fo Google Lens?To achieve this, we worked on three aspects. Enrich the structured data behind these images. This allowed us to gain Google's confidence that, on the one hand, the images are rights-free and therefore can be used, and, on the other hand, that the images really represent this entity in this particular geographic area. So we added as much information as possible using structured data markup. Provide the images in different formats and from different perspectives. Because, as you can understand, if I need to train a model that is able to recognize an image, the model will benefit from high quality images, but also from multiple perspectives of the same object.Adding licensing metadata making the images free and accessible for everyone.  After a few months, we were able to outrank Alamy.In his talk at Knowledge Graph Conference 2022, Andrea Volpini talked about visual semantic SEO. In particular, he showed how you could use the knowledge graph of a website to train an AI-image generator that uses CLIP and a diffusion model and how a similar approach might be in use behind Google's recent multisearch functionality.   Most Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat is Visual Search?Visual search is an AI-assisted search via your camera instead of text.Imagine you are searching for a new pair of sneakers. You could go to Google and type in \"sneakers.\" You can refine the search if you know the brand. Or you could open Google Lens, snap or upload a picture of sneakers you like, and search with that. That's a visual search. Using machine learning and artificial intelligence, Google can pretty much \"read\" the content of your camera lens and search for it, showing you the results that are closest to what you're interested in. Appearing in this type of search is a sure way to increase your market share and organic traffic.Is Google Lens Free?Yes, it is. You can download it on both iOS and Android devices in their respective app stores.What is Pinterest Lens?Pinterest Lens is one of the most important platforms where mainly e-commerce companies are present. It allows searchers to quickly get inspired, but also to directly buy a product that interests them.Pinterest can accurately identify 2.5+ billion objects.80% of Pinterest users start their shopping journeys with visual searchThe platform has 454 million MAU (Monthly Active Users) globallyIt\u2019s well represented in most countries, especially in the West.[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

Starting with your product, going all the way through development, marketing, inventory management, store setup, and shipping, you\u2019re handling a lot of different elements! One of those elements, and often the most daunting to WooCommerce store owners, is managing your accounting! It\u2019s a necessary process to take care of but can also be incredibly time-consuming and challenging to understand if you\u2019re not already clued up on bookkeeping.At WordLift, we\u2019ve developed an integration that makes it easier for new customers to find what\u2019s in your store by creating software that automatically makes your products much more visible on search engines. We\u2019re committed to taking the worry out of WooCommerce SEO. But are there other integrations that make WooCommerce accounting easier in a similar way? We set out to find out the best accounting automation for your business, so you have more time to build what you love!How To Manage Your Accounting In WooCommerceAccurate accounting is fundamental. It allows you to manage your finances for growth and production properly, keeps any employees and expenses adequately and timeously paid, and helps you stay compliant with local tax regulations. Traditionally when you think of accounting, you tend to think of someone sitting over a colossal paper ledger, carefully poring over columns of facts and figures. Thankfully, most accounting is digitized in this day and age, making it much easier to keep records and much more viable to do your bookkeeping yourself as a business owner, rather than relying on an accounting professional. By far, the most commonly used bookkeeping software amongst eCommerce stores and brick and mortar businesses alike is the QuickBooks accounting suite, so for this article, we\u2019re going to refer to QuickBooks compatible tips, tricks, and integrations.The crucially important factors that you need to be tracking and recording in your store\u2019s accounting processes are:Your profit: How much cash you have in hand after your expenses are deducted from the money you\u2019ve taken. This will be all yours to spend and enjoy.Your incoming cash flow: How much cash comes into your business each month, down to the cent. This will help you grow by helping you figure out exactly where you should allocate funds.Your outgoing cash flow: How much cash you\u2019re paying out from the business every month for expenses, salaries, operating costs, rent, and taxes. If you don\u2019t keep track of these, you might not get them all paid in time.Your assets: The value of the materials your business owns. This includes your physical assets (like equipment) and your liquid assets (like your savings.)Your liabilities: These are any debts or loans your business owes and the interest charged on those.Your COGS \u2013 This means your \u201ccost of goods sold.\u201d Though technically part of your expenses, you should record this separately, too.Your WooCommerce store will generate some of these figures for you, but the more complex numbers you will need to generate yourself and add to your QuickBooks records. This takes lots of time and expertise, which you may not necessarily have. Thankfully, some integrations and extensions can make finding these figures and syncing them to your bookkeeping software much easier!How WooCommerce Accounting Extensions Help Business OwnersStarting an eCommerce business and being proficient at understanding accounting complexities are not the same thing. Developers internationally understand this, so they\u2019ve created a ton of extensions to help you automate your accounting process. These extensions will use computer programs to combine your customer\u2019s behaviours and your already-entered data through code to generate accurate figures that make sense and add that data to your accounting programs without you having to lift a finger!These extensions in the WooCommerce store can be totally free or come at a premium. The right combination of extensions will streamline your accounting process to immediately get accurate, easy-to-understand data.When you\u2019ve got accurate accounting data, you never need to worry about coming up short on payments or in your tax process. You\u2019ll have a perfect indication of how much money you can put back into developing your products and marketing to grow your reach and income further. Cleverly using extensions for your WooCommerce accounting can take all the anxiety out of your accounting process and let you focus on the real passion behind your business.Important Elements to Consider Before Integrating an ExtensionWhat a WooCommerce extension (or plugin, as they are commonly called) does is alter the code of your website to allow it to perform different functions. Think of this as going under the hood of a car and adding in new parts to help it do more things. Maybe a hydraulic lift to alter the suspension or some LED lights plugged into a battery to make it more exciting to look at.Though all of the extensions you add may work as bits of code on their own, sometimes, they get in the way of each other. Certain functionalities of these extensions may interfere with the \u201cspace\u201d that other extensions take up. If you add conflicting extensions, they may interfere with one another or the functionality of your store as a whole.In the WooCommerce store, most extensions will indicate if they have certain elements that cause conflict. If they don\u2019t, most development teams behind this software will have a support channel that you can contact to help you figure out any problems if they arise.3 WooCommerce Extensions to make Accounting EasierNow that we understand why accurate accounting in eCommerce is essential, how extensions could help you achieve that, and some important considerations you should take before adding any extensions, let\u2019s take a look at some of our favourite accounting extensions for WooCommerce:MyWorks QuickBooks Sync for WooCommerceThe MyWorks QuickBooks Sync for WooCommerce integration is an incredible time-saving tool. What the integration does, in short, is allow your WooCommerce store to communicate with and send information directly to your QuickBooks accounting software. All of the accounting data that your WooCommerce store generates is entered into your accounting software in real-time. You don\u2019t have to spend hours figuring out where figures go, and your books will always be up-to-date, without the possibility of human error.\u00a0Another exciting feature of the MyWorks suite is that it can perform a two-way sync up to every 5 minutes. This means that if you change fields in QuickBooks, they will auto-update in your WooCommerce store, and your inventory will always stay up to date. The MyWorks support team is available for contact 24/7 and incredibly hands-on, too!&nbsp;The basic MyWorks QuickBooks Sync for WooCommerce integration is totally free, and premium plans start at $19 per month. ReadyCloudOn its surface, ReadyCloud may appear to be primarily a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) extension. It\u2019s got an impressive, modular set of features to make your customer interactions more manageable, all located in one main menu. Where it really shines, however, is in its return and refund functionality and ability to create customer profiles.&nbsp;The plugin generates uncomplicated, comprehensive data that is much easier to record in your bookkeeping than a basic WooCommerce return would be by streamlining the returns process. The extension also automatically generates customer profiles and tracking numbers upon sales. This means that you can now create an individual customer profile for each customer in your books, which may provide an excellent opportunity for tracking consumer spending behaviours and improving your business model.&nbsp;You can try out ReadyCloud for free, and paid plans start at $24 per month.Oliver POSIf you\u2019re running both an online store and a brick-and-mortar retail store simultaneously, accounting for your inventory can be an absolute nightmare. If both portals are making sales, you may need to consolidate your books every night to stay on top of everything. Oliver POS is here to solve that problem.&nbsp;Oliver is a Point of Sale that can be integrated into both your eCommerce store and physical cashier stations. This plugin helps those two platforms stay in continuous communication, balancing the inventory between them and ensuring you never encounter the accounting nightmare of selling one item twice!

Having structural standards in the process of creating content is necessary because otherwise search engines like Google will not be able to grasp our content and algorithmically redistribute it afterward.As a content writer, you surely know how demanding the content analysis process is and how important it is to match the right intents that your readers have while guiding them in the user buyer journey. If you lose them in the first phase, you are done. Everything stops there. There is no second chance given because searchers rarely return to websites that do not solve their problems and provide the right information back.Experimentation As The Mother Of InnovationWe at WordLift go through the same problems in the content writing process as you do. We understand your frustrations, we simply encounter the same content and idea gaps and have trouble generating starting ideas for writing. That is why we often experiment with various external and internal tools that aid our writers in the content creation processes and what worked for us and our clients were entity-oriented content models where content knowledge-native structuring was the secret weapon in outperforming ours but also our clients\u2019 competitors.How Entities Make Your Content ModularEntities combined with a knowledge graph approach and JSON-LD representation is what aids content findability and portability. When the data is structured, it can be easily reproduced in another content format, populated in a different database or moved from one place to another in general. According to Aaron Bradley, a well-established knowledge graph strategist world-wide, it is how \u201cwe liberate the meaning of content from its visual representation\u201d. Content structure is the physical organization of content within systems. It is as simple as that.This Is How The Knowledge Graph-Native Content WorksWe are great fans of entities because they work better when they are connected. Search engines like them as well and we like to be the pioneers in adopting the general idea of building the web of interconnected meanings, just like Tim Berners Lee envisioned more than 20 years ago.We are great fans of sharing on how we do stuff because growing alone is not fun and because we believe that growing as a community brings everyone forward faster. In simple terms, our novel content writing approach is based on forming content knowledge-native foundations with an end goal to bring impact to our clients\u2019 SEO strategy:We gather keywords from Google Search Console, communication strategies or any keyword research process in general, just to form the basis for analysis;In the next step, our NLP and deep learning algorithm analyses the provided keywords and extracts TOP search queries that are associated with the queries that we provided as a basis in the first step;Once we are done with this, we analyze the extracted phrases and try to identify the most important entities based on manual observation but also entity confidence;Once the most important entities are identified, we build your knowledge graph out of them;Finally, our tool provides a JSON-LD output that can be used on your website.As explained before, this way we engineer our content for search and produce knowledge graph-native structured content but also how we engineer our content for reuse in an omnichannel context.You can build a Knowledge Graph from a SERP by using SEO Add-On for Google Sheets. To discover how you can do that, watch the video. https://youtu.be/2qoyQf9UMMkStart Using SEO Add-On for Google Sheets\u2122What Are The Metrics Used In The SERP Analysis Process?It is important to organize your entities around the most pressing user needs. That is why we use three different columns that aid content writers in the user-intent differentiation process:The first one is the confidence interval metric mentioned before which is very similar to the salience score that Google uses in their natural language processing API. In simple terms, the idea is to have a metric which will show how relevant the entity is to the general topic of the article through semantic similarity;The second column which can also be called the entity id column is where we show the disambiguated entity ID description from DBPedia. This way, you, as a content writer, can expand the description to understand the filtered entity even better and decide whether is one of the most important entities to establish your knowledge graph-native structured content for;&nbsp;The third column is the label column which is used to read the entity name as a quick filter in the decision-making process.&nbsp;What Should I Do When Working With Different CMS Systems?If you have a different content management system (CMS) other than Wordpress, do not worry - the JSON-LD code is available in the 5th step, so you can add it to your website through a plugin or Google Tag Manager. In any case, if you are using Wordpress with WordLift, we natively support Wordpress, so your entities will be imported right away.How To Deal With Multiple Similar Entities Or Many Entities In General?One way of solving this problem is using a clustering tool that will help you organize your entities into clusters to see which clusters dominate and which user intents are most prominent based on your keyword research process defined in step 1. We also recommend using a tool to generate long-tail keywords so that you can add a bit more variety to your keyword research process and avoid dealing with duplicate entities.What If I Don\u2019t Have Keyword Data To Deal With?This is what we excel at. If you are operating in a niche which is very specific and starts growing now, so you don\u2019t have much data as a result, you can just provide some starting ideas that describe your niche specifically and we will show you the most relevant entities for your niche based on SERP analysis.How is The SEO Add-on Different Compared To The WordLift Plugin?The SEO Add-ons for Google Sheets\u2122 analyses the SERP by using natural language processing and deep learning techniques in the process of extracting the top entities which are the most relevant to your starting search queries. On the other side, the WordLift plugin does the disambiguation process in the background and performs entity linking between the entities and their respective definitions provided by DBpedia.Excited to try this out?

        "text": "Mastering Entity Analytics: How to Measure Your SEO Entity Performance Table of contentsKeyword analytics, is it up-to-date anymore?Entity analytics - a different approachHow entity analytics and SEO entity performance workWhat if our system has many entity pages?Keyword Analytics, Is It Up-To-Date Anymore?Modern search engines and retrieval systems have shifted from keyword-based search to entity-based search. Therefore, as a result many information needs today involve searching for entities and understanding the relationships between them in order to obtain the right answers for searchers\u2019 needs. In simple terms, this means that instead of relying only on term-based searching and term-oriented ranking, we and search engines will exploit the structure of the knowledge graph. That is how entity analytics is born.In this article, we will focus on understanding how entity analytics is beneficial for developing modern SEO strategies and how it is different compared to previous keyword-based approaches that cannot be used anymore to establish a competitive SEO analysis and SEO entity performance in the modern world.The casual process of performing keyword research and analysis is to gather keyword information from multiple sources like Google Search Console, Ahrefs, communication strategies or sales data and then obtain the keyword ranking information or keyword volume data points. Then, you would use this information to filter out preliminary queries that fit user needs, calculate their potential for topical authority and embed them into your final content plans.To measure topical authority for a topic (eg \"e-commerce\"), we could measure how much (estimated) traffic a site gets from its underlying keywords. Example: if a site gets around 15% of available traffic for a topic and it is the highest share, then this site must be the most authoritative for that topic. Kevin Indig wrote an awesome article covering measuring topical authoritativeness based on defined keywords for a certain niche.Entity Analytics - A Different ApproachHowever, with entities in mind, the process is a bit different. We can take two individual approaches for SEO entity performance and entity analytics.The first one is focused on working with entities in the following way:You can get the top search queries your website or webpage is ranking for through keyword extraction techniques (try KeyBERT);In the next step, you can extract the most recurring entities from the pages behind these search queries by using Google NLP API or your own pretrained model for entity extraction (we use ours that is trained on DBPedia data);In the third step, you cluster these selected entities by using: graph embeddings, a well known topic in the computer science world;SBERT using the entity description from DBpedia;wembedder or BigGraph.Use the previously obtained information to analyze the topic you are interested in.To bring more clarity to this approach, we need to explain what graph embeddings, SBERT and wembedders mean. In simple terms, here is what they do:Graph embedding is the process of transforming nodes, edges and their features into a vector space while preserving all these properties in a graph-like structure and information.SBERT or BERT for sentence similarity is a so-called twin network that processes two sentences in a similar way simultaneously. It is often used in tasks where the model performs content clustering and classification.Wembedders are embeddings trained on Wikidata, usually used to perform nearest neighbor search.The second approach that you can use to apply entity analytics to your SEO strategy is using the SEO Add-on for Google Sheets\u2122 by WordLift that we are also using for our clients\u2019 work and strategy planning. The plugin does the following: Analyses your content in detail and performs entity resolution. \u201cEntity resolution is the process that resolves entities and detects relationships. The pipelines perform entity resolution as they process incoming identity records in three phases: recognize, resolve, and relate.\u201d;Once the entities are detected, they are connected to their respective knowledge-base definitions to be properly disambiguated;A knowledge graph is built.[et_pb_section global_module=\"22149\"][/et_pb_section]How Entity Analytics And SEO Entity Performance WorkThis is completely different to keyword analysis, because a separate page for every entity is created accordingly. So imagine that you have an e-commerce web page or you are a publisher like The Next Web and you want to know which pages or news articles are the most popular but on an entity level. Creating those separate entities will allow you to inspect analytics for every separate entity. So instead of analyzing page performance rich of unstructured data like text, you will be able to do analysis on a micro level, inspecting every entity individually.&nbsp;Imagine what this could mean for you if you are an e-commerce platform and have multiple cars featured there. We are sure that you would like to know what your audience characteristics are for Audi or Tesla models for example. Our entity-based system establishes exactly that: micro-level analytics focused on entities through entity building. Every page reflects a separate entity, so every data point obtained from Adobe Analytics or Google Analytics will point you to the data points for a single entity instead of analyzing keywords for non-disambiguated data (text web page).What If Our System Has Many Entity Pages?When dealing with multiple entity pages, you can perform entity clustering to obtain only the most interesting and dominant entities and filter out the rest. In fact, this is a recommended approach because over time, the entity corpus is going to grow more and more and some data cleaning and crawl budget optimization will be needed.Entity analytics is a powerful technique when used in the right way and with the right tools. It is just a matter of time when it will get adopted by the wider masses but if you like to remain competitive in your niche, you will definitely need to try it out.[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "Meet Elie Raad, our  Machine Learning Specialist! WordLift is proud to have a team member of his caliber on board: let's meet Elie\ud83d\udc99Quick FactsName: Elie RaadAge: 38Position in WordLift: Machine Learning SpecialistLanguages spoken: Arabic, French, English, and just started learning the Italian languageLet\u2019s Get to Know ElieTell us more about yourself\u2026Seeking new experiences and greeting new challenges that come my way has always been a big part of who I am. If you were to ask me, the journey began with my decision to study computer science, something that has fascinated me since a young age. An engineering degree and Ph.D. later, here I'm making the best of my professional life. So, on a typical day, you can find me sipping a cup of cold coffee and blending my CS background with my avid interest in R&amp;D! Over the years, I've had many wonderful experiences professionally and met some amazing people from around the world. Many became good friends. The opportunity to collaborate with folks hailing from multiple horizons and a myriad of cultures has been nothing but amazing. I could go on a limb here and say a part of me is a nomad- The spirit of freedom and the essence of independence is something I deeply value. Probably why I lived in different cities, and moved across three continents. I mean, what better way to authentically experience the local traditions &amp; heritage! I'm based in France currently, yes bonjour! After all, it's not too far from Italy, the headquarters of WordLift.Tell us more about your professional interest\u2026I've been working in data science domains for many years and have developed an interest in the field of data and more specifically to synthetic data. I believe that through the rise of synthetic data, researchers and practitioners will unlock the true potential of artificial intelligence. In case this is something that piques your interest, I've written a blog on the past, present, and future of synthetic data. How does your interest in synthetic data relate to your role at WordLift today?AI-generated content is one form of synthetic data. Pre-trained language models have a wide range of application areas. One can use GPT-3 to produce AI-generated content, aka completions. When it comes to generating&nbsp; high-quality completions that match the tone of voice of a brand, fine-tuning GPT-3 is the way to go. It's a main part of my work at WordLift and this is how we proceed when generating completions for our clients. I recommend reading the in-depth blog on the topic of generating e-commerce product descriptions using GPT-3.How do you see WordLift's mission and what do you like about WordLift?Building great products, combining the latest technologies, and working for something that makes a difference is my way of enjoying the process I'm part of. In line with my previous experiences where I built employment solutions to help people find jobs and then fintech solutions to get deserving people the credit they deserve. Now, with WordLift, I build AI-powered solutions to help entrepreneurs grow their businesses and brands reach a larger audience. To do so, WordLift's products bring together the best of artificial intelligence, natural language processing, knowledge graphs and SEO. And this is changing the future of how to grow businesses and promote brands.3 things you love the most about being a Wordlifter\ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f- Being part of a very nice and world-class team led by a visionary SEO, Andrea Volpini.- Opportunity to work on interesting topics and the latest technologies. It's a vibrant work environment.- Ability to keep learning about different topics and technologies that, in some cases, go beyond the real work.Can you share an exciting innovative work that you're doing at WordLift?Recently, I started exploring the power of DALL.E 2, OpenAI's new AI system that can create realistic images from textual descriptions. Innovating and pushing things forward is part of WordLift's culture. We run a new experiment to combine GPT-3 and DALL.E 2 in a single workflow. In a nutshell, we generate multiple completions using GPT-3 to describe one specific product. To pick the best one, all the completions are sent to DALL.E 2 to generate images. The last part of the workflow is to leverage visual similarity in order to pick the prompt, which refers to a GPT-3 completion, that enables DALL-E 2 to generate the most similar image. Jina AI\u2019s CLIP-as-service is used to find the best visual match. In fact, the visual similarity is compared with the product's original image.&nbsp;It's a specific use case, yet in an early experimental phase, but it's one interesting way to go beyond the seductive path of good enough when generating completions. Let's take a moment to pause, imagine, and then appreciate the possibilities this can offer.&nbsp;To illustrate this in an entertaining way, here\u2019s a comic that I generated using GPT-3 and DALL.E 2. The script is generated by GPT-3 while the illustrations are generated by DALL.E 2.&nbsp;Here\u2019s a snapshot of the GPT-3 playground to generate an exchange between AI experts on the topic of synthetic data.And here\u2019s the prompt that I used to generate a first image sample of two AI experts having a discussion: \u201cA comic illustration between two AI experts having a conversation. The bubbles are empty.\u201d. DALL.E 2 generated a suggestion of six images. Afterwards, I triggered DALL.E 2 to generate multiple variations of one image from the suggestion set.At the end, I used Canva to put together the AI text with the images in the comic format as shown below.Something you want to share with us and our community...One lesson I learnt and that I'd like to share is that less is more. It's amazing the number of application domains where this principle holds true. Beyond its evident application for personal belongings, digital minimalism (use technology in an intentional way) and programming minimalism (keep the code clean and simple) are two other application domains. In real life, it's not&nbsp; always straightforward to identify what really matters. This requires an extra effort to reflect and reassess priorities. Without seeking such clarity it's difficult to learn and distill knowledge in the age of information overload. As a knowledge worker, habits, deep work, and systems are the other important parts of my digital life to stay productive and keep learning.Get in touch with ElieLink to my Twitter / Personal website[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "Building Topical Authority and Brand Awareness through Entity Analytics Table of ContentsBrand awareness: building memorable brand names and symbolsWhat is topical authority SEO anyway?Building a connected world of entitiesThe WordLift approachGo beyond scraping: the benefit of using NLP to find related entitiesIs this the best brand awareness and topical authority SEO solution on the market?Brand Awareness: Building Memorable Brand Names And SymbolsBuilding your brand is not easy. Especially when you are just starting out. It is hard to pick the right name or the right logo when you do not have any previous data that you can rely on. In the old times, the process was relatively simple but very questionable: you would go to meetings, you would talk to the management, they would tell you their ideas and then you would form your branding strategy based on wishes and personal opinions, rather than collecting potential customer data in a data-driven way.&nbsp;The problem with that approach is that now we have the tools and the science behind to perform brand analysis at scale and even better, to approach this problem in a more scientific way. Why, you might ask?We have several relevant dimensions in the process of selecting the right brand name and its depiction as a symbol. The buying process requires us to pick something that is easy to understand, that is easy to memorize but also relatable to the industry or the niche that you are operating in. Brand symbols are communication tools and unfortunately a little research was performed on how brand names and brand symbols should be selected in order to achieve certain communication objectives. We were lacking more structured methods on how to approach this at scale or how to make it personalized for our specific use case.Let's say that you are an individual or a startup company and that you struggle to position yourself in the market, both from a business and a brand perspective. Your branding strategy should communicate the value and the unique value proposition that you are offering while at the same time, it should be cross-validated with popular search engines like Google and well-known knowledge bases on the Internet.Let us take an example. You decided that it is time to pick a proper brand name. Should you pick just a company name, like Apple? Or should you pick a company name plus the name of the product, like ProtonMail does for example, in order to communicate your company name but also the offering? You do not know. People did not know how to do this in the past. Luckily, now the game changes.What Is Topical Authority SEO Anyway?The same holds true for building topical authority. What is topical authority, how can we define it? Kevin Indig had a fantastic piece of work on this topic where we can learn that there is little agreement in the SEO sphere when it comes to defining this concept. Is it writing comprehensive content for your users? Is it balancing the PageRank between your pages? Is it creating connected worlds of related entities and concepts in a hierarchical way? Or is it being a recognized authority as a writer in your sphere of influence?&nbsp;Building A Connected World Of EntitiesI will give an example. Let us think about the topic of Novak Djokovic. When you think of Novak, you may also think about the concept of [\u201ctennis player\u201d] but also [\u201cJelena Djokovic\u201d] (his wife) and [\u201cWimbledon\u201d]. You could also think about his opponents [\u201cRoger Federer\u201d] and [\u201cRafael Nadal\u201d] or their own respective countries of origin like [\u201cSerbia\u201d] for Novak, [Switzerland\u201c] and [\u201cSpain\u201d] for Roger and Rafa. What will be your first topic of interest? What do users mostly care about? Which topic will be the best one to start with?You do not know. Until now. Luckily, as I mentioned before, we now have the tools to approach this in a more scientific way.[et_pb_section global_module=\"20980\"][/et_pb_section]The WordLift ApproachWe at WordLift regularly invest in tools and processes that make our work and clients\u2019 work easier. Besides this, we always share our approach with the community because we believe that growing together is a lot better approach than growing alone.We invest in tools that can help us scale our work but that are also very user-friendly and data-driven at the same time. We desperately needed a way to automate entity analytics at scale and we definitely needed an established process which can help us position our clients\u2019 brand strategy in the right way.Therefore, here is our solution: when not having enough data or established Google search console in the first place, we choose starting keywords. Having in mind that today we are talking about brand awareness and topical authority SEO, we chose these keywords as seed keywords and added two more keywords that are related to them (SEO marketing and brand analysis). Then we go to extensions, choose WordLift and then analyze SERP.Go Beyond Scraping: The Benefit Of Using NLP To Find Related EntitiesThe way this works and the competitive advantage of this extension is that there is an established natural language processing process behind it: we take the seed keywords, we scrape search engine result pages in the next step and through natural language processing process we compute the most relevant entity keywords that are related to the initial seed keywords. Once the processing part is ready, we can see all related concepts in the connected concepts tab like in the following picture:The confidence column shows how close that entity is to the queries provided in the first step. In the label column, we can obtain the entity name while from the same column we can obtain the disambiguated entity description for a given entity. We already elaborated about the process of entity linking in some of our previous blog posts but in short terms, this process enables us to find the explanation for every given entity that exists in DBPedia (we developed our own NLP model that is specifically trained on DBPedia).The benefit of this approach is that you will use NLP and knowledge-base techniques to discover the most important entities for your seed keywords. This goes way beyond a typical scraping where we only process SERPs and SERP features like People Also Ask (PAA) questions like most did in the past.Now, for this particular case we can see that the entity [\u201cThe Web\u201d] (referring to the World Wide Web) is definitely an interesting topic to write about. You would not know that this is a case when approaching this task as a human - you might want to proceed with on-page SEO as a first topic of interest. In this case, you would miss the Web topic, even though it is very important in the computer science world and covers how WWW started. Auch.Is This The Best Brand Awareness And Topical Authority SEO Solution On The Market?We can also play around with the confidence scores and use them to build your own information tree in order to establish your topical authority for the given keywords. The possibilities are endless, it is up to you how creative you want to be in the entity analysis process.We invest ourselves 100% in everything that we do and we like to be the visionaries in the SEO industry ever since WorldLift was founded several years ago. In any case, it is important to note that you should use your own expertise and collected data in order to benefit from this tool in the best possible way.Therefore\u2026.Go out. Speak with your potential customers. Talk with your marketing and sales team, they will point you in the right direction to understand customer needs and pain-points. You can be the master of quantitative data but it is also important to exploit qualitative data to make the most of both worlds. Only then can we be sure that machines and humans co-exist together and make this world a better place. Start using data-driven approaches combined with human power in order to solve the most pressing issues in the SEO world.&nbsp;The time is now.

        "text": "SEO And Conversational AI: A Real-World Use-Case Table of contents:What is conversational AI?Components of conversational AIBenefits of Conversational AI in SEOSEO and Conversational AI: a real-world use-caseHow to train conversational AIWhat Is Conversational AI?Conversational AI is the set of technologies, such as virtual assistants or chatbots, that can \"talk\" to humans (e.g., answer questions).Conversational AI tools use machine learning, automatic responses, and natural language processing. Their goal is to recognize and replicate speech and communication and create an experience of human interaction.AI technology can accelerate and simplify relationships with consumers by answering their questions and relaying their requests. It can be used on websites, online stores, and social media channels, and is often used in customer service.Components Of Conversational AIConversational AI systems have 4 elements that contribute to their development and operation.Machine LearningMachine learning consists of algorithms, functions, and data sets that systematically improve over time. Artificial Intelligence recognizes patterns with increasing input and can respond to queries with greater accuracy.Natural Language ProcessingConversational AI uses NLP to analyze speech through machine learning. Named entity extraction (NER) is widely used to detect intents (what the user has in mind when interacting with a chatbot).DataThe success of conversational AI depends on training data from similar conversations and contextual information about each user. Semantic rich data, in particular, can make a real difference when training an AI system as it provides contextual information.Conversation designCompanies need to develop the content that AI will share during a conversation. Using the best data from the AI application, developers can select responses that fit the AI's parameters. Human authors or natural language generation techniques can then fill in the gaps.Benefits Of Conversational AI in SEOHere are some key benefits of conversational AI.Create a personalized user experienceThe use of conversational AI makes it possible to provide users with a personalized experience that meets their needs. Whether it's making an inquiry, completing a purchase, or providing customer service, you can ensure users get the answers they need in real time without having to engage your team.&nbsp;Users who find the answers they are looking for are less likely to leave your site. This way, the time spent on the website increases and the overall performance of it benefits from the positive impact of using Conversational AI.We have developed a chatbot that is active in our documentation, and we show you the average time spent year-over-year on the most popular pages.&nbsp;Avg. Time spent year-over-year on the most popular pages.This data is for the last 7 days, but it already shows the immense positive impact conversational AI has on our website.Collect valuable dataConversational AI, like an internal search engine, allows you to understand user personas. The resulting data can be used to drive your business forward and give you an edge over your competitors.Get more conversions and new up-sell opportunitiesProviding appropriate and timely information and updates to customers through conversational AI increases conversion rates. Virtual assistants help customers navigate and find the right product or service for their needs.Conversational AI can also provide consistent and compelling up-sell opportunities that take into account consumer preferences, time, and other data to make the best possible offer.SEO and Conversational AI: a real-world use-caseAs we know, structured data allows the content of a website to be indexed more easily by Google and other search engines. The content is understandable for the machine. It has all the information it needs to understand what we are talking about and can use it to answer search queries. As a result, the results in the SERPs are more consistent, and users get more complete and relevant answers to their needs. In this way, our website gets more organic traffic and provides a better user experience that increases conversion rates.&nbsp;A chatbot works like a search engine. So what I do for Google will improve my chatbot (and my internal search). The same content we prepare for Google can also be used to train an artificial intelligence for conversations like a chatbot. And that's exactly what we did to develop the chatbot for our documentation.If you want to learn how to create a Knowledge Graph-based chatbot, I recommend our article.We trained our chatbot using Jina AI DocsQA's q-a service and we extended its knowledge by adding to the indexing flow also FAQs (question and answer pairs) from our knowledge graph. Structured data content (such as FAQPage markup) is available using WordLift GraphQL end-point.Not only that, we have included the link to our blog where the user can find the answer and read the full content. In this way, traffic is directed from the documentation to the blog, increasing the number of visits and making the user experience more relevant.Similarly, we are indexing (or trying to index) the FAQ content we have on the blog, and we plan to extend the same conversational AI to other parts of our site.Developing this type of chatbot using structured data and Knowledge Graph, we expect to achieve:&nbsp;increase time spent on the page on docsincrease number of interactions with the chatbot (not yet available)more visits from the doc to the blog.We will soon share our reporting!How To Train Conversational AIThere is more that can be done with a knowledge graph in the context of chatbots. Here is our latest research paper Question Answering Over Knowledge Graphs: A Case Study in Tourism on how to use the data in a knowledge graph to automatically generate questions and answers, which in turn are used to train the chatbot. To evaluate the proposed approach, the SalzburgerLand Knowledge Graph is used, which is real and describes tourism entities in the Salzburg region in Austria. The research results show that the proposed approach improves the end-to-end user experience in terms of interactive question answering and performance.&nbsp;[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "Entity Search: The Past And The Future [An Overview] Table of contentsHistory overview of entity searchQuintillion bytes of data - is data quantity enough to understand us?The (future) savior: knowledge-first approachWhat the future holds for entity search?History Overview Of Entity SearchThe topic of schema markup is not new. We pioneered these concepts in the SEO industry even before they became popular buzzwords and known tactics that actually bring value to websites\u2019 SEO performance. We have been using structured data in the past 20 years to describe data and make it more comprehensible across different datasets and systems, so that both humans and machines can process it properly and actually make something useful out of it.Along the way, we made sure that our readers understood the use of entities and entity disambiguation, since both of these concepts form the basis of our core products and we are definitely fond of the idea to be the visionaries in the industry and lead in the era of entity oriented search. We cared about entity identifiers, entity relationships and entity attributes and it seems that as the time passes, all of these ideas, slowly over time, will become more and more adopted among SEOs until they become mainstream.&nbsp;From a scientific point of view, the core problem when dealing with entities in the past 10 years was solving for entity ranking for various tasks, especially in the process of entity linking. You would have a search query that is entity rich, you would employ a retrieval method to obtain entities in the process and then perform entity ranking to form the final search results page no matter whether we speak about a platform based search like an e-commerce shop or news website or a big software like Google\u2019s.In the last decade, search engine optimization managed to progress to semantic search, linked data and question answering over linked data. This eventually led to ontology engineering, taxonomy optimization and knowledge engineering even though there are not many online resources to prove that this is the case. We know from practice that those companies who seriously get SEO, absolutely invest in these approaches (actually, investing more than just 6 figures on a monthly level).Quintillion Bytes Of Data - Is Data Quantity Enough To Understand Us?Roughly 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is created every day. When people speak about it, some of them believe that the sheer volume of available data means we have all the resources to provide an answer to a question without delay. If you can\u2019t, they declare, the solution is to get more data.&nbsp;The problem with more data, however, is that it does not necessarily mean that the search engines responsible for providing those answers can process them. If the data is not provided in a structured way, it results in a lot of computational effort and cost to understand the context behind certain user queries. What looks like a relatively simple process is actually a solution that is far from trivial and requires some scaffolding and structuring to function optimally.The (Future) Savior: Knowledge-First ApproachKnowledge-first approach is more user-centric, relationship-oriented and requires more context when solving problems. We ask ourselves the following questions:Who\u2019s the end user who will consume the data?How is this data related to our systems and our people who work on them?Why do we need to take care of data consumption and data activation in order to be more productive?It is clear that in order to form a successful SEO strategy, your teams need to be versatile both in the data world but have the business acumen as well. That is why we predict that the next 10 years will include more collaboration between the data and the business teams and these hybrid positions are already in place in some of the bigger companies worldwide.And not just that. Knowledge graph analysis and knowledge graph scraping will become the foundation on creating intelligent long-tail SEO strategies through finding similar entities in the knowledge graphs themselves.We are proud that we managed to publish more than 12.5 million entities to the Linked Open Data Cloud through our products and are still continuing with our work, making the Internet better, one day at a time.[et_pb_section global_module=\"20980\"][/et_pb_section]What The Future Holds For Entity Search?The core focus in the past 10 years in entity search was focusing on retrieval models and more specifically on entity representations. Richer query annotations were taken as they are and a bit for granted. In the future, we definitely need to focus more on understanding user interactions, information needs, data sources and novel retrieval methods. Those who want to advance, will exploit the power of knowledge bases who enable the modern features of entity search. That is why the key questions here are:How to enable humans to maintain and expand knowledge bases at scale?How to improve the entity annotation process so that we can increase the process of entity retrieval?How to provide direct entity summaries to properly answer demanding user needs?This leads us towards a zero-query search world, where search engines will need to be proactive in order to solve for reactive search.And not just that: we definitely expect to see mashing up personal, enterprise and public data, enabling multiple views of the same data and gaining the ability to actually edit the data that we see. Entity search in future will be dependent on the idea of being able to \u201cquery\u201d the Internet through SPARQL queries which will use HTML document URLs as Data Source Names. Cross-platform data manipulation will also become a thing. In addition, content hubs and content hub SEO of the future that will rely on graph embeddings and clustering when creating content plans. Everything will simply go in the direction of exploiting the power of intelligent knowledge graphs and knowledge graph embeddings.However, bear in mind that anticipating user needs in a constantly evolving world is not easy. Luckily, we at WordLift have the technology and the scientific know-how to tackle these challenges in a more structured way. The key for you to solve these ever-changing user needs is to power your content creation and maintenance process with a knowledge graph strategy where all your entities can be described and explained to search engines. We are here for what comes next and ready to work together to solve pressing user-needs.Are you?[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "Proving SEO Structured Data Value: How To Convince Top Management Table of contents: Building SEO reputation and trust through observation, listening and documentationStructured data value through data analytics and data dashboardsProve structured data value through case studies and A/B testing experimentsProving SEO structured data value to management can be hard if you know nothing about it. Especially if you are new to SEO and do not have a lot of experience, an established process, or a framework to follow along the way. We have all been there and we have seen it happen to our clients, their internal SEO teams or independent SEO consultants. It gets even more difficult when you do not have a data-driven strategy for how to approach it in a more structured way. That's why we want to help you overcome this problem. So, let's go!Building SEO Reputation And Trust Through Observation, Listening And DocumentationFirst of all, it is OK to know that you are not the only one dealing with these issues. All SEOs struggle with proving value to top management for different reasons. However, the most important reason is that you may have just joined the company and have not yet earned a reputation among your colleagues. You need to find a way to prove your expertise and show your \"I know what I am doing\" attitude.One way to do this is to observe. Familiarize yourself with your company's values, business model, stakeholders and \"influencers.\" Understand the structure of your team and others. Listen to what people have to say, especially when it comes to marketing, user experience, sales departments and SEO teams in particular.They are the ones who interact with users or potential customers on a daily basis - they know their pain points, desires, and user personas best. If you take a genuine interest in what problems other teams and customers are facing, you can accumulate a lot of knowledge, which will speed up the integration process.Document what you have learned. There's nothing like bringing structure to your learning process. Open your Confluence page or Google/Microsoft document and start jotting down your observations. Small to medium sized companies often struggle to establish a proper documentation process. So if you can document your findings in a way that everyone can understand in plain English, you'll be ahead of the game.Structured Data Value Through Data Analytics And Data DashboardsAt first you have no idea how Google Data Studio or Tableau works? We know from practice that many SEO professionals share your feelings! We do not know how many people can really claim to be masters of using Google Data Studio (just so you know, we struggle with it from time to time too) or mastering creating smart data visualizations and proving SEO structured data value. Working with this type of software can be like dealing with a two-year-old child that you do not really know what they are trying to tell you, but they always want to be right somehow, so you have a sort of passive-aggressive relationship: You insist on \"telling\" the tool what kind of report you want, and unfortunately you'll find that you do not get what you planned on the first try. Playing with the elements, styling and some nuances of UI in general can sometimes be complicated\u2026The secret is to not give up, be persistent and patient. These tools are designed to help you make sense of your data from multiple data sources. If you can not do it on your own, try contacting the engineers on your internal SEO team and asking for help there. You'll find that with the right approach (e.g., \"Hi, I'll buy you a beer if you can help me with this\"), they'll actually be happy to help you out and give you something back. Just try it out for yourself - as long as you respect the engineers' time and tasks, you'll be fine.We at WordLift, tend to plan for projects and tools that help us automate our work. That is why we developed the Google Data Studio Connector, which in a few steps makes it possible to collect data from different resources, blend them together, and as a result obtain reports that clearly show the value of entities. This tool has a double value: to understand how to improve the strategy you are following. So it has a double competitive advantage.Stay genuinely interested and engaged. That will be your competitive advantage over the others. Management wants data-driven, sound strategies. So whenever you have the ability to quantify your efforts, you can be sure you are on the right track. Once you get it right, you'll feel a sense of exhilaration when everything is going well and you'll want to refine and improve even more. Do not give up\ud83d\udcaaProve Structured Data Value Through Case Studies And A/B Testing ExperimentsThe quickest way to prove SEO structured data value to top management is to find similar cases where other companies have used structured data (schema markup) to improve their SEO performance. Top management wants to see a comparison with the competition. So if you can prove that others are already using this as a competitive advantage, it will be easier to sell this to your top management.If you want to learn more about the top 5 underutilized schema markups for e-commerce and classifieds websites, I recommend you read my article.In any case, the fastest way to prove the value is to choose a concrete schema type, select your variant and control groups of URLs, run a test on a small sample of correctly selected pages, and analyze the result. This approach is even better than collecting case studies, because you directly conduct experiments and measure the results on your SEO platform. In other words, we know from practice that it's better to collect first-hand data so you can say, \"Hey, this works on our pages,\" so we should implement it site-wide.Free Demos And TrialsSometimes it's difficult to just observe or run A/B tests if the development team has not allocated you resources. In this case, it's always a good approach to play with some product demos and product testing phases. You can use them to run initial tests, try out new features, and use that knowledge to strategize how to sell something internally. Most test phases are free. So take advantage of being able to play with a particular product before you actually buy it.[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "Top 5 Underutilized Schema Markups for E-commerce and Classifieds Websites Table of contents:The status of schema markups - is it exploited enough?Top 5 underutilized schema markupsConclusionThe Status Of Schema Markups - Is It Exploited Enough?SEO evolved a lot in the past two decades and if we take a time machine to go back to see how things were in the beginning, you will see that in the past you would not need to do much: grab a link here and there, stuff your website content with keywords (not entities like today) and your job was done. Nowadays, when the web is increasing, when the algorithms advance and when the crawl and index budgets are becoming really limited, especially for large websites featuring thousands or millions of URLs, you need to be lucrative and structural about how you approach SEO at scale and what you do with your web-shop / classifieds website.Structured data (or better known as schema markup in the SEO world) is one thing that you can scale through programmatic SEO. We know from practice that it is something that can be pretty complicated to do, especially when trying to do it alone and site-wide. We are very aware of these processes and it is our strength to remove that pain away, so that your devs can focus on their work to accomplish other tasks.[et_pb_section global_module=\"22540\"][/et_pb_section]The process usually goes through the following phases: you define the schema, you populate the fields by taking some info from different APIs or a database, perform filtering, construct the schema and then inject it on the web-pages through JavaScript afterward.Even though it seems relatively simple and very straightforward, it seems that a lot of websites are not utilizing the power of schema markup to its full extent. Given the fact that schema markup is beneficial for winning rich snippets on SERPs and help being featured in Google Shopping, it is critical to assess the situation in a more structured way.Therefore, we performed an analysis of the top 100+ e-commerce and classifieds websites in the world (English-search) based on Google searches by using an automated process and some Chrome plugins. Our analysis showed that when the website managers use schema markup on their website, they usually rely on BreadcrumbList, Website/Webpage, Product, SiteNavigationElement, LocalBusiness and ImageObject schemas (or no schema at all). However, the results were far from satisfactory. Why? There is still a lot of potential when it comes to implementing schema markups and we are here to help you overcome that. Let\u2019s go!Top 5 Underutilized Schema MarkupsLet's look at what are the most underutilized schema markups for e-commerce and classifieds websites.Organization SchemaIt seems straightforward and almost common sense but a lot of the platforms we analyzed did not make a proper use of the organizational schema or no use at all. The Organization schema is nice when you want to describe that you provide different offerings from different organizations.Let\u2019s say that you are an e-commerce store which gives offerings from multiple small businesses. One way to help search engines understand the differences in the offerings and the companies offering them is to implement different organization schemas based on different company details. You can accompany this nicely with the property OfferCatalog - another underutilized schema type like the Organization one itself when implementing it on the different business offering pages on your website.PriceSpecification SchemaPriceSpecification is nice to apply when you can obtain information about the cost of the product and it is definitely helpful when you want to reach specific, targeted audiences that know what they want. For example, let\u2019s say that a user (a potential customer) is searching for [\u201ccheap Nike trainers\u201d] on Google. Also, let\u2019s assume that you are a Nike trainers provider and sell Nike shoes for 59 dollars. Google is capable of matching certain prices with price ranges for different products or in other words it is able to figure out whether the product, depending on its category, is cheap or not. Now, this could be very tough to determine if you are not using the PriceSpecification schema.Why? Because if you provide this information as a text, it might get difficult to disambiguate whether the number represents a price, a dimension, or quantity for the given product. It simply requires processing power and time that search engines don\u2019t want to go through, therefore, serving it very clearly to them means winning new audiences.Car SchemaRemember, you will always need to find the best schema that describes your business case and aligns perfectly with your business plan. I have seen countless examples when platforms have used the Product schema when in fact they could use a more specific schema type to describe their business offering.One such example is using the Car schema markup.Let\u2019s say that you are a classifieds business and that you offer cars for renting or buying. It will be far more correct to put the Car schema to your product listing pages or the Car schema together with the Product schema combined by using @type: Product, Car. The idea is to build up your business entities in the best possible, explainable way and as long as you are more specific to the search engines, you can expect to reach and target your perfect audience. Be specific.Shipping SchemaAre you shipping products to your customers? Then let users and search engines know. How would they know if you do not do that in a structured way? Different sites use different expressions and symbols to help users understand their shipping details. Here are some examples:Amazon uses the location symbol and writes \u201cDeliver to [country]\u201d;Anibis.ch uses Google location maps and write the street number to help the user calculate the shipping details;Ebay uses a mix of the previous two, by showing the location symbol and the street number;Eat.ch uses the clock symbol and write the minutes for delivery based on location;Wayfair uses natural language without any symbols:Free shippingGet it between Tue, Aug 9 - Thu, Aug 11Ship To: [location]This is an example from one case study that we performed for a US retail website where we tested the use of the ShippingDetails Markup. The uptake is SEO benefits after the implementation shows that this schema type implementation brings huge value back. We identified a statistically significant impact of +36.24% on the clicks after applying this change. It\u2019s definitely worth it to put it for testing in your SEO product backlog.FAQ SchemaIdeal for category pages - this is where you show multiple results for a given category, based on the faceted navigation that the user interacted with in the first phase. If you have a webpage with mixed intents where you show product listing info but also frequently asked questions by the user, it is smart to exploit the power of the FAQ results schema type. Definitely one of the most underutilized schema markups out there. If you want to learn more about FAQ Schema Markup and its potential, I recommend you take a look at our web story.ConclusionTo sum up, the way information is shown across different websites and for different offerings varies and it is hard to grasp, especially when it is written in natural language. The way to solve for this and standardize the process is to use the schema markup that most closely \u201cexplains\u201d your offering to searchers.Otherwise, search engines like Google will need to train their systems to recognize certain elements on your page either through regex implementation or computer vision scripts to detect and obtain this relevant information from your pages. This is not a trivial task to do, especially when done at scale.[et_pb_section global_module=\"20980\"][/et_pb_section][wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

Or you are barely starting in the SEO industry?&nbsp;If you are looking for a way to sharpen your schema markup knowledge or searching for interesting schema markup questions for interviews, then this is the post for you. We see you and we are here to help you cover the essentials but also a bit more advanced topics when it comes to handling schema markup questions starting from beginner to advanced.&nbsp;Here we go! :)&nbsp;What is schema markup?Schema markup is a way to organize your unstructured data like text, video, and picture in a more comprehensible form for search engines. Given as it is, unstructured data is hard to decipher, extract meaning and find all the necessary relations between the words. That is why we use schema markup in a form of JSON-LD (JSON Linked Data form) to explain what this unstructured data contains.&nbsp;Example: let\u2019s say that you are featuring numbers that represent prices for your products on your website. Without schema markup implemented there, it will be complicated to figure out whether this represents the working hours of your online business, the street number of your business place, or something else. Robots (search engines) are like small kids: you need to explain everything to them in a very straightforward way otherwise, they will mess everything up. You surely do not want to deal with that.What does JSON-LD mean in SEO and why should I use it instead of microdata?This is one of the most important schema markup questions out there.&nbsp;JSON-LD is the preferred file format for search engines like Google and it represents a way to encode your linked data in a JSON file format. It is relatively easy for both humans and machines to organize this data in a JSON-LD format and that is why it was picked to be the modern default file format by the search engines.Example:&lt;script type=\"application/ld+json\"&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"@type\": \"Person\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"address\": {&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"@type\": \"PostalAddress\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"addressLocality\": \"Colorado Springs\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"addressRegion\": \"CO\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"postalCode\": \"80840\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"streetAddress\": \"100 Main Street\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;},&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"colleague\": [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"http://www.example.com/JohnColleague.html\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"http://www.example.com/JameColleague.html\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;],&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"email\": \"info@example.com\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"image\": \"janedoe.jpg\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"jobTitle\": \"Research Assistant\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"name\": \"Jane Doe\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"alumniOf\": \"Dartmouth\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"birthPlace\": \"Philadelphia, PA\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"birthDate\": \"1979-10-12\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"height\": \"72 inches\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"gender\": \"female\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"memberOf\": \"Republican Party\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"nationality\": \"Italian\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"telephone\": \"(123) 456-6789\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"url\": \"http://www.example.com\",&nbsp; &nbsp; \"sameAs\" : [ \"https://www.facebook.com/\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"https://www.linkedin.com/\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"http://twitter.com/\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"http://instagram.com/\",&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\"https://plus.google.com/\"]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;/script&gt;In this schema markup, we are describing a person that is a research assistant with the name Jane Doe and added some personal information about her, such as her birth date, social media accounts, and other relevant information about her. Easy, right? :)&nbsp;Always try to provide an example. You will make sure that the other side who asks, no matter whether it is a trainee or an interviewer who wants to test you, can confirm that you know your drill really well and understand these concepts in depth.Who is Tim Berners Lee and why is he important for the SEO world?Tim Berners Lee is a British computer scientist and entrepreneur who invented the World Wide Web or better known as WWW at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in 1989.&nbsp;The web itself is an information system that enables accessing documents and other web resources too. Tim wanted to invent a way to easily transport information data over the Internet for scientific purposes but eventually, this project took another direction and expanded over the world. That is why today Tim Berners Lee is known as the father of the WWW.His work is of great importance for the modern SEO world and generally, the vision of having interconnected worlds of data through linked data principles is the direction in which SEO is evolving. We spent more than 2 decades to get there and most probably we will need to have another 2 to make it to the final stage, but it is more than obvious that this will happen for sure.[Pro tip]: giving the answer to the schema markup question like the one above shows true depth and expertise - it is not just about knowing certain important people from the web world but also being visionary and predicting the general direction in which SEO is going.What is the intersection between the WWW and schema markup?The official web platform for learning about schema markup and its implementations, known as Schema.org was invented as a result of the WWW because people wanted to find a way to easily exchange documents over the internet. There is an established consortium called the W3C consortium which cares about producing standards for the world wide web. Its general mission is to help utilize the whole potential of the web. One of the priorities is making the data more exchangeable and accessible and this is where schema markup comes into play.What you should consider when implementing schema markup?In general, it is very important to understand your own industry and the business model in the first place. Schema markup is definitely the way to help search engines like Google understand your content better but you must be aware of the fact that this can affect the speed of the webpage where you are implementing it. This adds to the overall weight of the webpage and if not planned carefully, things can easily go bananas.&nbsp;It is also important to understand the effort that your developers need to take in order to implement schema markup on your web pages - you definitely need to know your thing, otherwise, it will be expected that you would not get any resources on this topic from your tech team.How can schema markup help your business?This schema markup question is absolutely essential: the main reason for using schema markup is to give information to search robots. In simple words, this is like stating clearly - \u201cHey, I am this person, I own this online business, we offer these products here and we exist here or there\u201d. It is easy and straightforward because you do not need to analyze anything - the bot just comes to your website, searches for structured data markup, gets that info, and uses it to feed different machine learning algorithms in the ranking phase.&nbsp;The other reason to do so is to gain more visibility through rich snippets shown on search engine result pages (SERPs) - Google, Bing, and other popular search engines on the Internet use this information to show the data in a more visually rich manner, like ratings, map packs and other visually rich features on SERPs.How can you measure the performance of your schema markup on your website?You can achieve this by using the Google search console. You can go to the Performance tab on the left and analyze concrete pages by entering the URL manually or through a regex to see how they perform (Page or Query). Another way to inspect the result of your schema markup implementation is to use the search visibility feature. Finally, you can measure the value of structured data by performing A/B tests and visualize the search performance in Google Data Studio. WordLift has its own data connector that you can use for this purpose to inform your SEO strategy in a more intelligent way.Do you want to ensure that your schema markup aligns with the best practices of Google and Bing and validates against their guidelines? Do you want to know if the syntax is correct and validates against the schema.org vocabulary? Run a structured data audit by using our free app.Can you name 5 different schema markup implementations that are often used online?It is hard to determine the most popular schema markup implementations on the Web because every business case is specific and requires proper analysis to utilize the power of schema markup. Therefore, there are many different schema markup types that can be used online, depending on the data that we want to explain.&nbsp;For example, you can use the \u201cLocalBusiness\u201d schema type to markup your company online or \u201cPerson\u201d to explain different person characteristics on the net.\u201d Product\u201d is definitely more used on eCommerce and classifieds platforms, while \u201cOrganization\u201d and \u201cBreadcrumbs\u201d are also useful when \u201cexplaining\u201d category pages and individual product detail pages. It always depends on the business case that the webmaster is facing in the first place.How can you validate the structured data you have produced?It is always nice to validate your JSON-LD before publishing online otherwise, you will encounter a lot of reported mistakes that need to be fixed in tools like Google search console. There are some Python libraries that help with schema validation but you can also use Google tools like the Schema Markup Testing Tool or JSON-LD playground website. Make sure that you are writing a proper JSON-LD markup implementation before publishing it online.What\u2019s the future of schema markup (structured data)?The world is slowly shifting towards more visual search appearances online and metaverse ideas are slowly taking over the Internet. Having in mind how complex it is to process these visual appearances online, it can be expected that schema markup will rise even more in the future because we will always need to find a way to explain our product, offerings, and business information online. Schema markup is here to stay.[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

Suggest to website visitors that valide alternatives are available. Message:Conclusions And Future WorkCreditsAdditional QuestionsBelieve it or not, this dreaded error page can be the most visited page on your website and represents an important point of contact for many website visitors.I have always loved error pages because they can be very creative and, at their best, express the brand's personality and core values: They bring a light sense of humor to otherwise frustrated users (see 404 from Salzburgerland.com, which I have always admired).What is a 404 Page?A 404 page is a landing page that informs your users that the requested page is not available or, in some cases, does not exist. The error message is displayed when a link is broken, the user has entered the URL incorrectly, or there is a configuration problem on the web server.Handling 404 Errors in SEOOne thing must be said: Regardless of how much effort you put into editing your website, 404 errors are inevitable. However, there is a lot you can do to both increase brand awareness and make things easier for Google. A broken link is generally a bad experience for the user and bad for a search engine's crawler. As the number of errors increases, a search engine will begin to lower the overall ranking of your website.There are several reasons for a broken link:A page may have been deleted, such as a product page for a product that no longer exists, or some of the content may have been incorporated into another page.The page has been moved to a new address and no redirection has been configured.There is an incorrect url somewhere on the web (or on the website).The web server does not handle the trailing slashes correctly. Google crawls and evaluates individual URLs. This means that the URLs must be unique. A URL with and without a trailing slash at the end are effectively two URLs.In general, it's a good practice to redirect some of those 404 pages to relevant URLs on the site (I wrote about how to do that on scale here some time ago). It's never helpful to redirect all traffic to the homepage, quite the opposite, this makes Google think your homepage is a soft 404. This is dramatic, yet very common, and we should always avoid it.An error is a signal, for us (there is something that needs to be fixed) and for a crawler (this page does not exist anymore).Why We Need A Custom 404 PageIt is important to send a clear message to the user: There is nothing here, the link you clicked on is broken. At the same time it is an opportunity to:Keep the user engaged on the website.Show them your brand identity.Reduce the bounce rate.Keep them in the funnel (this applies to e-commerce, but also to blog content designed for conversion).Get users to convert.Design Patterns For A Good 404 PageThere's always something new to learn from great websites, and when it comes to 404 pages, HubSpot has compiled a great list of examples. Among the most recurring patterns are the following:Links to the newest or most popular pagesA search barCreativity and humorous text to let visitors know they are in the wrong placeContact informationBrandingMain navigation (header and footer)Optionally you can find:ONE CTALinks to social mediaA video content, doodle or something entertainingA link to report the errorHow To Manage 404 Pages For E-Commerce WebsitesE-commerce websites follow a different logic: every time a catalog is updated, something may change in the overall website architecture. When a product is out of stock (either temporarily or permanently), you generally have three options to choose from:Remove the page (PDP) so that the user lands on a 404 page. We can mitigate the impact by replacing any links we have to web pages at the top of the funnel, such as product reviews or blog posts.Leave the PDP untouched and focus the CTA on driving sales of similar products. I like this option because it keeps the SEO value intact, but of course it negatively impacts the user experience if it gets out of hand and the recommendations are not good enough. Here are two important recommendations you should follow:Use structured data to highlight the right product availability. There are several options to choose from, and even if Google shows items that are on backorder as out of stock, this is important information to have.Remember to show product availability on PLP pages and internal search results as well. It is important to inform the user before they come to the PDP.Add a 301 redirect to the PDP of another page with a similar product or related category. This is a good option, but also risky, as the new product will become outdated and you'll create a chain of redirects that will break the crawl budget.You need to make your choice based on several factors (is the unavailability temporary or is it permanent? Do you already have links leading to the site? Is the page well visited and so on) which solution works best.Build A Multimodal Search Engine For Product Recommendations \ud83d\uded2Let us now focus on the first option and improve a customized 404 page using the product knowledge graph on our e-commerce demo site.The workflow is simple and provides a foundation for understanding how things work behind the scenes. Here is the Google Colab we will use for the data preparation phase. Once the data is ready, we will install and run Jina NOW locally and deploy the search engine to the Jina Cloud to keep things super simple.Here is what we will do:Gather product data using a GraphQL queryCollect product title, description and imagePush a DocArray - this is a key library in Jina designed for nested, unstructured, multimodal data, including text, image, audio, video, etc.Run Jina NOW SearchCreate a text-to-image searchIndex the DocArray created in the previous stepsRun the queries:Extract top n matches given a text (semantic similarity)Re-rank results (additional business logic)Architecture OverviewIn this tutorial, we will use a demo e-commerce website with fictional products called Fashion Therapy. We created the underlying product catalog by slicing and enriching the WDC Schema.org Table Corpus, which is available for public download provided by the University of Mannheim.The original dataset included 18,521 rows. After data cleaning and enrichment with categories (accessories, shoes, bags and clothing) and colors using our NLP stack, we obtained more than 4,500 products.The site runs on WooCommerce and uses WordLift. The product data is the least you can find on an e-commerce website.The same data used for structured data is also used to develop the semantic search engine. As we can see in the diagram below, structured data is provided with WordLift via GraphQL: a developer-friendly open source data query language.If you run your own infrastructure, you may need to extract all structured data from your CMS or crawl the website (here is how to run web scraping for SEO tasks).On the Jina side, we create a DocArray and push it to the Jina cloud. Launch Jina NOW from our local computer and index the DocArray we transferred to the cloud earlier.In this implementation we will create a text-to-image search. NOW will index images using CLIP and we will run queries using text strings.1. Gather product data using a GraphQL queryWe will run the following query on the KG, as you can see I can access properties using the schema vocabulary:To do this, we use a function called wl_graphql that returns a data frame with the attributes we need. We currently use only one image per product and rename the column with the URLs of the images uri. With this, we instruct Jina NOW that these are the URLs of the images to be indexed.2. Collect product title, description and imageNext, we create a single column called full_text that contains both title and description, and apply two filters:One to select only recognized image formats (png, jpg, etc.).One to randomly select 300 products.We might, in some cases, prefer the option of creating a text-to-text search engine instead of an image search, as we will do in this tutorial.Choosing What We Want To IndexIn the real world, we would apply business logic here, since it is not necessary to index the entire catalog. A recommender system, like the one we are building, needs to be intelligent enough to show only the best products (i.e., the most popular products or the products with the most hits) or what we want to sell (i.e., a combination of popular and on-sale products). For simplicity, we will use .sample(300) to select the products to index.Make Sure That Files Are AccessibleJina NOW will analyze the data frame (small_df), download and index all images in the uri column. Before we do that, let us check if all images are available.We have two options:Downloading the files locally and creating the DocArray from the local files.Checking the validity of each URL when creating a DocArray from the data frame.We will choose the second option as it is the simplest. So I added a simple function to check the https status of the images before creating the DocArray (this is optional, but might be helpful in some cases).3. Create the DocArrayWe can now create the DocArray with a simple line of code.And now we can push it to the cloud with another command. We are going to generate a random name for it and use da.push().We can now access the DocArray using its name (404_attvltyz in this case).4. Run Jina NOWHere comes neural search into action. We are going to use the Jina NOW library. This open-source library allows us to quickly set up text to image search.&nbsp;now.jina.aiWe have partnered with Jina AI to integrate vector-based search into the WordLift platform, and we are particularly focused on e-commerce and conversational user interfaces. Running Jina NOW is pretty straightforward, but I would recommend following the instructions right here as things are constantly changing.Select the text-to-image search, set the quality to medium, and specify a custom dataset by passing the name of the DocArray we created with Colab. Once the data stream is created, you can access the APIs directly or use the Streamlit playground to test things out (it's ready for you to test here).Testing the APIYou can interactively test the search end-point using the swagger from \ud83d\udc49https://nowrun.jina.ai/api/v1/text-to-image/docs#/Text-To-Image/search_search_post.&nbsp;See below the settings to run the query on the image-to-search Jina NOW built for our e-commerce demo site.\u00a0From there in WordPress you can edit 404.php and make the required changes like we did.Let\u2019s try a few examples on our demo site:https://product-finder.wordlift.io/the hat I likehttps://product-finder.wordlift.io/super duper leather dresshttps://product-finder.wordlift.io/pink sunglassesAs you can see, we use everything we get in the URL after the domain name as a text query to show the most similar results we have (links were not added to the results).Create a 404 template using GPT-3 and DALL\u00b7E 2In addition to the recommended product listing, I also ventured into creating the layout for the page using DALL\u00b7E 2 and the message copywriting using GPT-3.DALL\u00b7E 2 for the visualsWe can start with something simple like this (prompt follows):The layout of a creative 404 error page for a men and women fashion website.When composing the prompt, we must remember a few essential rules, like adding men and women, to prevent the otherwise strong association between \u201cfashion\u201d and \u201cwoman\u201d (an unwanted bias).The layout for a 404 error page on a men and women fashion e-commerce.Small variations can help. We can also get more creative and create one single photographic element that we will use on the page. Let\u2019s try it.Two models, a boy and a girl, depicted from the back in a 70's discotheque. Neon style, 4k, hyper realistic photography.Two models, a boy and a girl, in a 70's discotheque. Neon style, 4k, hyper realistic photography. They look confused.You can see how this could be further developed to create something unique for our website.GPT-3 for the copywritingLet\u2019s quickly set up the prompt for the error message using GPT-3. Here follows a first zero-shot implementation.Write a creative copy for the 404 error page aimed at fashion shoppers: Message: Ouch!Here is the final output (in green).Let\u2019s make a small change to the prompt that would work well with our recommendations.Write a creative copy for the 404 error page of a fashion e-commerce website. Suggest to website visitors that valide alternatives are available. Message:This makes sense and I hope you got an idea of how all of this could work.If you want learn more about Prompt engineering in SEO, I suggest to see our web story. Conclusions And Future WorkAs usual, we need to go into live testing and apply the right business logic to select the assets to be indexed. We want to make sure that there is a proper feedback loop to increase the quality of the results and therefore the sales on the website.Jina NOW is progressing nicely, and while we have used text-to-text for automatic internal linking in e-commerce, we have experimented with image-to-text here. As far as implementation goes, things are similar. In reality, relevance always boils down to two crucial aspects:The quality of the data we send into the flow. The more we specialize the data set based on SEO best practices and business logic, the better it gets;The model used. We rely primarily on a fine-tuned model to create automated product descriptions. Also, in search and recommendations, it is crucial to improve the quality of the results by changing the parameters according to our dataset.Happy SEO-automation!CreditsI finally want to thank the Jina AI team and particularly Joschka Braun, Mohammad Kalim Akram and Florian H\u00f6nicke leading the NOW team. Also special thanks to our Claudio Salatino for working on the PHP side of the project.&nbsp;Additional QuestionsWhat's the difference between 404 and 410?A 404 tells the search engine that the page is not available at that location, and it has probably never been there (in other words the server has no idea about that resource and sends the correct HTTP status code \u2014 a 404 Not Found). The 410 indicates that a page is no longer available, but it used to be there in the past. In general, if you want to prevent Google from re-crawling a URL, you should go for a 410. In an experiment conducted by the team at Reboot, 404 have been crawled 49.6% more frequently than 410.&nbsp;&nbsp;What is a soft 404?A soft 404 is when the search engine receives a 200 HTTP status code but it thinks the page actually should be considered a 404. It can happen when we automatically redirect traffic to the homepage or when we have a blank page on the website.Does Google index 404 pages?No, Google will not index 404 error pages, they are simply a signal that the resource is not present at that location. However we can customize the error to engage the web site visitor.[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

I graduated in Milan at the University of Milano-Bicocca in the Communication Sciences course and started my work as a consultant in the field of web listening and online reputation analysis and design of online and offline communication actions.I was a project manager in the field of online marketing. In this role, I managed numerous projects for small, medium and large companies in the fashion, tourism, pharmaceutical and wholesale industries. These projects included e-commerce as well as communication and branding activities.SEO and CRO /UX are activities on which I have given very important advice in my career, following the evolution of search methods, algorithms and ranking techniques both on Google and other search engines.3 things you love the most about being a Wordlifter\ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0f- Working with a multidisciplinary team with strong expertise in SEO, Data Science and AI solutions development.- The opportunity to work in depth in knowledge graph creation with the most innovative tools.- The work environment and strong approach to research and development.Can you share an exciting innovative work that you\u2019re doing at WordLift?I was very impressed with the methods used in WordLift to measure the performance of an SEO campaign, but also with the advanced tools used to categorize search intent. With the algorithms, I was able to quickly process and cross-reference so many variables and decide on the most predictive set for large data sets.&nbsp;This allowed me to quickly decide on meaningful clusters for each intent, create variants, and take steps to personalize the browsing and internal search experience.Can you share exciting innovative tools that you\u2019re using at WordLift?I found the SEO Add- on for Google Sheets extremely useful. It was designed to extract entities in the Knowledge Graph and synchronize them with Google Search Console data.&nbsp;I was able to quickly match large amounts of information with a very high quality of information architecture and correctly transfer and update it to JSON-LD while adhering to Schema.org standards.Actions were quickly implemented based on a selection of pages, and I could continue to quickly compare the data with Google Search Console data. This made the experience of SEO work very smooth and intuitive.In addition, with the SEO add-on, I can automate other operations or transfer them for later updates of content, entities and vocabulary on the website or e-commerce.What I like is that in WordLift you always have an eye on your own work and that of other SEOs. This leads to the development of new and innovative tools that aim to facilitate workflows. One example of this is Data Visualization, which lets you evaluate measures to implement structured data on the page via the Google Data Studio connector.When used in conjunction with the WordLift plugin, it allows for quick, accurate and impactful upgrades and intuitive evaluation of results.

        "text": "The Value of First Party Schema Markup Data: Here\u2019s Why You Need to Care Table of contents: The Problems With Second and Third Party DataWhat Is First, Second and Third Party DataDigital Marketing ChallengesHow Does Using First Party Schema Markup Data Software HelpConclusionThe Problems With Second and Third Party DataFor years, digital marketers have relied on data collected by partners or data brokers in the process of analyzing their potential audiences and crafting strategies to win customers online. However, the truth is that today, in the modern world when the competition is exponentially increasing on a daily level, it is more important than ever to demand better data. Better data is the path towards more intelligent and customized customer experiences online - there is nothing more powerful than utilizing what you have on your side in the first place.First party schema markup data is a way of using your data to provide more context to your business online. And while it is not easy to do it on your own and it might seem costly sometimes, you should never forget that second and third-party data are complex and do not give an insight of the whole customer purchasing journey online. Yes, that is right. Whoever claims something different, is lying to you. It is the first party data that matters or the first party data schema markup that has the hidden gem in the SEO world.What Is First, Second and Third Party DataTo go straight to the point, first party data is something that you directly collect from your customers, online searchers and own completely on your side. You have a full control on this data, especially when it comes to first party schema markup data. This includes customer surveys, analytics data, log file data, CRM systems, call centers, social media, website and your content too.Second party data and third party data are owned by somebody else and you need to pay to get access to it. In simple terms, it is not something that you can directly access and may not fit your business case fully.Digital Marketing ChallengesWe understand the challenges that digital marketing professionals are facing because we have been present in the digital marketing world in the past two decades and we have seen from practice that the power of this data is not fully utilized. There are many different reasons and complicated culture architectures and relationships that impact this. If we need to sum it up, then we would say that the first party schema markup data is largely untapped because of the following most prominent reasons:The management does not want to invest in marketing because they see it as a spending rather than an investment. Usually, this is happening as a consequence of having very little knowledge of the marketing world and having the prejudice that \u201cmarketing is easy to do\u201d and \u201cthe magic will work by itself\u201d.There are not enough allocated technical resources because devs do not want to deal with \u201cmarketing stuff\u201d since it is not formally part of their everyday work. You might learn that devs do not want to deal with it because they do not consider it to be \u201ctechnical enough\u201d - automation and digital transformation are still getting their way in the marketing world (yeah, even after corona, hmmm).Previous experiences in working with marketing agencies has proven to be ineffective due to lack of a strategy on how to report the findings in a more data-driven way. First party schema markup data definitely requires this, so be sure that you have the right professionals with you alongside.The vast amount of rich and reliable data like emails, contents and SMS is hidden in plain sight because there is a lack of technical understanding on how to combine this data together to form a data-informed strategy.SEOs do not understand the real reason behind the existence of schema markup and therefore are not utilizing it enough as they should. Linked data principles and publishing to LOD is still new to them, so there is a lack of established strategy on how to reuse knowledge graph data.The list goes on.How Does Using First Party Schema Markup Data Software HelpNow, while it is fine to use SEO software that helps with SEO analysis on a more basic level (full disclosure, we also use other SEO software to enable our work), things can change when you need to report to experienced managers or C-level executives. Why? Because they demand a clear understanding of the data collection process. Sometimes, they also want to know all the nitty-gritty details behind the SEO strategy behind. Why is this happening?SEO software is absolutely needed in order to find a way to report back to management but if you do not use first party data and especially first party schema markup data, you will risk your credibility as a true SEO professional. We all know that management wants everything to be simple and have reports showing only one line which either goes up or down, however, this cannot be useful if you are not using your first party data trend line. Keyword data is useful when planning your content strategies but what can be more useful than actually understanding&nbsp; your own content data in the first place?Second and third party data is misleading and unreliable. It can guide you in the wrong way, thinking that you perform well when you actually do not and this can be easily detected when the revenues simply do not match the SEO wins that you are claiming. We had a situation in the past when some of our partners thought that they were underperforming when doing analytics by using second and third party data tools, when in fact they were actually doing great when using Google Search Console data and our own knowledge graph data. Differences are easy to spot when you understand the nuances and the differences of both.ConclusionTo sum up, everything that is not first party data is questionable. How will you justify your strategy in front of top management then? You cannot - the reality of the SEO strategy behind simply does not match what is happening in practice. It is full of data gaps, little sampling and lack of unified metrics - it is hard to report on something when you do not understand the data collection process and metrics formation behind it.First party schema markup data increases relevance, authority and reliability. It is something that you own and can organize. What is even better, it is reusable because you can work with graph databases and knowledge graphs to power up your internal enterprise system while empowering your SEO at the same time.In business it is all about having a clear understanding of what you own and how you can \u201cplay it\u201d to its full potential. The same is in the SEO industry - use software that eases your work but make sure that you know how this software collects your data and how it distributes it further.We at WordLift are proud to work with Google Search Console data (first party data tool) and provide expertise using first party schema markup data too. We form and use structured forms of your own text, audio or visual data to enrich knowledge bases like DBpedia or intelligent assistants in the process of information analysis and distribution. We care to make sure that you work with the most clean and reliable data possible and that is our premise: doing clean and open business for everyone. What is even better, first party data cannot be lost overtime while you can lose second and third party data if you stop paying for it.&nbsp;[et_pb_section global_module=\"20980\"][/et_pb_section][wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "SEO Content Strategy for More Targeted Customer Traffic: Make Your Writers Feel Respected Table of contents: The Content Journey - Past and FutureValuing Content Writers - Is It Possible?Democratizing ContentLinked-Data Content As a Competitive AdvantageThe Content Journey - Past and FutureContent has evolved a lot in the past decade - we have UX writers, technical writers, content engineering and even content operations. Content has become \u201cthe way\u201d to win customers online because they are constantly searching for answers to their problems and opportunities to educate themselves before buying something.If we analyze the past decade, we would see that what seemed to be an SEO content strategy in the past, it simply does not fit the definition of today. In the past, when speaking about \u201ccontent strategy\u201d, you would define it as a process of hiring copywriters, giving prepared, non-data-driven topics to write about, increase their salaries from time to time and be satisfied with whatever was produced on their end. It was easy to post content online and game the web search systems to get visitors to your website and that was enough.Valuing Content Writers - Is It Possible?We need to adopt a new way of thinking about content. We need to talk about content operations and have deeper conversations around how the work that the content writers are doing is having an impact across the field. This is necessary if you want to make your writers feel respected: instead of constant content creation that does not demonstrate deep expertise and creating content for the sake of search engines, you need to shift your mindset and produce content that fills the gaps and helps you stay ahead of your competition.&nbsp;What we know from experience is that constant content creation can make your writers feel overwhelmed, disgruntled, disorganized and pressured to deliver something that does not satisfy anyone\u2019s criteria: the readers (end consumers), the business and the writers themselves just for the sake of writing something every week. Who does not want to get up in the morning and produce something that others find useful and has a purpose? Every true content professional likes to pour their heart into their work and drive business results back, by doing what they are best at.This is where advanced SEO content strategy comes into place. Ask yourself the following questions:How do you organize your content in order to pop more on search engines?How can you position your content to be reusable and easy to distribute to ensure semantic interoperability?How can you make your content fit different content management systems (CMSs)?How can you establish new content practices in order to stay ahead of your competition?How can your content be designed so that it can be consumed by AI for processing?How can you tailor your content by persona, vertical, industry and develop audiences based on these criteria?Finally, how can you make your content people feel valued and believe that their work has a real impact on the business?Advanced SEO content strategy is now shifting and what the modern content writer needs to be a skill-based polyglot: combining a bit of everything. It is like having a big tent covering multiple things - it includes not just a skill to create content but also understanding the information systems that keep the data in behind and the whole lifecycle starting from content creation and going up to content delivery.The question is: when having limited resources and little insights on the ongoing trends in the content industry, how can you deliver something useful and at scale, while optimizing for efficiency for your content writers?Democratizing ContentContent creation nowadays is more than just opening a GoogleDoc document and writing some stuff down. Today, every content designer should be able to communicate the effectiveness of the content that is produced by defining a set of key performance metrics and standards that need to be taken care of.However, if you are constantly changing your content team or on-boarding new writers in a short time span, it might become challenging to introduce intelligent content practices business-wide. New on-boardings mean training for a specific skill set that requires HR involvement and training budgets that your organization might not have planned for. There is ongoing frustration and confusion - how to approach this problem then?Linked-Data Content As a Competitive AdvantageWe worked with over a dozen customers and we got insights from their content and team structures and we can predict with confidence that you are facing the same problems as them.Long story short, you need to find a way to democratize the process of content creation and distribution. Every writer should be enabled to do his best possible work, writing user-centric content and not something for the sake of search engines.&nbsp;One way to make it easier for your content writers is to enable them to distribute their content further and go beyond traditional SEO. You need to help your writers understand their end consumers better and increase the clarity in their existing content pieces rather than forcing them to produce content more and more. The solution is to employ a user-centric approach and linked-data backbone which focuses on smart content delivery as easy as possible, ideally in just a few clicks during and after the content creating process.We at WordLift have helped content writers deliver more than 2000+ pieces of content in a more structured way by using our own custom tools, like some plugins and dashboards but also linking this content with the Linked Open Data Cloud. In simple terms, this means that we enabled our writers to focus on what they are the best at: writing genuine, original and useful content that answers their potential customers' needs and spending less time on optimizing for search engines.[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

Incorporate SEO from the Start\ud83e\udd13 Table of contents: The future of SearchConversational AI and SEO: concrete stepsA real use case: From Google search to WordLift\u2019s AI powered chatbotTakeawaysConversational AI has been part of the enterprise landscape since 2016, but it has entered the scene in pandemic times. It has supported customer service and provided content suggestions to help businesses and people through difficult times.In this scenario, it has become increasingly necessary for enterprises to invest in developing conversational AI to cope with changing user behavior. Conversational AI is therefore among the top 5 categories in AI software spending and its evolution from simple rule-based bots to intuitive chatbots that can accurately mimic human responses by providing assistance to customers and company employees.&nbsp;So the evolution of user behavior has also led to a change in how search engines work. Google search is increasingly becoming a dialog. The advancement of conversational search inevitably affects SEO. In this article, I'll show you how you can build a Conversational AI by using SEO to provide users with an optimal experience that increases the number of visits and the time users spend on your site.The Future Of SearchSearch could be reimagined as a two-way conversation with question answering systems synthesizing and answering users\u2019 questions much as a human expert.Metzler, Donald, et al. \"Rethinking search: making domain experts out of dilettantes.\" ACM SIGIR Forum. Vol. 55. No. 1. New York, NY, USA: ACM, 2021.Today, when you do a Google search, you get results appearing in different Google rankings and features: SERP, top stories, People Also Ask, Google Knowledge Panel, etc.Thanks to conversational AI, search will take the form of a dialog between the user and the search engine, which is not only able to answer a query, but also to anticipate the user's wishes.&nbsp;If you own a website or are an SEO, then you need to be able to fit into this workflow.In \"traditional\" search, SEO was required to:Rank at the top of Google\u2019s search results for target queries, e.g., \u201cGPT-3\u201d.Earn a knowledge panel in Google\u2019s Knowledge Graph for your business, people, products, etc.Rank relevant video content on the first page for target queries.Answer specific questions to be featured in the People also ask (PAA) section.With conversational AI, the plan of action changes, and to make this happen, it is necessary:Win the SERP competition for target keywords.Provide a great user experience on your website.Make it easy for users to find the right content (UI, navigation, search functionality, chatbot, ..).Optimize for user retention whenever the information is available on your website.For this to be possible and for you to get into conversational search, you can use your content. By storing your data in the Knowledge Graph, you can make your content accessible and reusable for developing a conversational channel such as a chatbot.Building a conversational AI channel on your website is crucial in taking advantage of the opportunities and benefits of interacting with your customers. This will allow you to leap ahead and gain a significant competitive advantage over your competitors.But let's go through the concrete steps that will help you build a successful conversational AI starting from SEO.Conversational AI and SEO: Concrete StepsIn this scenario, SEO plays a crucial role. How can you build a successful conversational AI ? To do so, you need to follow the steps below.Build your Knowledge Graph. In this way, you can leverage the power of entities and the relationships between them to provide Google with all the information it needs to understand your site content and to provide users with results relevant to their search queries.Earn a Knowledge Panel. Through it, Google provides quick and reliable information about people and brands. Getting a Knowledge Panel on Google depends on the data. The more accurate and consistent they are, the more accessible Google will put the information together and return a perfect Knowledge Panel.Use the VideoObject. Adding Schema Markup\u2019s VideoObject feature, you can use video as a magnet to attract traffic to your content by building irresistible, clickable snippets.Use FAQ Schema Markup. FAQPage structured data format can help you increase the footprint of your results on the SERP.Having a bot and having the KG + FAQ you can deliver a better user experience to the users on the website itself (and eliminate the requirement to go back to Google to search for another info).A Real Use Case: From Google Search To WordLift\u2019s AI-Powered ChatbotWordLift is replicating what Google is doing (at the scale of a single website).Leverages the same data published on the websiteCreates a chatbot on top of transformer-based modelsIn terms of information retrieval, a chatbot works like a search engine. So what I do for Google will improve my chatbot (and my internal search). The same content we prepare for Google can also be used to train an artificial intelligence for conversations like a chatbot. And that\u2019s exactly what we did to develop the chatbot for our documentation.We trained our chatbot using Jina AI DocsQA\u2019s q-a service and we extended its knowledge by adding to the indexing flow also FAQs (question and answer pairs) from our knowledge graph. Structured data content (such as FAQPage markup) is available using WordLift GraphQL end-point.In this example, you can see how to take ownership of the user journey with WordLift.Case 1: Google directly provides the answer to the question/search query. It\u2019s thetop page result.Case 2: Google returns the passage that talks about GPT-3 in the article about generation product descriptions.Case 3: Google displays the questions/answers that are added as FAQ schema markups to the article.Developing a chatbot like WordLift's that can replicate Google's responses has many benefits: Improve the user experience by providing answers to their questionsAvoid losing a user we worked hard for by keeping them on the site once we have an answer.From an analytical point of view, increase the number of users visiting the website and increase the time spent on the website (if this happens, it means that we serve users better).TakeawaysRethinking Search. Search can be reimagined as a conversation.Two visions. Know-it-all AI vs. relevant and accurate information.No additional effort. Same content that is created to support Google ranking and visibility can be used to train an AI to converse like a chatbot.Multibot orchestration. Stack of bots, master bot and bot grouping.Personalization. Era of hyper personalization for users and for businesses.Multimodality. Enable text, image, videos, etc. in a single query.To know more about how Conversational AI meets SEO, watch the video\ud83d\udc47https://youtu.be/m3l5RFKz5l0Elie Raad at the Bots Brasil Conference 2022[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

We anticipate that this may be useful to those who face the challenges of structuring content on a large scale. So we truly hope that our thought processes and tools logic can aid you in the content automation &amp; distribution process.The Importance Of Structured Data AutomationArtificial intelligence and structured data automation are paving their way to the content world and slowly dictating the future of content strategy. We have seen it everywhere: no matter whether we speak about an image, video, the metaverse or text in general, AI virtually touches every aspect of this content world: creation, maintenance, ideation or content management and content analytics - all these areas are impacted by AI at scale. It is more than clear - those who choose to ignore these trends are already left in the past. You as well.If you want to set the standard for content strategy, then it will be inevitable to include artificial intelligence and knowledge graphs in your regular work. They have the power to help you explore what is happening on a page level but also on a page type and category level, up to the gaps and opportunities that you can tackle to win new audiences online.What Dealing With Over 4000 Companies In The Last 5 Years Has Taught UsWe have spoken to over 4000+ businesses in the past years and one thing that all of them cared about is how they can improve their internal content processes, especially if you are in a constant content production process. You don\u2019t need to be a large publisher to apply automated principles to your work - as long as you create content regularly, this will apply to you too. Chiefs of content, content architects, digital practitioners and SEOs have asked us how they can organize their content in a way that is reusable, structured, easy to distribute and above all, easy to understand.&nbsp;The key question was not only how to do this at scale and in a data-driven way but also in a way that it is cost-effective given the value that AI can produce for the business. The answer: use structured data automation.Why Content Processes Are A Total MessThis might look irrelevant for you if you are just starting out in the content world, but things will become complicated if you plan to stay in the market in the long run. Blogs can easily get overstaffed with articles that do not drive user value and are:Hard to organize by categories.Tricky to be used for training new natural language processing models.Difficult to navigate around, especially if you are doing some basic tag management.Tough to understand and analyze, especially when doing cross-checking with your competitors.Almost impossible to establish proper content analytics due to inability to categorize at scale.Challenging to follow all different restrictions when it comes to schema production for separate page types &amp; edge-case scenarios.The list goes on.AI-powered content management is here to stay. Being AI-native and emergent, not just AI-driven, will be the superpower of those who are visionary and want to set the course of tomorrow by using the latest trends to approach their content processes in an intelligent way. That is what digital innovators and martech pioneers like you do.We are practically speaking about a whole world of redefined roles where the casual marketer no longer exists. We will see new specialties being developed: knowledge-native content writers, information architects, marketing technologists and data analysis automators will drive the content architecture of tomorrow. Given this fact, you might ask yourself: knowing this (and no matter my background), how can I aid my content writers of today so that they can become the content marketers of the future?Learning To Use Structured Data Automation In Order To Become The Marketer Of FutureContent practitioners can superpower their content strategies by including AI in their everyday work. One way to do so is to use machine learning algorithms for content categorization and smart tag management. Another way is to use prebuilt plugins which can help you organize your content on an entity level, so that you can see which entities drive more organic traffic and produce more revenue back.This does not come as a surprise. We have known about these \u201csuperpowers\u201d in the computer science and engineering world but it seems that now they managed to advance even more when cloud computing and improved linguistic analytics took the lead in the recent years. They have become guiding principles and also very interesting for content practitioners because they are easily accessible to every individual, not just for big content teams.&nbsp;The key thing that transformed industries is maybe not AI itself, but the fact that advanced technologies have become more accessible and democratized than ever. Accessibility has changed all - what looked like science fiction in the past is becoming the present and the future.You might think, \u201cWow, wait a minute\u201d and feel like everybody who\u2019s approaching you is giving you a typical sales pitch but just think about your established content practices for a moment:You have writers just for the sake of producing content;You have SEOs who optimize this content to be more search-friendly so that people can find you online;You have content managers who care about the whole CMS management and making sure that everything works properly;You pay data analysts to analyze the data you\u2019re producing, so that you can know what to invest in in future.It will be easier if you can help your team of 5+ people to speed up their work and without internal training, especially when on-boarding new people in the organization. Let's not even talk about all these meetings in between that are needed for your content and data-related people to consolidate between themselves in order to prioritize their work. We are talking about hours and hours of time that can be saved on a monthly level. Your internal search technology also depends on this. Why wait?To be more specific, here is how the exact process of structured data automation works:You need to perform an in-depth analysis of your SEO efforts;Structure your outcomes and define key performance metrics (KPIs) for your structured data automation process;Start automating your SEO efforts and see the results in just a few weeks;Scale your SEO by using AI, knowledge graphs and machine learning for content creation.Always Be Testing, Always Be ValidatingScaling is not easy when you are doing it alone, no matter your team or company size. In fact, we tend to underestimate scale in real life. We\u2019ve learned from practice that structured data small teams tend to think that a good template would do the magic: you have a product page, you have attributes for your products - why can\u2019t you just add the markup at the template level, right?&nbsp;The reality is that efficiently scaling the markup requires continuous testing and improvement. You might have the image for your product but you can also invest effort to produce multiple images for various resolutions. You might have the right price for your product but you might have forgotten that there are places where you cannot ship it. It is hard to obtain this information easily if you do not establish the basis for your knowledge graph to be created and maintained regularly. We have so many practical examples where improvement at scale is applied to thousands of products by using a knowledge graph that can blend data from different sources and some NLP in between.We\u2019re telling you this because we have tried-and-tested marketing strategies that drive growth and we have seen the people\u2019s excitement when they can do what they are best at, while using the power of AI and knowledge graphs to help them speed their content efforts. That\u2019s what we\u2019re most proud of at WordLift - enabling people to do their best work and not forcing them to have a deep dive into the latest technological trends because that is what we do best -&gt; remaining tech-savvy, visionary, focused, research-oriented and practical.&nbsp;&nbsp;https://twitter.com/ziodave/status/1543874289484677121Start with us today.

        "text": "WordLift CVE and the WordPress Plugin Directory Review TL;DRWordLift 3.37 was temporary removed from the WordPress plugin directory, between the 22nd of August until the 7th of September 2022, in response to a security report. The critical level was considered low, however we immediately released a patch version and we followed up with a full code review to tighten the plugin together with the support and feedback of WordPress volunteers. On the 7th of September WordLift was reopened with version 3.38.0.IntroductionThe WordLift Plugin for WordPress is our most developed and used client of the WordLift platform.&nbsp;The plugin development started more than 10 years ago as an experiment into bringing the power of the Semantic Web into WordPress and republish the data as Linked Data in order to boost the website SEO.Since then we pushed more than 250 releases to the WordPress Plugin Directory, adding new features, supporting new WordPress versions and features and we grew to hundreds of customers using it to get more visibility on the SERP.What happenedOn the 22nd of August we received a message from the WordPress Plugin Directory volunteers about a security report related to the WordLift Plugin 3.37, which would allow a WordPress administrator to insert html code in a WordLift configuration field.The original description of the issue:\"The plugin does not sanitise and escape its settings, allowing high privilege users such as admin to perform cross-Site Scripting attacks even when the unfiltered_html capability is disallowed.\"Further details about the report are available here (CVE) and here (WPScan).Because only an administrator could exploit it, the critical level of the security issue was considered low and we immediately pushed a patched version of the plugin to the WordPress Plugin Directory.However the report triggered a process where the WordLift plugin would go into a full review by the WordPress team. During this process the WordLift plugin would be temporary taken offline.The full review was deemed necessary because the initial report meant that WordLift is getting more traction, a larger customer base and may be considered a target.https://twitter.com/ziodave/status/1566675979866718209Other plugins like Yoast and RankMath have already 11 and 2 security reports each (last update, Sep 8, 2022).Our responseSoon after releasing a patched version, we worked with the WordPress team of volunteers to do a full review of the plugin and tighten its security between the 22nd of August and 7th of September 2022.https://twitter.com/ziodave/status/1566677521575415809?s=21&amp;t=ZTOT3O0vqBCX1C4eI_-j3gWe decided to take Jetpack as a reference for the review of WordLift plugin. Jetpack is a flagship plugin by Automattic and one of the most popular and used plugins. And like every WordPress plugin published in the directory it's open source.We looked at how Jetpack validates its code (or \"lint\" in technical jargon) and found a set of helpful rules that would scan the whole WordLift plugin to report from the critical issues to the formatting issues.So we ran the scan on WordLift and found quite some space for improvement (E means error):It took us about 2 weeks and 6 intermediate reviews by the WordPress volunteers team and 941 files changed, 39228 insertions, 35844 deletions to get down to this (dot means no errors):After the final review, on the 7th of September, the plugin was reopened to the public.Lessons learnedA lot has changed since we first published the WordLift plugin to the WordPress Plugin Directory 10 years ago.We were already in the process of restructuring our team to provide a better care to our WordLift plugin and this event gave us more stamina to move quickly forward with the following actions:Hire new team members to our product team to work on WordLift's plugin, bring new features and do cross code reviews (apply here).Adopt the best coding practices by integrating the code linting at every single code commit and enforcing these rules, which means use phpcs and apply the Jetpack rules at every single commit.Participate and contribute to other open source project, like the Pods Framework to integrate the best codes and share knowledge.FAQWhen was the WordLift plugin developed?WordLift development started in 2010.Is WordLift plugin being removed from the WordPress Plugin Directory?WordLift plugin has been temporary delisted between the 22nd of August and the 7th of September 2022 in order to perform and complete review and ensure its conformance with the latest standards. The plugin has been relisted on the 7th of September.Is WordLift safe?WordLift is safe. In more than 10 years only one security issue with a low security risk has been found, compared with 11 security issues in Yoast and 2 security issues in RankMath. Version 3.38.0 released the 7th of September 2022 contains an update conforming WordLift to the highest standard.What is the WordPress Plugin Directory?The WordPress Plugin Directory is a comprehensive list of WordPress plugins.

        "text": "Multilingual Product Knowledge Graph + Product Structured Data: the Secret SEO Success Formula Table of contents: Why is Google Opening Free Listings?What We Underestimate the Most as Search MarketersWhat Different Website Structures Mean for Search EnginesWhy the Merchant Feed is Not EnoughHow the Merchant Feed and Structured Data Work TogetherMultilingual Product Knowledge Graph or\u2026is Your SEO Strategy Graphy Then?Why Is Google Opening Free Listings?Google made a big move in 2020 after 8 years of adapting their pay-to-play model by opening shopping opportunities as free product listings for registered Google Merchant Center\u2019s users. A few days ago (13 September 2022) they even extended their enhanced product experiences to all users by using the product structured data markup which previously were available only to registered users in the initial phase.&nbsp;This absolutely proves that they really started to understand the e-commerce space: Google introduced these features after accepting that Amazon dominates as a product search engine for years. The idea is simple: provide the best shopping experience for everyone, no matter where people come from, how developed their business is, what type of industry they are operating in and whether they advertise on Google or not.&nbsp;We now have the product structured data in a combination with merchants\u2019 listing reporting and this is a pivotal change for e-commerce SEO reporting overall.&nbsp;Google\u2019s move represents a huge opportunity for all retailers, especially for many great small to medium size businesses given how much Google knows about commercial intents through Google Maps and Google Search in particular. By now, if you were a small retailer, you didn\u2019t have the space to compete with bigger companies because they had bigger budgets than you. However, from a customer\u2019s perspective today, it is not important where the product comes from as long as it provides what the client needs. Google understood this perfectly.&nbsp;That is why the priority now is not only to make a listing on Google but also provide as much metadata about these listings in order to get better search visibility across all Google\u2019s products.&nbsp;What We Underestimate The Most As Search MarketersSearch engines like Google need these details because they have hard time obtaining this data reliably and this is important when building their multilingual product knowledge graph. We as search marketers tend to think that this is a trivial task and underestimate the whole computer science and engineering investment that needs to be taken in order for the information retrieval process to work as it should. What seems to be trivial, is in fact a very complicated process of parsing and harvesting information, unifying it in a structured way for everyone. This is the primary reason why these free listings appeared in the first place - grasping data in a smarter and faster way than ever.&nbsp;What Different Website Structures Mean For Search EnginesLet\u2019s take an example of a random product listing. It contains multiple data touchpoints that we can use and optimize for:Ratings;Price;Savings;Shipping details;Related products;Questions and Answers;Manufacturer details;Different facets: color, size, brand, distributor\u2026If we look closely at Amazon, we can observe that the information extraction process is easier for them because they have specifically defined structured fields from which they obtain all this information directly and at scale. Google\u2019s way is more difficult because they obtain this information from many, many websites full of unstructured data and not just that: they need to make a sense out of this data by combining different parts together or skimming through what might be an unhelpful content.&nbsp;Now imagine that this information is partially available on other e-commerce stores which follow a different page structure, use different UI patterns and might even contain other metadata or visually-rich features like seeing the product in 3D. What will be the strategy to obtain this data from all these different stores at scale? This is where structured data fields and product structured data come into play.Why The Merchant Feed Is Not EnoughIn order to get a new product into Google Shopping, we can use the famous merchant feed, populate it with relevant data and provide it to Google Shopping. However, this is not enough in real life because Google likes providing 2 data-entry points to them:&nbsp;the merchant feed;the structured data (schema markup) and a syncing strategy between themselves.This is very useful for small businesses who offer their products with certain competitive advantages compared to bigger businesses, e.g. shorter delivery time or cheaper price and so on. They can get themselves featured on Google by exploiting the power of these 2 data-entry points. The more data you provide to Google, the bigger the business opportunity. What is even better is the fact that this data is universal, reusable and specifically owned by you directly (first-party data). That is why your product data is your business weapon that you can exploit to win new markets online.&nbsp;This might not be the case with Amazon because they can force you to \u201cadapt\u201d to their e-commerce and product strategy slowly over time. It is not a secret that the umpire is the player itself: researchers have found a bias in private label product recommendations where Amazon favored its own products beyond organic recommendations. This means losing control over your products, shopping experience and your own competitiveness - competing with endless products on a single platform or Amazon\u2019s products themselves.&nbsp;On the other side, when you have your own website, the data is yours and not Amazon\u2019s. Therefore, it will be quite strategic for you to sell there because you have the control over your data. You can do both Amazon and Google and even go beyond them. How great is that?How The Merchant Feed And Structured Data Work TogetherIt is important to understand that there are some things that we can do with the merchant feed and not with structured data, and vice versa, things that you can exploit with structured data and not with the merchant feed itself.This happens when we do not have mature schema markup for a particular purpose, while on the other hand the merchant feed does not have fields that can be contextually explained by existing schema markup types.Lately, there have been some challenges with the missing field \"priceType\" in the offers.priceSpecification attribute for the product structured data but Google is fixing this, so you don't need to worry about this error in the Merchant listings report anymore.In any case, the power of these 2 data entry points can provide more contextuality and thus an opportunity for you to outperform Amazon's product search experience. It is not just about providing more information about a product, it's about leveraging all the different platforms that Google has to reach targeted potential customers.We have found that many organizations have a wealth of data available in their content management systems (CMS), but are not using it. Chances are, you are doing the same thing because you lack a holistic SEO strategy that ties all this information together. Therefore, all this data remains buried somewhere in text descriptions in your own product catalogs.Remember, it is important to make your content explicitly available and pack it in a structured way that it is semantically understandable.Multilingual Product Knowledge Graph Or\u2026Is Your SEO Strategy Graphy Then?Given the aspect of cross-system interoperability and the ability to harness the power of product structured data, it makes sense to invest in a multilingual product knowledge graph that can organize your product metadata in a scientific way.A product graph models entities that you consume or want to buy, while a typical knowledge graph models general entities, their types, relations and so on.&nbsp;Here\u2019s an example of a product knowledge graph:Product knowledge graphs are a key business enablement: you can reuse this data for ads automation, SEO marketing intelligence but also for producing custom recommendations and even optimizing for Google Assistant for example. Natural language generation and natural language optimization are the second layer that can be built on top of that and with them. The possibilities for improvement are endless.&nbsp;The customer journey is a graph too. If you want to catch your customers on multiple levels and exclude duplication and assumptions from your strategy, the best way to meet your customer half-way on multiple touchpoints is to actually build a product knowledge graph in your organization.WordLift has built a stack of technologies to improve the data in these product knowledge graphs. Practice has taught us that product knowledge diagrams are absolutely essential if you want to improve your data harmonization, data reconciliation and knowledge cleansing, especially for multilingual and large e-commerce web platforms.Here\u2019s an example of the search performance of a client of ours before and after creating the product knowledge graph - the difference after the implementation is more than beneficial. Even though the initial SEO situation was not perfect and we had a lot of URL warnings and other technical SEO stuff that remained unsolved, the search impressions jumped after we added the PKG.To sum up, we build knowledge graphs as a basis for unconventional, next-gen SEO. That is why customers come to us - to create a knowledge graph for them so that we can automate SEO at different levels and that it is pretty unique: we\u2019re creating this PKG much like Google does and in a way that is native for them.&nbsp;To learn more about product structured data and how to build a multilingual product knowledge graph for your e-commerce website, watch the video with Jason Barnard and Doreid Haddad\ud83d\udc47https://youtu.be/yyRNpG7p_NU[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

A lot happens between the moment they realize they have a need or a desire for something and the moment they make a purchase\u201dRennie and Protheroe - Google\u2019s consumer insights team.During the time of the coronavirus, the percentage of online purchases has increased to record levels. And while the majority of purchases are still made offline, the media and information influencing those purchases are increasingly online, and the complexity of potential decision paths has increased dramatically.&nbsp;How do consumers decide what to buy and from whom to buy it? Because of the wide variety and availability of information and products on the web, the user may make several visits before actually buying anything. He goes in and out of different stores, comes back to look a second time, and then a third time to take full advantage of the Internet. That's the reality of Internet shopping today.&nbsp;To understand how Internet users interpret and manage the increasing information and choices available for online and offline purchases, Google researchers identified the messy middle, a specific area within the maze of searches, ads, links and clicks that play a role in purchasing.In this model, between the two poles of trigger and purchase lies an intermediate stage in which consumers move between exploring and evaluating available options until they are ready to buy. This process takes place against the backdrop of exposure, which represents all the buyer's thoughts, feelings, and perceptions about categories, brands, products, and retailers. The purchase is followed by the experience with the brand and the product, which feeds into the sum of the display. You must learn to navigate this maze to develop an effective marketing strategy to grow your business and outperform your competition.Messy Middle And Search Intent In SEOUnderstanding the messy middle is an essential step in determining an effective marketing strategy. But it's not enough. In SEO, the goal is to give visibility to content by appearing among the first search results in Google's SERP. To achieve this, it is first important to know what the user's search intent is when they are on the path to purchase. Starting with the messy middle, we have analyzed the search intent in each of the phases that make up this new model.&nbsp;In particular, we found that in the exploration phase, the predominant search intentions are informational and navigational. Namely, the user is looking for information about the \"what\", \"how\", and \"who\". In the evaluation phase, the predominant search intentions are commercial and transactional. In this second part of their journey, the user is getting closer to buying and is therefore looking for information about the \"best\" and the best offers for that particular product or service.&nbsp;Based on this analysis, I'll show you an example of SEO content optimization and explain how you too can use semantic keyword research to create content that ranks better on Google, generating more conversions and therefore sales!How To Rank On The First Page Of Google With Semantic Keyword ResearchIn this case, I started with the search query I wanted to cover and for which I wanted my content to appear in Google's SERP. By analyzing the search intent and the messy middle, I was able to determine the user's position within the customer journey.Query: best seo plugin for woocommerce&nbsp;As you can see, we are in the evaluation phase: the user wants to understand what the best solution is for their needs. In this case, that need means he's looking for the best plug-in for SEO in WooCommerce. So we are in the commercial search intent. This gives me a clear indication of what kind of content I need to create.To optimize my content in terms of SEO, I performed semantic keyword research. For this I used the SEO Add-on for Google Sheets\u2122 by WordLift. Let us discuss in detail how I used it and what I could do with it for SEO content optimization.How I used the SEO Add-on by WordLiftSEO Add-on for Google Sheets\u2122 by WordLift is the extension that lets you perform semantic keyword research and create a JSON-LD to help Google understand what your content is about.&nbsp;In a few simple steps, you can install the extension and analyze the SERP to find out which search queries rank higher on Google. I select the search queries for which I want to rank and run the analysis to see which one ranks better on Google.Then I went to see the SERP analysis. Here are two important things that the SEO add-on helps me understand and take action to optimize my content.First, it allows me to identify entities that are already in my vocabulary. In this case, to improve my SEO content optimization, I can insert links from these entities to my content in a way that creates a semantic path for Google to better index my article and thus gain more visibility. It is important that the entities from which I create internal links to my content are relevant and already indexed by the search engine, in order to create a cluster of relevant links around the topic I am talking about and strengthen my topical authority.On the other hand, it helps me identify new relevant entities that are not yet in my vocabulary. In this case, I can add the entities to the vocabulary, paraphrase the content by adding a mention of these entities, and add the annotation.What result did I get with semantic keyword analysis and SEO Add-on by WordLift?My content ranks first in the Google SERP with Top Rich Snippets. This ranking has had a positive impact on conversions: in the weeks following the article's publication, sales of our WooCommerce plugin increased!What Results Can You Get With Semantic Keyword Research?As you have seen, this is an example of entity based SEO. It shows that semantic keyword research and analysis can help us optimize our content, both new content and content we have already published.

        "text": "The Impact Of Semantic Annotation: Poem Analysis Case Study How can we organize the taxonomy of a website to make it easier to find in search engines? What can we do with entities and what can we expect when we annotate content with them? This is the story of William Green, who founded Poem Analysis in 2016 with the goal of giving poetry a home online. William had noticed that there were not enough online resources about poetry and that people were still struggling to understand and appreciate it because they were not being helped to study it in depth.The first important step was to create a well-organized website. But, as we know, a website without visibility is like an empty house. So, the biggest challenge at that time was to gain more and more visibility on Google and the search engines. So while a website must be designed for the user, the content that fills it must also be understandable to search engines. In this way, Google can index it and the website can get a good ranking that will bring it more visitors.When William came across WordLift, he knew there was untapped potential here. He knew Schema.org and had already tried solutions that allowed him to annotate content and add structured data to the website, but he had not yet found the solution that could really make a difference.\u00a0Let's see closer this SEO case study. WordLift brought its innovation, both in approach and technology.&nbsp;\u201cThe ability to add entities on a scale like no other is something that every website owner should get excited about. Helping Google understand content better, and make the links, will only benefit the website, where schema is becoming a more dominant force for search engines, and into the future.It was and is a pleasure to work with WordLift on cutting-edge SEO, particularly with such a quick thinking an Agile team. In doing so, we are able to test and create experiments that produce incredible results before most have even read new SEO schemas\u201dWilliam Green - Poem AnalysisThe challengeThe goal of Poem Analysis was to achieve better ranking on Google and search engines and get more organic traffic to the website. The real challenge was to find a solution that would scale quickly and systematically given the large amount of content on the site.&nbsp;It was also about increasing relevancy, making sure that Google was able to capture the right queries. It seems obvious at the beginning but, really, it is not when you look at each individual poem. Google might know who Allen Ginsberg is but might struggle to connect \u2018Howl\u2019 (one of Allen's poems) to him.The solutionFor PoemAnalysis.com we used a version of WordLift specifically created for publishers in the&nbsp;CafeMedia/AdThrive network.&nbsp;The solution proposed by the WordLift team started from the idea of using the pre-existing taxonomy and to integrate and inject structured data through \u201cmatch terms\u201d. This means that you can enrich your site by using categories and tags without having to use WordLift's content classification panel to add markup. This way, a tag or category is treated like a recognized entity in the content classification box.&nbsp;For PoemAnalysis.com we created a custom solution to achieve this goal and in this way, we used the well organized taxonomy of the websites to associate the entity correspondent to the category of the poet (e.i. The category of&nbsp; William Shakespeare has been associated with the Wikidata correspondent entity). Specifically, this was done here with Authors.In a second testing phase, we decided to add the SameAs of the poem to the page of the poem (e.i. Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnet 19 associated with the correspondent wikidata and DBPedia). The items we marked in the SameAs field are converted by WordLift into meaningful links to Wikidata and DBpedia. Subsequently, the Poem Analysis editorial team added SameAs to all entities on the site.We are now working to add \"Quiz\" markup for Education Q&amp;A, a format that helps students better find answers to educational questions. With structured data, the content is eligible to appear in the Education Q&amp;A carousel in Google Search, Google Assistant, and Google Lens results. Stay tuned!The resultsAs we saw in the previous section, the WordLift team worked on two actions that had a positive and measurable impact on Poem Analysis' SEO strategy.&nbsp;In the first case, the existing, well-organized taxonomy was used with the \u201cMatch Terms\u201d feature to convert categories into entities, which were then annotated in the site content. To measure the impact of this first experiment, a control group was created that included a set of unannotated Poets with WordLift markup.The semantic annotation brought +13% of clicks and +29.3% of impressions when comparing this year to last year. In this case, we did not include the control group, because after we did follow-ups for these URLs as well, the data is not statistically relevant at the moment (in the expansion of the experiment we moved most of the URLs of the control group into the variant group, so to date, only 5 URLs remain within the control group).In the second case, the WordLift team worked on SameAs of the poem to the page of the Poem. Again, to measure impact, we created a control group containing a set of Poems not annotated. Using SameAS brought +59.3% of clicks and +82.9% of impressions.&nbsp;The semantic annotation of the content also allowed another result: if you type the whole poem in Google, the first result that appears is poem analysis\ud83e\udd29Example: William Shakespeare\u2019s Sonnet 19&nbsp;ConclusionThe story of William shows the impact of semantic annotation and how building a well-organized taxonomy helps semantic annotation of content have a positive impact on a website's impressions and traffic.&nbsp;In this case, we used the well-structured and indexed tags and categories as entities to annotate the website content. Generally, it is important that the entities are relevant and indexed by search engines to create the right sidewalk that moves both Google and the user.&nbsp;Let us not forget that semantic content annotations add value to the user by providing them with information and insights that they would otherwise have to look for elsewhere. And, of course, it also creates a semantic path for Google, which can thus more easily assemble the concepts surrounding a piece of content and rank it by reinforcing the topical authority on that topic.[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "Content Resilience Is Business Resilience: A Lesson From 1600+ Articles Table of contents: Content resilience\u2026what does that even mean?Processes, frameworks, mindsets and knowledge graphs as content resilience enablersResilience in your SEO content strategyCovid-19. Inflations. Remote work. New competitors in the market or more competitive business offerings from others in your niche. We have all been there, at least in recent years. One lesson we should have learned by now is how to make ourselves and our businesses more resilient and adaptable to change.Business resilience is complex and it cannot be built overnight. It requires careful organizational structuring which equally values efficiency and innovation, while ensuring quality supply chain resilience at the same time. You should be able to deliver your products and services to the market in a way that is constant and suffers little change even when the times are uncertain and the market is fluctuating across industries.&nbsp;This is where your content and marketing strategy come into play. They should be your most important tools for resilience because they allow you to discover your customers and bring them into your business. They are the tools that guide your online visitors between the awareness and purchase stages, giving you the ultimate data to learn how to improve your offerings and unique selling proposition:Where did your visitors come from?What devices are they using to find you?What makes them stick on the website or leave it immediately?What does their customer journey on your website look like?Do you have a mature branding strategy (brand queries dominate) or do you have a pure, established organic growth marketing channel in place?So much more.This is why your business teams need to embrace the power of content and learn how to keep going further even when the going becomes tougher.Content Resilience\u2026What Does That Even Mean?It all comes down to the mindset.First things first: your content comes from many places or ideally multiple departments should be able to inform your content strategy. By gathering and unifying data from there, you should be able to answer questions like:Who are your searchers?Who are your customers and how did they convert? Which search queries are the most impactful when it comes to converting online and why?What increases the desirability of your product/service?What helps to reduce the friction in closing deals?How do prospects behave when they use the product/service?What established processes and conventions are established at your company, so that you can make a constant user discovery process?How can you present your information so that you have a clear and well articulated way to change your prospects minds, making them switch to your business solutions?In the content world, the ability to find a new way to understand and profile your audience, and at the same time the ability to present a new talking point and a new type of content, is called content resilience. This comes with time and practice, but it's important to start and plan for it.You must be able to find inspiration by taking data from multiple data sources: it\u2019s all about being data-driven but also imaginative, innovative and deeply, deeply interested to understand the customers in the first phases of the buying journey in order to guide them properly later.Processes, Frameworks, Mindsets And Knowledge Graphs As Content Resilience EnablersAnalyze what you have on your side. Start documenting your work and then try to find the minimum denomination which applies to all of your content templates. Being able to put structure where there\u2019s none and even more, giving granularity and interoperability to your data is an ultimate content resilience skill:We build knowledge graphs (KG) to provide structure to content;Structure is what is needed to build resilience;AI (still) depends on vast amount of training data - structure helps us scale this training data to \u201cteach\u201d search engines new things and help them find the audience we need;The return of investment (ROI) of a content KG depends on the value of the semantic annotations over time;The value of semantic annotations is to bridge gaps with the right searchers\u2019 personas;A content that is semantically annotated gets stronger over time. Why? Because it enforces interconnectedness among concepts across the web and it becomes semantically understandable what your website is about.And yes\u2026it takes domain expertise but also great business acumen with an innovative mind to start connecting the dots that were thrown away without any framework behind. Build your foundations just like you would build with LEGO blocks and utilize the power of content knowledge graphs: a blog post on social media lasts for a few hours while an entity-based content strategy (entity mapping) lasts forever.&nbsp;Here is an analysis above on 1650+ articles of a client of ours and this is the click through rate (CTR) when we stopped adding new entities. As you can observe, the result goes down once we stop the entity tagging process.&nbsp;Know the advantages and disadvantages of different content approaches. It is an ultimate superpower.Resilience In Your SEO Content StrategyWe won\u2019t make a mistake if we say that content strategy is your first phase of your supply chain process - you\u2019re distributing information to online searchers so that they can make a proper decision on what to buy online. It can get hard if you don\u2019t strategize around your content strategy and understand your unique value proposition inside out.Your numbers are not adding up at the moment or the executives are not satisfied with the results that they see? Period. If your content is set up to succeed, those are just temporary turbulent periods that you need to overcome and be sure, the sun is there afterwards! They come from time to time, it is a learned skill that helps manage everyone\u2019s expectations. How? Well, here\u2019s the deal: 1.Working with backlinksIf you work with backlinks and you are not a seasoned SEO marketer, you will have tough times articulating your strategic decisions to upper management. It is very likely that you might think that investing time in building high domain authority links to your website is beneficial.&nbsp;The problem with links is that they expire and become old or completely obsolete over time. Completely unresilient. They don\u2019t hold value for long, especially if you are not updating them up at scale. It\u2019s not that you do not need them or that you should ditch them, it is more about being more strategic: investing in classic links but also investing in linked-data links, enabling global shared understanding about concepts across the globe. That\u2019s content resilience. That\u2019s link resilience.2. Being evergreenAre your content ideas up-to-date? Do you truly, deeply understand your customers? What are some problems that keep popping up all the time or from time to time? What do knowledge graphs across the web teach you about content gaps? Can you fill them to address these issues? Are they evergreen and will this content be reusable when winning new audiences on the Internet over and over again? Be specific and brutally honest to yourself about being evergreen - it is the only way to go forward.&nbsp;3. Flexible mindsetAre you a flexible person? Are you able to construct and deconstruct content pieces from ground up and vice versa? Are you able to put new perspectives and fresh, indie thinking into how you keep elements in your core content processes? Are you learning and experimenting with new stuff? One potential idea is working with product knowledge graphs. Have you considered these approaches before? Resilience is adapting to change and if you do not have a flexible mind, you will face difficulties along the way.4. Third-party SEO vendorsThese tools support your keyword research process and link profiling between your website and competitors\u2019 websites, however, they are not reliable in the long run.&nbsp;Being dependent on SEO software vendors that do not even work with first-party data and slowly increase the prices of their products is not a resilient-oriented way of thinking. You should build your safety net around the data that you own in the first place, like Google Search console data source and unstructured data in your CMS. Your tech stack should be picked in a way that enables you to grow from there and not be strategically dependent on third-party SEO data vendors.To sum up, it is important to build your foundations right. Put your data in context. Build around what you already have and then expand from there. You\u2019ll thank us later.Ready to experiment? Give us a go!

        "text": "The Lifecycle [and the Death] of SEO Content Documents As We Know Them Table of contents: Documents are getting old\u2026or is it the approach itself?Documents are not fundamentally efficientDocuments as learning toolsDocuments as a audience development tool, sales enablement and science impact without boundariesNext-gen documents are FAIRDigital natives experienced the birth and the death of regular content documents.If you are like me, you bought your first computer in the 90s and performed your first searches in a text-based browser. Back then, it was not easy to be visionary, because no one knew what direction the web would take, even though we were always excited by the idea of connecting people, knowledge and opportunities as efficiently as possible. At least, that was supposed to be our manifesto.Documents Are Getting Old\u2026or Is It The Approach Itself?But something does not seem right. The way we used (and still do!) to interact with SEO content documents (articles, blog posts, research papers, whitepapers, webpages, whatever you call them) was:Make a research about what needs to be written;Write the article (or document existing work);Publish it and/or share it through your content distribution channels;Set and forget approach: once you\u2019re done, the article stays in the back.Or re-optimize when (and IF) the time is right, if the resources and the demand allow you to do so as well.Documents Are Not Fundamentally EfficientIt turns out that SEO documents are anachronistic for most of their life: Once they have satisfied transient user needs, they are either deleted from the system entirely or content teams forget about them because they do not benefit the user. They are deemed obsolete, which results in them not reaching their full potential. And believe me, their potential is enormous if only they were properly semantically tagged and modularized, as they should have been from the start.If we could just change that logic and start seeing them as islands of knowledge, we could take advantage of more than 3 sites: Voice (Chatbots), Automation (Content Operations) and Knowledge Exploration across the web (Linked Data). This has not been possible until now:Behavior changes were happening very slowly;We didn\u2019t have the right, democratized technology in place;We were in the early stage of fostering knowledge developers positions on the job market.Documents As Learning ToolsGiven the multiple touch points and interactions with content, we need to shift to this new way of thinking about SEO documents to discover the ultimate truths about the world around us beyond a tiny fraction of what's out there. That's the power of functional, effective content documents: exploring new worlds of knowledge that are yet to be discovered - just like new lands in ancient times.A document is a magnificent structure that we can only imperfectly understand because we as humans are limited in our ability to reuse and analyze it in a variety of ways, as machines can. Content documents are a tool to express opinions, but also an exploration that allows us to discover new facts about the world around us. They are tools that help us satisfy our desire for more knowledge.To go beyond what is known, we need to think critically about our current SEO document content operations, systems, and overall strategy for developing SEO content documents over time. Imagine a world where we can work more cohesively with everyone and help others solve their problems through the intelligent use of SEO document content. It's no longer about dealing with Big Data: from now on, smart data counts through smart content engineering.Documents As A Audience Development Tool, Sales Enablement And Science Impact Without BoundariesInterconnected worlds of data are not primarily limited by language comprehension but rather lack of structure. They are limited by not being organized in your content management systems (CMSs) according to WWW standards which limits their usability and discovery potential over time.So imagine you are an entrepreneur with a limited budget selling your services online via content marketing, or a researcher looking to find a way to cure disease. Even though they are two different professions, both face the same challenge in practice: they both lack comprehensive sales channels to promote their services, get funding, or uncover new facts. The process of document creation and SEO document dissemination is very manual:You would go to a given search engine or social media.You use some marketing techniques (ads, SEO, search operators) to promote your work or target platforms for prospect opportunities and/or search for related papers.You search for foundations and NGOs that can fund your work.Very, very manual. It's not just about automation, it's about a better approach to how we share knowledge and promote things so that each document is a valuable node in the world of the open knowledge graph. This is a critical factor in finding cures for diseases and supporting online document distribution channels. Therefore.Next-Gen SEO Documents Are FAIRThe concept of FAIR data is not new. FAIR stands for findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. These principles enable machine usability: \"the capacity of computational systems to work with data with no or minimal human intervention.\"Even though this concept has been around for some time and was first introduced in the world of research, we can apply the same logic to any SEO content document that exists. Watch the video below to learn more about it\ud83d\udc47https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OeCrQE3HhEIn this way, the value of SEO content documents will never go away, because the way they are created and maintained is evergreen and strategically different than before. They are:True to their original intent, so their purpose is clear and to the point.Modular, so that can be reorganized and redistributed in different and multiple ways.Accessible, no matter the spoken language that it is used.Measurable and testable, so it\u2019s easy to restructure them as needed.Trackable and self-describing: you can query and analyze them in the Linked-Open-Data world.How To Get Perfect SEO Content DocumentsIf you want to apply these principles to your SEO content documents, you can start with the following:Our SEO Add-On for Google Sheets\u2122 - by using it you can look at the SERP by analyzing unique entities that characterize each search query (and intent).Bring this same layer of metadata (entities) inside your own knowledge graph that can be created by using cutting-edge techniques that we employ here at WordLift.Integrate the entities in your publishing workflow by adding a unique identifier to each document, to each author and to each relevant content piece (example: in our Knowledge Graph a FAQ has its own ID).[et_pb_section global_module=\"20980\"][/et_pb_section][wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "Top 5 Underutilized Schema Markups for Publishers Table of contents: What are the most common schema markups for publishers?What are the least common, underutilized schema markups for publishers?What are some potentially useful schema markups that I can watch out for in the future?The news and blogging industry is not an easy profession. Anyone who has had the opportunity to participate in these article-driven businesses will tell you that it is a very dynamic, competitive and time-sensitive industry - you do not have much time to get your bearings. News articles and events come and go, and readers' attention spans are short. That's why it's important to optimize your content as soon as it's fresh and interesting to your audience. Especially for those who want to report live or are serious about being in the newsroom.Google's VP Scott Huffman will say that \"discoverability is not a solved problem.\" That's why we analyzed more than 100 web platforms of news, blogs and magazines such as BBC, BILD, Blick, NYTimes, TNW, SmashingMagazine, CNN, DW, AL Jazeera, Google News and the personal websites of renowned SEOs and identified the most common, but also the most useful (but less known) schema markups for publishers.We, as schema markup experts, pioneers in using artificial intelligence to grow online audiences and first-to-market content organization, feel the need to share our findings with the wider SEO industry, because we fight for:Open and linked-data knowledge that everyone can benefit from;Helping to establish quality competition which will directly increase the quality of the content that we provide online;Work together with WWW, Schema.org and general schema markup enthusiasts towards making the Internet better, one day at the time;So much more.What Are The Most Common Schema Markups For Article-Oriented Websites?Assuming you have regular workflows for producing and publishing content, you may have dealt with the Article, NewsArticle, and BreadcrumbList schema markups. What are the differences between them and what exactly are they used for? Let us take a look at them together.Article is a general type of schema markup, mostly used for magazines\u2019 creative work. As stated on Schema.org, \u201cnewspapers and magazines have articles of many different types and this is intended to cover them all\u201d. When it is hard to determine the schema category for your content piece, it is always a great idea to start with Article schema markup;NewsArticle is a schema markup used to report on news or in other words articles that are produced by an established news organization. The NewsArticle schema represents a type of creative work and it formally inherits the Article schema while being more specific than the Article schema itself. NewsArticle schema markup works best when it is accompanied with the following attributes:backstory - a brief explanation of why and how an article was created;articleSection - the news category for the given article;speakable - usually to highlight the most important parts of the article or indicate parts which are the most likely to be useful for general speech purposes (text-to-speech);abstract - a short summary about the article and particularly useful when combined with entity referencing and entity tagging by using the mentions attribute;accountablePerson - the person who is responsible for producing the creative work;award - recognitions for the given article;contributor - referencing additional co-authors and helpers for the piece to be properly produced;conditionsOfAccess - explains the rules for accessing the content, e.g. \"Available by appointment from the Reading Room\" or \"Accessible only from logged-in accounts \".BreadcrumbList - it represents a chain of interconnected webpages, indicating the hierarchy for accessing each one of them. Useful for big websites or category-based websites which need to explain their navigation to users and search engines.Combining accountablePerson, award and contributor attributes helps in building Expertise-Authority-Trust (EAT) for your creative work which is particularly useful after Google's Helpful Content Update. It is always great when we can provide more context to search engines about the author and his/hers expertise to write the content. Basically, E-A-T is best developed when we can positively answer questions like:When searchers explore content to solve their needs, will they put their trust into your business and expertise provided?Does the content itself demonstrates first-hand expertise and showcases good structure and clear purpose?Will the users satisfy their searching needs after absorbing your creative work?While E-A-T itself is not a direct ranking factor, it is still a framework that encompasses many clues that Google picks up on to evaluate and further elevate quality content. Therefore, it's a good idea to develop a solid knowledge graph and link between your authors' expertise and your niche topics.Here are some results that we observed when implementing some of the previous schema markups for publishers to our clients\u2019 websites:As you can see from the bar chart, annotated articles outperformed non-annotated articles by about 17%. This is a huge improvement, especially for large publishers, but also useful for small authors optimizing their audience.[et_pb_section global_module=\"20980\"][/et_pb_section]What Are The Least Common, Underutilized Schema Markups For Publishers?The news &amp; article webspace is definitely not using the full power of available, non-pending schema markups, including FAQ page, How to, VideoObject, Person,LiveBlogPosting, Thing for entities (entity linking), TVEpisode, TVSeries, CollectionPage, Series, CreativeWork (Whitepapers, Books), Event, PodcastEpisode. We are going to cover only some of them.PersonPerson is more descriptive than accountablePerson or the contributor attribute, because it provides more context-fields to describe the author like:alumniOf - any connection with formal and informal education institutions that can demonstrate author\u2019s competencies is useful to be provided;award - a list of concrete achievements that this person managed to secure during its lifetime, think \u201cBest investigative story\u201d for reporters, mentions in relevant associations and so on;jobTitle - explains the exact job title that the content piece\u2019s author holds, like Editor in Chief or a more regular reporter. Use this to differentiate;knowsAbout - used for expertise building, covering the topics in which the person is expert in;sameAs attribute - this one is relatively known for local businesses but rarely appropriately utilized for Person\u2019s schema markup. Use it to connect to relevant social media profiles for the author and anything that can help in disambiguating its entity across the web.All of these extension, context-based ideas are not possible or easy to achieve with simple contributors or accountablePersons attributes alone.LiveBlogPostingLiveBlogPosting is useful when you need to perform an ongoing textual coverage for events that are ongoing and require continuous updates. Think hostage situations, earthquakes, ongoing wars or political elections - most of them are types of events that happen in a defined time interval and are a hot topic for some days and weeks (excluding war situations which are absolutely more complex than that).Therefore, a typical Article or Blog schema will not be sufficient in these cases. It is also important to note that Google might feature top stories with a live badge when adding this schema, so it is definitely worth it to give it a try.TVEpisode and TVSeriesTVEpisode and TVSeries are interesting schema markups and particularly useful when websites are performing some sort of TV broadcast and related online content delivery. You can also think of reportages for TV shows like the Bachelor (example: Blick.ch regularly reports on these ones) - it is not a reportage, analysis or typical news article, so it should be appropriately differentiated.SeriesSeries is absolutely different compared to TV series (these two should not be mixed up) and it is usually used to connect a group of related items which do not have to belong in the same category or be of the same type. They are useful where there is not an established strict order in which the items should be shown but still require a certain structure to be interconnected together. In practice, you can observe the Kevin Indig\u2019s blog utilizes this schema markup very cleverly:He writes long-form articles that belong to different topics but still fall under the global SEO topic, ranging from SEO team structures and up to rocking SEO in the machine learning world;Since there is not an established, clear hierarchical structure between the articles, he uses the Series schema markup to connect all these blog-posts together in a series;The Series schema helps with content comprehension but also content referral and building a powerful article recommendation engine.It is simple but still way to underutilized according to our study.What Are Some Potentially Useful Schema Markups That I Can Watch Out For In The Future?In some contexts fact checking is important to be done and adding content-based schemas helps in these initiatives: first we need to gather the data in a structured way and then act on it appropriately. There are important initiatives around in the media space that are working in this direction like the Fact Checker tools by Google to help spot misinformation.At the same time, Schema.org and linked-data knowledge enthusiasts regularly invest time in developing additional schema markups that describe various web concepts on the Internet more accurately. Here are some of the schema markups that are under development and once they are approved, can bring new added value to your business:NewsMediaOrganization, ReportageNewsArticle, AnalysisNewsArticle, OpinionNewsArticle, ReviewNewsArticle, BackgroundNewsArticle, AdvertiserContentArticle, SatiricalArticle, BroadcastEvent are absolutely some interesting schema markups to watch after. However, they are still in the pending phase and still wait to be implemented.What schema markups are you using for your article-based business? Are you utilizing their power enough?

        "text": "How To Optimize Existing Content With Entities, Semantic SEO, &amp; All Things Nice! In content marketing, we would leave no stone unturned to ensure that our content reaches the right person - one who is looking for a solution. Some of us can remember the days when we wrote article after article, just like SEOwl shows here.https://giphy.com/gifs/seo-seowl-jqZ75GFugv6xqgs3HNContent calendar, pillar pages, keyword clustering, content distribution, competitor analysis, social media\u2026 Wait a minute! What about your current content that is waiting for a makeover? If these activities have been lost in your To-Do Lists or Trello boards, now is the time to pick them up again!For some of our clients, depending on their specific goals and OKRs, we have planned some revitalization activities. Let us see how to optimize existing content and how we worked out in two cases. Case I: Almost Dead PageWe had fluctuating impressions that rarely translated into results. After the changes, we can see how impressions have increased by more than five times and clicks by six times. That's a start, of course! Not to mention how well the page climbed up the SERP ladder\u26a1Case II: Stagnated PageThe webpage had reached a plateau before we started semantic SEO enrichment. As the numbers show, clicks have doubled over time and we are seeing an increase in trends.Let's go through how to optimize your existing content, identify the relevant opportunities and then give them a spin, the semantic SEO way!Optimize Your Existing Content, The Semantic SEO Way!Whenever we have a new client on board, their goal is to increase business value through SEO. This can be done by improving content, improving their E-A-T ( Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness ) on the web, and making the most of structured data, to name a few examples. Whether it is one or all of these, Semantic SEO is at the heart of all our efforts.As for content, optimizing existing content on the site goes hand in hand with brainstorming fresh content ideas. Sherlock-Holming The SERPAs always, we start by identifying the content opportunities in Search Console. In most cases, these are search queries with few clicks and many impressions just waiting to be tapped.Once we have identified the relevant search queries and the URLs that need to be revised, it's time to analyze the content gap - one page at a time. The SERP is one of the best places to understand this.As you may have already done, analyzing your competitors is a good place to start to find out if your content is missing something crucial. Or if there's room for improvement.The results shown will help you get closer to user intent and make sense of the content clusters you have. No wonder, the better you address intent, the better your content is likely to perform.Tools like Semrush are also good-to-rely sources to explore new content additions to the existing page. For example, some of the queries \"what is the difference between cheetah and leopard and jaguar\", \"what is the bite force of a jaguar\", and \"what is the speed of a jaguar\" are high-intent, long-tail, and comparatively easier to rank for.What\u2019s more?Hola, Entities!Does the content revival stop with SERP analysis, more keyword research and competitor analysis? Not quite! There\u2019s so much more you can do with entities.For those who are new to entities, in the Semantic Web, an entity is a \u201cthing\u201d that:can be described easily,could be unique,is distinguishable &amp; well-defined.It could be our favorite music star, the next vacation destination we are planning, or our favorite dish. An entity helps computers understand everything you know about a person, organization, or place.For example, if you are a car dealer, your website must help Google understand that Jaguar is the car for you, not the threatening jungle cat.With entity-based SEO, this is a cakewalk!Entities can also lead you to highly relevant topics that can benefit your business. This in turn increases your thematic authority with strong content clustersNow, of course, the question is: How do I find entities?Using SEO Add-on for Google Sheets\u2122by WordLiftSEO Add-on for Google Sheets\u2122by WordLift is an extension that lets you perform semantic keyword research and create a JSON-LD that helps Google understand what your content is about.The SEO Add-on comes in super handy even if you are creating a new content piece or reviving an existing one. Let me walk you through how we use it to enrich a page with entities and implement SEO content optimization.1. In your Google Sheets, get the WordLift Add-on under Extensions&gt;&gt;Add-ons&gt;&gt;Get Add-ons. Search for WordLift, and you are good!2. To use the Add-on, you need a WordLift key. If you are already a customer, you can use your key as such. If not, drop us a message, and we\u2019ll help you out.3. You can either run the SEO Add-on with a set of queries or connect your Google Search Console account to get the data automatically.&nbsp;4. Here, I have a set of keywords for the best travel suitcases.&nbsp;5. You can go a step further and create clusters to better identify content opportunities. The fab tool Keyword Clustering App by Charly Wargnier is what we use.&nbsp;6. From the clusters, choose the keywords and queries that are relevant to your content plan. Open the extension, and choose \u2018Analyze SERP.\u20197. Voila! The SEO Add-on analyzes the queries you have selected, goes through the SERP, and brings you a list of entities and their DBpedia URL. Oh, and a confidence score denoting relevancy. A higher confidence score indicates that the entity is relevant to your content. Although, this is completely your choice.8. From the list, we can see some of the entities that are super relevant to the article we are writing - travel &amp; suitcase, for instance. You can also note entities such as Polycarbonate that you can cover when it comes to the material of the suitcase. The same goes for the brand Samsonite.- In short, when search engines crawl this article, it becomes apparent with these entities that you are talking about travel suitcases, the types, different brands, and more! Make it easy for bots to understand your content.9. As a final step, you can proceed to Login into your WordPress account, and import these entities to build your Knowledge Graph, wrapping up the process. Alternatively, you can use the data and create the entities on your own, in WordPress, via WordLift\u2019s plugin.Simplifying InterlinkingInternal linking is quite underrated; the rush to build backlinks and the countless deployments every day outweigh this. For smaller websites, internal linking may be a no-brainer. But what about an e-commerce site with more than 50,000 visitors? Err.Definitely not impossible, just time consuming.Is there a way we can do this faster? And with fewer resources? But of course, yes!When we add entities in WordLift, an internal link is automatically created. And not only that, you can turn this feature off whenever you want.If you have a product page, we want to add the product label first, which gives relevant details like availability, price, shipping details and moreIf you mention the product on your follow-up pages, the WordLift plugin will capture those mentions and allow you to mark them as entities and add an internal link.If you have a website with thousands of pages and products, imagine how things can be simplified, how you can save time and how your team can speed things up without compromising the bottom line!Propelling FAQsEarlier this year, there were several decisions that said Google has started displaying more Rich Results in the SERP and that the importance of Q&amp;A and FAQ schema markup is magnificently increasing. While earlier you had a chance to get a position in the \"People Also Ask\" section, Google's core update in May this year helped many website owners to get more space in the SERP with their FAQs.What are some of the best sources for FAQs?Questions posed by your customers to your sales or CS teamsGoogle\u2019s People Also AskGoogle\u2019s dropdown for search and related queriesTools like AlsoAsked.com helps you map what users are searching for, relating to a particular query/topic.Tools like Semrush offer questions asked by users when it comes to keyword research, making it easy for us to identify some high-intent, low-competition keywords to potentially target.Of course, it's not a good idea to force FAQs on all pages in the hope that they will rank well. Depending on the goal of the article and its intention, it's worth checking if you can accommodate questions and answers on the page.That's about it!Want the growing charts and numbers for your website or more (even better!)? Let us talk about it!Until next time with another blog, Hey Ho, Let's SEO\ud83e\udd1f[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

WordLift is happy to announce a new member of the team \u2013 Kim Renberg \ud83d\udc99Quick FactsName: Kim RenbergAge: 58Position in WordLift: Sales AdministratorLanguages spoken: English, Italian, DanishLet\u2019s Get to Know KimTell us more about yourself\u2026I was born in Denmark and have lived half my life in Italy, mainly in Rome. Over the years I have become a kind of hybrid, mixing the two cultures. The Italians experience me as Nordic and the Danes as Mediterranean.I have a very broad professional background and interests: I have a master's degree in public administration from Denmark, I have worked as an export manager in the Italian automotive industry, I have worked as a project manager in the Italian MICE and travel industry, and I have taken on several roles in the digital media industry.Throughout my professional life, I have always worked with people from different cultural backgrounds from many countries around the world. This is always an inspiring experience that I enjoy very much. Organizing business activities across multiple local, business and even corporate cultures is a great challenge that I enjoy very much - and making it even more successful.In the field of digital media, SEO has always been my main interest. I have been working with SEO since 2000. One of my first challenges was AltaVista, now it's as good as Google. I believe SEO should be an important part of any content marketing project. So I find WordLift's ambition to push modern SEO into the realm of structured data and semantic markup very exciting.3 things you love the most about being a WordLifter\ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0fI enjoy organizing sales efforts and helping organizations and businesses use WordLift tools, services and solutions in the best way possible.I love selling highly innovative technologies with WordLift's multidisciplinary team, which has strong expertise in search engine optimization. It's a great experience to be part of the commercial rollout and add business value to our global customers.Finally, I find it stimulating to work in an innovative environment with smart people. I learn new things every day. Before I started at WordLift, I did not know much about e-commerce and AI-generated content. Now it's part of my everyday work.And then one more thing. WordLift as a company works with many other innovative professionals, organizations and companies in many countries. Working at WordLift means being part of something bigger that's happening all over the world.Can you share exciting innovative tools that you\u2019re using at WordLift?Well, I use the WordLift WordPress plugin myself as a travel blogger. The blog is written in Danish and aims to sell Rome as a travel destination to Danish individual travelers. I have been using WordLift since before I joined the company. Dealing with a destination means that keyword searches are often inefficient and competition is high. Tourist places have names you can not get around. You need to rank for their official names.Working with structured data and semantic markup has been a spectacular experience for me. Even a small blog can benefit from WordLift technology. After a few months I found my posts on good page 1 positions in Google SERP, with FAQ schema markup I got good results on 'people also ask' and I even found some rich snippets at the top of SERP.I definitely found that structured data is not just a matter for big companies, but this innovative tool is suitable for everyone, including blogs and small businesses.[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "New E-commerce Rich Result Types That You Can Actually Trigger Table of contents: Price Drop Rich ResultApproximate Rich ResultDelivery Pricing Rich ResultReturns Policy Rich ResultSummary about the new rich result typesE-commerce websites are huge. If you have ever worked on one, you know that the mindset has changed compared to smaller websites: somehow everything is getting very technical, automation and data analytics are becoming more important, and you can do things at scale, especially using structured data to trigger e-commerce rich results.Every web page on these big sites is struggling to get the appropriate attention and connect with the right audience: your webpage does not mean much if you can not distribute it to the right people and have it in the index in the first place. This is why we care about rich results, because they can actually help you improve your CTR if you know how to trigger them properly.If you are an SEO specialist working in the field of e-commerce SEO, you should know that there have been some Google updates recently that can affect your click-through rate. More specifically, it's about some new e-commerce rich results types that can appear automatically for your pages just because\u2026 Your site qualifies as a candidate in the Google Rich Snippet process.Jokes aside, let us dive in to the process that enables you to win them over. Brodie Clark reviewed the 5 new rich snippets for e-commerce websites on his blog. Price Drop Rich ResultThis concerns the mobile display for e-commerce category pages.Image Source: Review the examples provided by Brodie ClarkPractically, there are two attributes you can give your product category page, and they are:'Average', marked as avg;'Typically', which indicates the normal price at which the products are offered.The attributes \"Average\" and \"Typical\" usually appear when product pages are using the 'Offer' schema markup to automatically add snippet variations. Another thing that can help Google detect these changes on your site is the following:You have multiple 'Offer' schema markups for the same product, but different prices. This is absolutely a schema markup anti pattern, but it's still a good, structured way for them to see a difference for a given product and then average it out;You previously added schema markup, but now you have updated it with a new price. This is a sign to Google that you have made a change in the structured data of your website. Therefore, Google takes the opportunity to present the normal, typical price for your products using the 'typical' attribute;Your products (from your own brand) are displayed on Google with multiple prices (and still use the 'Offer' schema markup ). So Google decides to make the necessary changes to better reflect this and improve the user's search experience.If you decide to use these features, you should not use the price range feature within your schema markup, which is also indicated in their documentation.Approximate Rich Result TypeThese types appear on product listing pages (PDPs) when multiple products are offered on the page. Google uses its computational capabilities to identify the cheapest and the most expensive product. Then, Google uses these numbers to form the approximate price for the products displayed on the PDPs so that it can inform searchers about the approximate price of the products that belong to a particular category.This is even easier for websites that have been online for some time (several years) and use the appropriate schema markup to define their exact price. This works like a charm. See the image below.Image Source: Review the examples provided by Brodie ClarkDelivery Pricing Rich ResultWe have already written about the power of Google Merchant Center and how Google is using this invention to collect more data easily and at scale. Now guess what? Now it's easy for Google to show the prices for delivery in the search results, as they can get this information from the Merchant Center. You can also be eligible for this rich snippet type if you use the shipping delivery time schema markup or any other approved schema markup that relates to the delivery process as a whole.Returns Policy Rich ResultThis feature is also related to Google Merchant Center and, according to our own tests, is mainly displayed on category pages. We expect this to become more common in the future once the merchant's return policy is fully adopted by Schema.org, so more people can use it to describe their return policies on their product and category pages.Summary About The New Rich Result TypesIf you are an e-commerce merchant looking to maximize your SERP space, it might be worth checking out these structured data types. In any case, you should keep in mind that all of these features are still in the experimental phase. However, you should definitely try to enable them on your e-commerce pages and watch out for new developments on this topic.We are here to follow these developments with you and help you gain more organic online traffic to increase your organic sales.

        "text": "SEO Schema Markup Solutions: How To Solve Crawl Budget, Duplication, Intent Disambiguation Table of contents: How to use schema markup for crawl budget optimizationHow to do content and intent disambiguation with schema markupAudience schema markupLanguage schema markupService schema markupTechArticle schema markupWrapping It UpSchema advanced because Google, Yandex, Yahoo and Microsoft wanted it to advance. They agreed on a defined standard to describe web pages as accurately as possible so that search robots can get some help disambiguating web pages on a large scale. We have seen people talk about using schema for conversion optimization - as long as it generates rich results in Google search results pages, businesses can gain some tangible \"SERP real estate\" and encourage searchers to click to their business page online.We have also seen people use schemas to structure their data more coherently and re-use it further to improve conversational AI systems such as chatbots, AI apps, and various smart dashboards for analytics purposes. But have you read that there are SEO schema markup solutions that help with crawl budget, deduplication, and disambiguation of intent? No? Then you have come to the right place!How To Use Schema Markup For Crawl Budget OptimizationDo you have an e-commerce site that hosts thousands or millions of URLs? Many products to manage? Then you will struggle with crawl budget and indexing budget optimization. You can try to control your crawls by smart internal linking, deindexing pages or disallowing certain pages in your robots.txt, but if your pages have a strong backlink profile, Google might decide to ignore your hints and display those pages like any other normal page for online searchers.One way to optimize your crawl and indexing budget is to mark products that are no longer in stock (OOO) and products that are no longer manufactured. There are two SEO schema markup solutions for this: https://schema.org/OutOfStock and https://schema.org/Discontinued. The first one is for products that are no longer in stock, and the second one is for products that are gone forever (discontinued products).Personally, I have always wanted to use other ways to control my crawl budget when it comes to product management on an e-commerce site, but in practice I have learned that sometimes there's too much politics and bureaucracy involved. You have to fight for resources from IT, create detailed financial plans for your projects so management can green light or not, explain the technicalities of using 410 for products that are being phased out\u2026 too many complications. Sometimes it really pays to start small, in this case with schema markup, to properly label all your products, whether they are out of stock, discontinued or in stock - that's the trio that makes your first steps possible.To sum up, instead of using:410 status codesPerform complex backlink analysisRemove URLs from sitemapsBlock resources in robots.txtDeindex webpagesYou can easily start by marking up discontinued and out of stock products and let Google figure out which pages are important. The less important pages, in terms of their total value according to the previous list that are marked with the discontinued item availability status will eventually drop off the index over time. Start smart.How To Do Content And Intent Disambiguation With Schema Markup?Do you have a blog that targets the same keyword but has multiple web pages? Or do you have a large website that suffers from duplicate content? The truth is that duplicate or near-duplicate websites can rank as long as they serve a different user intent or audience. Some SEO schema markup solutions that can help with this are Audience Schema (BusinessAudience and PeopleAudience), Language Schema Markup, Service and TechArticle for example. Here is how:Audience Schema MarkupThis schema markup is typically used when you want to indicate the audience of your content. For example, in some cases you may want to develop content for a higher level audience such as Chief Marketing Officers and Chief Technology Officers, while in other cases you may want to target specialists at a lower career level (e.g. SEO managers, digital marketing specialists, etc.). In other cases, you want a slightly more general audience that fits perfectly with the PeopleAudience schema, while in other articles you want to target a slightly more specific, professional audience. This is where the BusinessAudience schema markup comes in.Language Schema MarkupStruggle with hreflangs and disambiguating content between language similar countries like:German for Austria, Switzerland and Germany?English in Australia, United Kingdom, Canada or the U.S.?Spanish in Spain, Argentina and others?The list goes on.This is where the language schema markup comes to the rescue. If you combine all the important language scheme markup attributes such as areaServed, availableLanguage, and alternateName (with the correct language code), you can signal to search engines which content should appear in which places. Again, we learned from practice that implementing hreflang might be more difficult than expected, so we proceeded with language schema markup instead.Service Schema MarkupDo you offer products and services or only services? Then make sure you markup your pages properly!The service schema markup is kind of an extension of the Language Schema markup, but has other interesting attributes that you can use to further clarify your content, such as availableChannel, isSimilarTo (other service), serviceType, description and alternateName in particular. All of these attributes can help you design your content around similar services or simply differentiate between them when more than 1 service is offered that is similar to each other.TechArticle Schema MarkupIn our Wordlift blog, there are different types of blog posts: some are more general, some are topic-specific, and some are about the latest technological advances, including scripts or experiments that we regularly run at Wordlift. Although all of these articles are eligible for BlogPosting, we may use the TechArticle scheme so that search engines like Google understand that some articles are much more technical than others. If you find yourself in the same situation, it's time to play with this schemeWe can also use the schema:about and schema:description attributes to distinguish between similar articles, because in practice more complex concepts require multiple angles to describe them (i.e. multiple blog posts), and doing that in a single blogspot is not the best solution for you in certain cases.Wrapping It UpWe want to clarify that if you use the right type of schema markup, you can see results in terms of traffic, but also conversions and sales. Designing your content to be understandable and usable is not a trivial task, neither for you as a website owner nor for the search engine bots that have to process it.\u200bWordLift makes it possible to add and use these specific types of schema markup without adding code or going crazy. You and your team do not have to go through a difficult implementation period alone, especially given the fact that more complicated schema markups have yet to be created, as more complex, industry-specific examples are not shown in the schema markup tabs at Schema.org.[et_pb_section global_module=\"20980\"][/et_pb_section]Other Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat is the use of schema markup in SEO?SEO schema markup solutions are used to structure your content on your website, but are also helpful in managing language, audience and crawls.How do I find schema markup?The official site for schema markup is Schema.org, where you can find available markups in the schema's tab. However, we make sure to cover interesting questions about them in our blog that are not answered in online forums or on the Schema.org website itself.What are the types of schema and how many types of markup are there?There are many types of SEO schema markup solutions, probably over 100+ on schema.org but some common include the LocalBusiness, Person, Product, Offer, Organization, BreadcrumbList, OpeningHours and so on.[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

WordLift is happy to announce a member of the team \u2013 Silvia Fratini \ud83d\udc99Quick FactsName: SilviaAge: 34Position in WordLift: Partnership ManagerLanguages spoken: Italian, EnglishLet\u2019s Get to Know SilviaTell us more about yourself\u2026I was born and raised in a small village of 800 people near Rome. Few opportunities, lots of nature, and it was too boring for a young lady like me :). At that time I was not so sure if I was in the right place\u2026 there had to be more out there! I was curious and wanted to explore and test myself, and that determination was the beginning of a long journey that has made me the woman I am today. What happened in the middle?Long story short, after graduating with a degree in economics from La Sapienza University of Rome, I knew I had to learn English to fulfill my wild world travel plan, the worst nightmare during my school career. So London was my destination, and so six months passed between English classes, waitressing shifts, and a few parties! With the arrival of winter, it was time to get back to studying, so I decided to return to Rome and get my Master's degree in International Cooperation. This led me to India, where I wrote my thesis on women's empowerment. I was catapulted into another world full of colors, amazing food, and many religious holidays. After graduation, I had a dream to finally go to Africa! I arrived in the land of Victoria Falls, Zambia, where I worked as a marketing manager on a development project for a year. A super rich experience that consisted of professional successes and exploring the local culture, but also 8 hours a day without electricity, 1 GB of internet per month and Christmas with 40 degrees.After five years on tour, including a semester in the U.S., I was ready to return home with a backpack full of experiences! And a new phase of my life began: more stability and focus on my professional career and relationships. I started working for a publishing group in Rome and stayed for five years. But then came the moment when I wanted to leave my comfort zone (again), and that's when I landed at WordLift. From a big company to a startup, a big leap, right? Yes, and I will do it a hundred more times! In my free time I like to spend evenings playing board games with friends, walking in nature, playing my ukulele, discovering new TV series and cooking healthy food.Three things you love the most about being a Wordlifter\ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\u200d\u2640\ufe0fAmong many other things, what I love most about being a WordLifter is this1. I get to express myself: I have the space to experiment and be creative. But I also take responsibility for the decisions I make2. Thinking big: I need to think outside the box and constantly move beyond my comfort zone. How nice and encouraging it is to say to myself at the end of the day, \" I did it again, and I am happy!3. I feel a strong sense of belonging: I learn new things every day. I work in an international environment that brings me into contact with people from all over the world. I feel that I am making a tangible contribution to the growth of the company.Can you share the exciting, innovative work that you\u2019re doing at WordLift?Being a Partnership Manager at WordLift means discovering partners, interacting with them, maintaining relationships with them, and coordinating their activities with the WordLift team. I learned right away that the types of interactions are always different. When working with people, there is no protocol. Just like in real life, every relationship needs to be nurtured, there should be an actual exchange, and I strongly believe that you need to be authentic in your interactions. For me, the innovative way that I have found key to my role is to build a genuine relationship with each partner and to always encourage communication. I strongly believe in the innovative value of WordLift. The trigger may not be with everyone, of course. Nevertheless, we often find how much the product can be a complement and not a substitute for the partner's service.At the end of the day, the main goal is to be stronger together, to work and create the basis for a long-lasting love relationship\ud83d\ude0d.

        "text": "How To SEO-urvive In Times Of Crisis Every one of us has heard the word crisis a million times a day in the past couple of years. But where does this term come from, and what does it mean?The word crisis comes from the ancient greek: krine in (decide), krisis (decision), and it meant to make a decision. In late Middle English, the term crisis was primarily used in the medical field to express the act of making a decision during the \"decisive point\" of a disease when it could have made a real difference for the patient, and that would have decree life or death.So it's true that in times of crisis you should be prepared and act on your business, especially when it comes to digital marketing. In times of cutbacks, you might think to tighten the knot in digital communications, but that could not be more wrong. Below we explain why NOT you should cut SEO, among the various activities in your digital marketing mix.Stay VisibleSearch engines are not affected by economic downturns. Therefore, especially in times of recessions and crises, it is important to maintain visibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;Investing time and resources in SEO now will create an advantage for your website that will prove successful in the long term: once search engines start to like your content, you'll be ready to creep up and get noticed today and tomorrow.You can leverage simple tasks to optimize your website:Content Optimization: run an organic traffic analysis on your website to check on your pillar themes and see which pages rank for your audience's queries. Make sure you're correctly interpreting today's audience needs and implement a content revamp strategy on the content of your website.Performance Optimization: analyze the performance of your website and fix every issue preventing your website from being super fast and reliable. Resolving technical issues will prepare your website for when things will return to normal.Online Reputation Optimization: make sure everything you're adding or revamping to your website is coherent with your business. Create your business's digital identity by curating all the channels you're acting on: paid search, social media, Google Business Profile\u2026Ensure your message is perfectly understandable by your audience.Feed Your NicheIn times of uncertainty, people tend to disbelieve, with so many ads and promotions going on\u2026But people will always turn to search engines for answers, despite any crisis.Your SEO strategy helps you stay consistent, as you want to appeal to the right users and be endorsed by your specific niche.&nbsp;It's essential to analyze what your niche is searching for, intercept and answer to the user intents (like long tail keywords or People Also Ask) that are specific about your business, and hand out the most meaningful and context-rich information. We want to avoid drowning users in a sea of messages, but providing the direct answer to their questions will loyalize your audience.Search Engines are not influenced by crisis, so the big G will always endorse good, relevant content for each search.&nbsp;Embrace ChangeDuring economic downturns and recessions, it's essential to adapt and be flexible. And so does your content!SEO is flexible to your digital marketing needs and time contingencies. You might perform different SEO tasks at various stages; each will empower your brand online differently.The best way to tackle change in your editorial strategy is to ensure your content adapts to your users' new needs. Make sure to periodically check on the freshness and accuracy of your content by optimizing existing content and pulling content revamp activities on specific pages and articles that are the most important for your business.Start by analyzing the SERP for your strategic keywords.Perform an organic traffic analysis to assess what your users are searching for, then check whether or not you are answering their specific questions on your website.Check if your competitors are responding to these questions and how.Realize an editorial calendar for your content revamp strategy and periodically update your content.In this way, you'll keep your content fresh and attractive to new users willing to know more about your brand and solutions.Take time to rewrite, and revise your pillar content to become more attractive to users and increase your rankings while preparing yourself for the new normal.Be AuthenticSEO results take time, no change will happen overnight, and you need to use different activities to make everything work, as we have seen.That's why building your online authenticity and topical authority is crucial. Stay true to your brand and your users by providing contextual and complete information and good content. You can start working on your E-A-T (Expertise - Authority-Trustworthiness) to attract the attention of search engines.The time you invest in your SEO strategy will pay off. Gaining the trust of the search engines will allow you to climb to the top of the SERP, and no other digital marketing strategy can secure your website the same relevance as when Big G decides your place is on the first page of results.Save MoneySEO guarantees a more significant ROI in the long run compared to Paid search campaigns, not to mention a lower lead acquisition price.If you have to cut back on your digital marketing strategy, remember that investing in SEO does not mean spending money to appear to random people who may not be interested in what you have to offer. On the contrary, you are working to get noticed by users who are already searching for your products or services. It's free traffic, and you do not pay for any additional services to get on the first results page.SEO is a strategic source of organic traffic from users who need your products. Content is king. Optimizing content for your user will lead to higher engagement and conversions, especially compared to your competitors, who need to invest in SEO.Dance With The RobotsSEO can benefit from Artificial Intelligence. If you are a mid to big-sized business running an extensive website, you can leverage AI to scale your SEO strategy and achieve your business goals faster.You can use different AI tools to:Analyze dataGenerate and optimize contentBuild a better user experienceTailor content around your audienceUnderstand the future of search and learn how you can build a successful Conversational AI by incorporating SEO from the start, read our article.ConclusionSEO activities can be absolute lifesavers for your business.SEO has a longer-term impact on your website and provides a positive effect on your technical performance and content.Make sure you stay visible as you prepare for the \"new normal\".[et_pb_section global_module=\"20972\"][/et_pb_section]Here is the presentation of Beatrice Gamba at the event \"SEO e INNOVAZIONE\" in Rome, where she explained why it is important to invest in SEO during an economic downturn.

        "text": "10 Best SEO Add-ons for Google Sheets Google Sheets is one of the favorite tools for those who do SEO due to the possibility of extending the essential functions of the spreadsheet with numerous advanced features useful for SEO tasks. Google Sheets offers the opportunity of developing applications with Apps Script, a cloud-based JavaScript platform, and a no-code alternative based on the numerous add-ons available in the Google Workspace Marketplace library. In this article, I am going to show you the 10 best SEO add-ons for Google Sheets to use to make your work easier.&nbsp;Search Analytics for SheetsGoogle AnalyticsSupermetricsAPI ConnectorSEO Add-on for Google Sheets\u2122 by WordLiftText Analysis by Monkey learnKeyword Research (By Digital Mozarts)Keywords in SheetsRankTankSEOmonitorWhy Use An Add-On For SEO Tasks?With the add-ons, you can perform various activities without necessarily having to go through a code, for example: analyze and compare data, create custom dashboards, track the positioning of a group of keywords, carry out SEO checks or call an API to retrieve data. All of these SEO actions can be automated and scheduled. It is also possible to set up email alerts based on specific values in the spreadsheet fields and continuously be updated when a keyword drops or an SEO task is done.In this guide, we have collected the ten best SEO add-ons trying to sort out the dozens of resources available. But before starting, let's start from the basics and see the options for installing an add-on to Google Sheets.How To Install Add-ons For Google SheetsWe can install an add-on to Google Sheets in two ways:1. Through Google Workspace Marketplace by searching for compatible add-ons and installing with the blue button.2. Inside Google sheet by opening the menu Extensions.Now that we have learned the basics, let's see which add-ons install to improve our daily SEO tasks.Add-Ons For Organic Data Analysis And APIAnalyzing data in Google Sheets is beneficial for several reasons. For example, we can easily combine different sources into a single data set or use the spreadsheet to calculate custom metrics. We can use Google Sheets to store data as if it were in a database and schedule daily imports to build a complex archive. The benefits are many, and thanks to add-ons, everything becomes more accessible. Search Analytics for SheetsSearch Analytics is one of the best no-code options to query Search Console API and get clicks, impressions, average position and CTR data from Google Search Console. Thanks to this add-on, it is easier to aggregate data dimensions that are not available in the Google Search Console web app. Another advantage is the possibility to get much more rows and data by extending the Google Search Console web app limit (from 1000 rows to a maximum of 50,000 rows).Pros:Back up Search Analytics data daily or monthly for each site or property you have set up in your spreadsheet;Create an unlimited number of backup copies;Create both aggregated backups and filtered backups.Google AnalyticsThe most popular add-on for querying the Google Analytics API, which retrieves all available data. The main advantage of this add-on is the ability to quickly create dashboards with Analytics data and use spreadsheets to derive calculated metrics.Pros:Query data from multiple views and create reports;Create visualizations and embed them in third-party websites;Automate the execution and automatic updating of reports.SupermetricsSupermetrics has the most important data sources for SEO: Google Search Console, Google Trends, Google Analytics, Google Business Profile, SEMrush, Moz, Ahrefs and Optimizely. With just one add-on, you can connect various data sources to Google Sheets. Once the data is stored, it can be processed directly in Google Sheets with filters, personalized views or pivot tables. Supermetrics is also a popular add-on because it lets you schedule data collection, emailing or PDF creation when certain conditions are met.Pros:Get all the metrics and dimensions you need;Create custom reports and dashboards and have them delivered directly to your inbox;Set monthly, weekly, daily or hourly updates and automate marketing reporting;Access an extensive collection of Google Sheets report templates.API ConnectorAPI Connector is another popular add-on for connecting with APIs. It is a simple and intuitive add-on with dozens of preset connections, for example to Google Search Console, Ahrefs, Google Analytics and Majestic SEO. It is possible to configure a custom API connection with almost any API. With API Connector, any connection can be configured in just a few clicks, and data extraction is smooth and fast.Pros:Pre-built API connection that you can use in seconds;Has a free plan with a reasonable number of requests.Add-ons For Semantic SEOWe often use Google Sheets to manually analyze keywords or texts of a website. Thanks to semantic SEO add-ons, it is possible to automate some of these processes to get information faster and more efficiently, for example by generating structured data from a page's ranking keywords or analyzing the search intent of a set of keywords to develop an SEO strategy. Let us see what are the best add-ons for semantic SEO.SEO Add-on for Google Sheets\u2122 by WordLiftIf you are interested in semantic SEO markup optimization, then this SEO Add-on is just what you need. The add-on allows you to generate structured data based on the terms contained in the spreadsheet. With the SEO Add-on for Google Sheets by WordLift, you can retrieve up to 1000 queries per time from the Google Search Console API. This may not seem very easy at first glance, but thanks to the step-by-step guide developed by WordLift, the process is easier than you might think. Let us see how it works.Step 0 - Open Google Sheets and install WordLift as described at the beginning of this article. After installation, a new \"WordLift\" menu item will appear in the Extensions section. Click Open to start the wizard.Step 1 - Let's begin the guided procedure and configure the personal key, country, language and Google version. In our example, we select Italy as the country, the language IT (Italian) and the Italian version of google.it. Then click Next.Step 2 - Now select the property in Google Search Console whose queries you want to analyze. Then click Next.Step 3 - Now that we have selected the GSC property, we need to select the reference period; the possible options are 30 days or 90 days. I recommend choosing 30 days if we want to analyze the situation of the most recent keywords, 90 days if we want to study a broader range and also take into account keywords that could show fluctuations, such as no longer being present on the first page. I recommend not enabling the Ignore URLs option, as it can be very handy if the URLs match the search queries. Then click Next.Step 4 - We have a dataset of the top 1000 searches, ordered by clicks. WordLift automatically adds the Select, Query, URL, Clicks, Impressions, CTR and Position columns. Select is a column with a checkbox that allows us to select which queries we want to analyze structured data for. Below you can see what the newly created sheet looks like. Once one or more queries are checked, you can magically create structured data by clicking the Next button.Tip: You can add queries manually if you are interested in queries other than those proposed by Google Search Console.Step 5 - The magic happens! We extrapolated the entities from the queries to get the ID on DBpedia, the entity type, and the Same As attribute. Depending on the number of queries selected, many results may come out. In this case, we recommend that you order the Confidence Sheet to immediately see the generated entities where WordLift has more confidence that they are correct and relevant.Step 6 - Now, we can generate the structured data of the entities and copy-paste them within our site.Pros:Unique features available;Can scale the development of structured data on a website;Easy to use even for non-technical SEOs thanks to step-by-step instructions;Live help desk with short response time.Text Analysis by Monkey learnText Analysis by Monkey Learn is a practical tool for analyzing texts from a semantic point of view.

        "text": "Top SEO Trends for 2023 2023 is the year of the Generative Web (or Text-to-X if you like). The most significant shift in how we create, find, and consume content online. AI-generated content will be indistinguishable from human-generated content and has demonstrated in 2022 the potential to revolutionise journalism, SEO, and content marketing.\u201cI don't know what's going on. I don't understand anything except the rules for symbol manipulation. Now in this case I want to say that the robot has no intentional states at all; it is simply moving about as a result of its electrical wiring and its program. And furthermore, by instantiating the program I have no intentional states of the relevant type. All I do is follow formal instructions about manipulating formal symbols.\u201dJohn R. Searle - (1980) Minds, brains, and programs.We founded WordLift with the belief that websites would eventually be transformed into datasets, and that AI would assist us in navigating the vast global information ecosystem. Our goal is to continue making data accessible and easy to use for everyone, while empowering successful AI projects.SEO has changed forever as queries that would traditionally go to Google, are being intercepted by ChatGPT. This is happening at the speed of 1 million prompts per day.\u201cLLMO, or large language model optimization, is a term we coined to refer to ensuring your business information is mentioned within a large language model (LLM). One effective technique for this is in-context learning.\u201dHan Xiao and Alex C-G - Jina AIMore than ever, optimization techniques to increase demand for products and services are critical for businesses. SEO continues to evolve to accommodate the changing nature of search and the increasing use of conversational AI. In our industry, we have long optimized for AI-specific ranking factors, such as a website's ability to provide a clear and coherent response to a given search query, or the use of structured data to make it easier for Google to understand and interpret a website's content, or even how to get into Google's Knowledge Graph. That was just the beginning. In 2023, things are changing at an unprecedented pace as generative technology delivers a new result for every new user, a new result for every problem, and at web scale. The game has begun and here are my predictions.In a nutshell:Automation and augmentation remain closely intertwined, and the ability to experiment with new optimization techniques such as in-context learning, instructions-based prompts, and other emerging behaviors of foundational models remains anchored to an extensible data fabric and brand authority.We build Knowledge Graphs to structure data, making it more flexible and easier for brands to interact with Generative Tech.WORKING RESPONSIBLY WITH AI SYSTEMS IS NOT AN OPTION: IT IS AN IMPERATIVE.Gary Marcus at EMNLP 2022 reminding us how LLMs are prone to factually incorrect information (a.k.a. \u201cfluent bullshit\u201d) - IF WE DO AI WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT ETHICSAs in previous years, I'd like to thank the amazing colleagues I work with, as well as our great clients and investors. These annual SEO trends are not only my predictions, but also the trends WordLift will focus on to ensure the success of our clients and the continued development of our platform.What Are The Top Trends For SEO In 2023?Here are the top 5 trends you need to watch in 2023:Generative ContentE-E-A-T and Structured DataMultimodal eCommerceIntent is kingRecession mode: game onGenerative ContentGenerative technology has made great strides in 2022. Advances in deep learning and natural language processing have led to the development of sophisticated AI systems that we can use for a variety of SEO tasks.The current state-of-the-art in many deep learning domains typically relies on three key components:Large, scalable architectures (such as those based on the Transformer)Head-based transfer learning where a generic head layer takes pretrained representations to predict an output classPrompting where a task-specific pattern string is designed to coax the model into producing a textual output corresponding to a given class.These models can be applied to a variety of data types, including images, videos, and audio. In the area of AI-powered SEO, some of the most successful models we have used include BERT, RoBERTa, BART, DistillBERT, T5, and GPT-3 trained on billions of tokens of English text using masked language modeling techniques.I expect a strong acceleration in incorporating external knowledge into learning by improving the prompt. We have tested several ways to expand words into prompts from a knowledge base (i.e., a taxonomy). Significant progress has been made on the research front by Liu et al. using an LM to generate relevant knowledge statements in a \"few-shot\" setting. Also worth mentioning is the work on incorporating additional knowledge data by enriching the training data with entity descriptions and entity types (see Arora et al.) or improving contextual learning performance by providing better explanations in the prompts, as proposed by Xi Ye et al.. In layman's terms, working with curated external data will help LLMs get smarter without sacrificing performance.We can also foresee that data is becoming the real bottleneck when training LMs. Jordan Hoffmann and the team at DeepMind introduced a 70B LM called \"Chinchilla\" that outperformed bigger LMs (GPT-3, Gopher) by scaling training data and not exclusively parameters. If adding more data helps improve the performances, we can understand why OpenAI is developing speech recognition systems like \"Whisper\" that can feed the otherwise severely starved and under-trained LMs with trillions of text tokens from YouTube or any Podcast available. More than general-domain data is needed; this will also apply to fine-tuning our custom models; I expect we will source more information from existing multimedia content.\u00a0\u00a0Under the pressure of more and more users switching to ChatGPT for various queries, Google will soon introduce its conversational AI machinery. I expect that Google will try to use both the web index and E-E-A-T signals.By experimenting in 2022 with LLMs in SEOs, we have learned a few lessons that are shaping our way forward:We need to focus on fact-oriented information to bring value to the end user. Only by improving factual accuracy (Truthful AI), we can future-proof AI-generated content as Google improves its spam detection algorithms. The highest cost lies in building validation pipelines that can provide any brand with accurate information and the proper writing style and tone of voice.Fine-tuning and in-context learning are powerful approaches that can be made available to content creators and SEOs with effective feedback loops. When we adequately engaged the content team, we saved time and significantly improved quality.Prompt improvements can be obtained by comparing the visual similarity of synthetic images produced using text-to-image and CLIP. This is also an exciting line of research to follow in the coming months (see the visual entitlement work by Song et al.)Prompt improvement and verification by combining GPT-3 with DALL\u00b7E 2We are not Jasper (or any other off-the-shelf content generation tool that supports content writing); we are an SEO automation platform leveraging semantic data: to make an impact, we must wear our SEO hat first.The Generative Web is changing the way content is delivered to the end user; content exists in its unique form once it reaches the target audience. However, the need to organize content using entities remains. For example, look at the chain presented in the following thread and the limitations of AI systems that do not use knowledge graphs.https://twitter.com/cyberandy/status/1602646415632637954?s=20&amp;t=tkVZXiUSm6xFuW8zCP_5qgWe can see the same issue using the newly introduced chatbot (YouChat) on You.com. It is terrific and plausible, but unable to understand what it is talking about.YouChat by You.comIn-Context Learning ExplainedHere is an example of how injecting factual information in the prompt helps fine-tuning the result.Who is Lily Ray?Who is Lily Ray the SEO expert that lives in New York and is also a deejay?You are a truthful AI, and you only provide factually correct information. Who is Lily Ray, the New York SEO expert who works as a deejay?You are a truthful AI, and you only provide factually correct information. Who is Lily Ray, the New York SEO expert who works as a deejay? Explain the reasoning behind each sentence step by step and provide the sources. Do not mention she is a software engineer or she has a GitHub account.This is Lily Ray\u2019s experiment (see here) that helps us understand the limitations of LMs.Takeaway:Ask yourself what data can make your prompts unique. In-context learning requires a clear understanding of entities; we need facts (triples) to add more context as we prompt the model. The generative web starts here.Focus on strengthening the validation pipeline for content; make sure the tone of voice always matches the brand.Be responsible in your use of AI and find the best feedback loop by partnering with domain experts and content creators.E-E-A-T and Structured DataGoogle's assessment of content quality will become stricter as more and more synthetic content is created. LLMs will also be affected; their quality is at risk as they will be fed their own content from now on. Brand equity will become more important in 2023. Performance marketing, social media networks, and online advertising will become less and less important (TikTok may even be banned soon in the US). As AI content becomes more prevalent, the search experience will become cluttered, and only strong brands will succeed and take full advantage of generative technology. Looking at the structured data types in your industry and developing a solid plan will strengthen your brand. We have seen the importance (for eCommerce sites) of sophisticated Product and Review markup. It's best to have a flawless implementation of structured data that guides the crawler and establishes the authority of the brand and its ambassadors (editors, content writers, and domain experts). The strength of a brand also depends on its ability to publish linked data at scale. Structured and linked data, the use of identifiers, and the use of other data sources and websites that cite products, places, events, and people are no longer a niche experiment but are becoming a profitable strategy for many brands.Takeaway: Focus on your authority by connecting your data with other data. Design a flawless structured data strategy and follow Google\u2019s quality guidelines for content. They will be a lifesaver as you will embrace AI Content. Set up your off-site Structured Linked Data plan; it\u2019s link-building on steroids.Multimodal eCommerceSEO for eCommerce has evolved significantly in 2022, and Google has placed more emphasis on user experience and quality content to gain ground over Amazon. In addition, the use of artificial intelligence in its algorithms (such as the product review algorithm) and the introduction of product knowledge graph panels require retailers to constantly adapt their strategies to evolving trends. Even before the opening of ChatGPT and the \"Code Red\" that Google is issuing in response to OpenAI and Microsoft, e-commerce search queries had become more conversational and multimodal.This has led to concrete opportunities for brands investing in creating a suitable knowledge base of question-and-answer pairs associated with products and product categories. Our success in automating the generation of FAQ content for eCommerce websites has been significant, with thousands of new snippets that brought double-digit sales growth. Our product here will continue to improve to be brighter at sifting through queries, fact-checking answers, and interacting with editors and SEOs.Generating product photography using Midjourney.With Google Lens receiving more than 8 billion queries per month, developing robust product visuals for the different SKUs is also becoming an imperative. MUM is naturally anticipating the next step on the searcher journey and images are, for most products, a key element.Here we can see the uptake of 35.6% on the clicks on the variant group with the enhanced markup where we improved both quality and quantity of the images associated with the Product Markup.We also must consider the interplay between Google Lens and local search, as users can now search images and text combined to find products from local retailers. It\u2019s an excellent opportunity to show the importance of a solid structured data strategy emphasising data linking.A new opportunity is made available with Google\u2019s multisearch \u201cnear me\u201d queries.As we convert products into entities for the product knowledge graph, I can also see the value of improving the semantic annotations for images and bringing full support for 3D models recently introduced in Google search for sneakers and other product types.Annotating images will be an important optimization task.The drivers behind Multimodal eCommerce are also represented by the evolution of smart glasses and AR/VR experiences that are slowly entering the market.\u00a0Takeaway: Invest in AI workflows to develop comprehensive product images, improve image resolution when needed, experiment with text-to-image and image-to-image foundational models to build the proper context for your products, and work on image annotations. A robust strategy for image annotation will allow your organisation to gain additional visibility on search and help you fine-tune contrastive models like CLIP for visual inference.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Intent Is King\u00a0Basic model-based recommendation systems accelerate content discovery by offering users personalized content based on their search history and interests. I expect to see an increase in queryless traffic, as users will have to type in fewer specific keywords or phrases to find relevant content. Instead, recommendations will be generated by predicting user intent. As in years past, Google Discover traffic will provide a valuable stream of clicks because it comes from users who are actively interested in the recommended content. Intent detection with LLMs will enable a new wave of recommendation tools alongside Google Discover and Microsoft Start. The ability to interact more directly with search engines like You.com will allow publishers and brands to shape the user experience when their core content is searched for.The ability to augment search results and recommendations inside You.com is exciting: \u201cBuild Your Own Panel\u201d!Takeaway: Develop new traffic streams, optimize for Google Discover, and look for emerging platforms to expose content and products in new and innovative ways. Building apps inside Social Networks, Search Engines, or Chatbot platforms will be an important trend to follow.Recession Mode: Game OnAfter a sustained period of slow economic growth, the end of the pandemic, and the war in Ukraine, we are facing a global recession with high unemployment, low consumer confidence, and declining business investment. The economic hardship and the decline in investment in risky assets have also led to the cryptocurrency crisis. These are difficult times, but I am confident that the digital economy in general will show some resilience. As they cut advertising spending, more companies will also turn to organic growth. In the SEO space (or the new LLMO arena where we optimize data for GPT-4 and the like), we need to focus on two things: 1) doing more with less through automation and 2) investing in solid reporting. Digital marketing needs to prove its value to the bottom line, and we can leverage AI for better SEO predictions, causal impact analysis, and A/B testing. If we can not deliver at least a 3x increase in value (for every dollar spent, our approach or technology brings in at least $3 in revenue), we are not the right partner. To be successful, you must constantly introduce new ideas and strategies. If you do not innovate, you are much more likely to become irrelevant. 2023 is the year of the productivity boost. We can quickly solve problems that slow us down with just a few lines of code, a small prompt, or no code at all. It's a dream come true, and it's enabling a new wave of small tools that will change the way we work forever.Takeaway: Improve your reporting skills and tooling, look extensively at the business impact that SEO and digital marketing creates. As less investment can be made, remain lean and embrace open innovation. Companies will need a stream of innovation. Be ready to incorporate ideas, technologies, and knowledge from outside your organization.Are you ready to innovate on SEO in 2023? Still have a question?

        "text": "Top 5 SEO Trends 2022 that you should know! The year 2021 left most of us disoriented and speechless. Yet, I believe we all realized how important it is to stay connected and build an open and democratic society that can tackle misinformation and disinformation. 2022 will be a year of data empowerment. Now, more than ever, everyone can use artificial intelligence and create a significant impact on both business and society. Yet, this is only possible when organizations own and manage meaningful and well-formed semantic data.\u201cThere is a wealth of content that we produce, refine, consume, transmit, and inherit as humans. They include ideas, insights, discoveries, inventions, traditions, cultures, languages, arts, religions, sciences, narratives, customs and norms.\u201d\u201c(SC) Semantic Capital\u2009=\u2009def. any content that can enhance someone\u2019s power to give meaning to and make sense of (semanticise) something.\u201dLuciano FloridiWhen we started WordLift, we believed that web pages would become datasets and intelligent agents would help us navigate a global information ecosystem. Now more than ever making data simple for everyone is becoming crucial for every successful AI project.&nbsp;Here are my SEO predictions for 2022.In a nutshell:&nbsp;Robots have taken more considerable responsibility for content creation and personalization, and it is becoming essential to redefine the human-machine interplay. How algorithms are introduced in the organization's social fabric and how transparent and explainable these algorithms have marked the difference. Particularly in SEO, where creating great content is critical, the concepts of automation and augmentation are intertwined. As for the previous years, this is also the time for me to thank all of the fantastic people I work with and the tremendous clients we have. These yearly SEO trends are not just what I think will happen but are also the trends we will be betting on for our client's success and the evolution of our technology.This blog post is also available as Web Story \ud83d\udc49  \"Top SEO Trends 2022\"What are the top trends for SEO in 2022?The trends for SEO in 2022 are related to creating scalable human-machine publishing workflows. Here are the top 5 trends you need to watch in 2022:Multimodality and Multilinguality: From a Web Index to Pre-Trained ModelsOptimised On-site SearchPhygital and Local SEOConversational User InterfacesClimate-neutral websitesMultimodality and Multilinguality: From a Web Index to Pre-Trained ModelsOne of the key challenges at the intersection of computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP) is building versatile vision-language models that work in English and all of the world's approximately 7,000 languages. MUM is a breakthrough in this context, and every SEO should think more and more about the interconnectedness of various media, entity-based content modeling, and data interoperability.&nbsp;The recent developments on neural extractive search (extracting fact-oriented information) and a new generation of transformer-based models like Retrieval-Enhanced Transformer (RETRO) by DeepMind or WebGPT by OpenAI are all going in the same direction of MUM: improving factual accuracy - the so-called - truthful AI. Now, all of this means increasing the relevancy of authoritative sources. Wikidata plays a vital role as well as other notable linked data resources. The same applies, of course, to other relevant websites.We could see this already happening with the arrival of KELM, LaMDA, and of course MUM itself. Wikidata and other multilingual knowledge graphs become essentials as search engines provide more discovering capabilities (think, how the topic zooming works in MUM and what data is needed to train this ability to move back and forth across multiple topics). In 2021, before MUM was announced, an academic paper by Google introduced the idea of replacing the index-retrieve-then-rank Search (that we all know) with a Pre-Trained Language model.&nbsp;&nbsp;High-level schematics of the traditional index-retrieve-then-rank (left) and model-based (right) paradigms.This will be a significant shift in SEO, and the winners will be the ones able to create authoritative, factual, and helpful content. It is not futuristic as it sounds. MUM is already impacting the search experience.&nbsp;What does it mean to do SEO when the search engine becomes a web-scale trained language model?Let me show you an example. Here is a dialog I had using BlenderBot2, an open-source chatbot (developed by Facebook) that builds long-term memory and searches the open web. Immediately gives you the idea of how important it is to focus on your area of expertise. I find the passage on Jason Barnard truly revealing. It demonstrates what excellent work Jason has been doing in his area of expertise and how he stands up regardless of the communication medium.Takeaway: focus on creating unique, fact-based content that expresses your area of expertise at best. Remember that factual accuracy is based on the corroboration of information across multiple sources. Publishing your graph, investing in your brand SERP and interlinking data with Wikidata greatly help this process.Learn more about&nbsp;Multimodal Search&nbsp;by watching our Web Stories.Optimised On-site SearchThere are no shortcuts in 2022: your content to rank will need to be fantastic and very well organized. This will require, also considering the MUM update, that content is unique, marked up with relevant entities, and classified into topical hubs. When doing that, you will quickly realize that, as more quality content is written and added to the website:the information architecture expressed in navigation menus is no longer enough to help users find what they are looking for;clustering content that is semantically relevant, is greatly helping your SEO strategy but quickly becomes overwhelming for the editorial team when done manually;\u200b\u200byou need your first-party data to quickly analyze and dissect the user\u2019s intents and iterate on the information architecture. Reading and analysing data from your Google Search Console helps but it\u2019s like evaluating the interiors of a car while watching it from the outside. You need to open the door and look from the inside to appreciate all the details.These are the main drivers for optimizing the on-site search experience that will be an essential aspect of your SEO strategy. In SEO, we constantly work to expose the content on every Google property: top news carousels, local packs, rich snippets but also Google Maps, Google News, Google Lens, and Google Discover. Imagine looking at on-site search as yet one more channel to optimize for.Here is a simple diagram presenting how structured data (and your Knowledge Graph) can improve search rankings on Google and boost the relevance for the results on the internal search engine.&nbsp;What metrics do we track for a successful on-site search experience?&nbsp;On the business side, we\u2019ll be looking primarily at conversion rate (especially for e-commerce websites), brand loyalty (the percentage of users returning to the website), and session duration. In technical terms we shall be monitoring:Query relevancy and CTR - how critical are these searches for the business? What queries are getting the higher CTR? Are these the same queries that we\u2019re intercepting with these pages on Google? Or there is a mismatch?&nbsp;Searches with no results - what content are we missing? What are people looking for that we currently don\u2019t have?If you are interested in understanding what characteristics your search engine should have, you can watch a session I had with Bo Wang from the Jina AI team (here is the link to the talk). I can see two strategic areas to focus on in this context:1. Implementing neural search to improve relevancyBefore everything else, you want the results to be as relevant as possible and to consider all the content you have to offer for a given intent.&nbsp;Below is an example of the results we can obtain by combining text and image modalities on a client's website using vector-based semantic search. In some cases, it might also help to enable the support for multilinguality. In this specific example, the search query is in Italian \"orologio\" (that means \u201cwatch\u201d in English).&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Let Google index long-tail pages that bring valueWhen the internal search engine can recognize, if the search intent matches an existing web page (a product page or a category page), we can improve the customer journey significantly by sending the users to the best content we have without going through a result page. The internal search will display a search result page for any other intent, where no equivalent page can be found on the site. These pages, in most cases, work well also on organic search and shall be indexed. We can also improve these pages by adding an intro text and semi-automated FAQ, as shown below.Takeaway: make sure Google Analytics (or any other web analytics you use) is configured to capture the wealth of search data from the on-site search and build a plan to optimize it. Your on-site search can become a vital ally to capture long-tail intents you are not covering yet. Prevent the on-site search from rendering a result page when there is already a category or a product page that matches the user request.&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Phygital and Local SEOI expect things to get back to normal in terms of overall e-commerce traffic as the pandemic will begin to wind down. At the same time, the web is becoming more visual, and sites with unique and larger images will continue to see growth in Image, Product, and Universal search.\u00a0Google Lens is also becoming an essential client acquisition channel, especially for e-commerce websites. Improving the quantity and the quality of the images greatly helps with visibility and traffic.Here below is one of the experiments we did, along with the team of Ippen Digital, where we succeeded in bringing one of their sites to the top for a visual query depicting the wall mural in front of their office.Phygital, the fusion of the words physical and digital, it\u2019s a trend that will continue to characterize 2022.Everything from real-world images to QR-codes will facilitate connecting objects in the real world and digital experiences. We have also been experimenting with GS1 Digital Links (here is a blog post on Physical SEO) to see how barcodes can help connect physical products with a linked data ecosystem.&nbsp;In general, the intersection between multimodal search, commerce, and local SEO is something to focus on.Takeaway: integrating Google Business Profile listing with structured data and product feeds will help retailers improve the customer experience. Connecting physical stores with e-commerce experiences by providing \"in stock\" data will also be an essential aspect to consider. Last but not least, investing in high-quality imagery will be needed as visual content will take more space on Google's surfaces.4. Conversational User InterfacesOn one hand, Google\u2019s shift to a more conversational user experience is changing how users interact with information, and on the other hand, the availability of best-in-class language models and mature chatbot frameworks have greatly improved the quality of natural language understanding, and therefore the ability to create valuable chatbots on every website. While still hard to measure, we can see how well long-tail queries are rendered in&nbsp; Featured Snippets, People Also Ask, and the Google Assistant.&nbsp; It's becoming more natural for users to move back and forth between voice search and mobile browsing. This entices us to embed conversational user interfaces (CUI) in the customer journey to make it feel more natural, increase the conversion rate, and/or improve content discovery.\u00a0Combining more traditional web content with human-friendly CUI is already happening. We can see the traction by looking at the download rates of open source frameworks like RASA that are simply tremendous.\u00a0So I can foresee a stronger integration between structured data, knowledge graphs, and chatbots starting from FAQ content that is already working well on Google\u2019s various channels and that can be brought also on-site using vector-based semantic search.&nbsp;Below is an easy-to-use CUI that combines a content cluster around mutual funds with a conversational UI that runs on top of question-answer pairs stored in a knowledge graph. It gives you an idea of the type of experience that can be built by re-using SEO-optimized content.&nbsp;An AI chatbot can re-use the same data to trigger Google\u2019s advanced features.&nbsp;Four years ago when Scott Abel dubbed me as \u201cthe man who makes websites talk\u201d, I have been experimenting a lot since then (here is the original implementation), and now I can see this becoming a major trend.&nbsp;SEO efforts on structured data and content modeling are not for Google's only \ud83d\ude09.Takeaway: Audit the content on your website to cluster areas where CUI can improve your metrics. Remember that having data in a graph is not a must-have in the beginning but quickly becomes necessary to scale the conversations and cover more intents. Re-using content from the website is of great help. Some content like videos, FAQs, and recipes already have a conversation-friendly format, and everything else can be proposed in a conversation as a recommended link.&nbsp;5. Climate-neutral websitesIn November @izzionfire (Isobel Smith who is Technical SEO Team Lead at Ryte) has presented loud and clear the importance of working for greenable and sustainable websites.&nbsp;We all know by now that the clock is ticking and we need to fight climate change at all levels. Right now is worth mentioning two facts:Internet habits, according to the BBC, account already for 3.7% of the global greenhouse gas emissions (tech is far from being a green industry),Reducing emissions will eventually influence search behaviors as we globally realize the importance of saving the Planet.Google is already bringing carbon emission data to flights and hotels. It is not too far-fetched to expect a badge on SERP highlighting greener websites.&nbsp;https://twitter.com/izzionfire/status/1458431010954227714 At WordLift, we already run our cloud infrastructure on Microsoft Azure that, as a part of Microsoft, has been 100 percent carbon neutral since 2012. They do this by offsetting carbon emissions. This is a good starting point, but I plan to do more and contribute to a change in attitude on this front.Takeaway: start thinking about assessing the carbon footprint of your website. After all improving performances will go hand in hand with helping the environment. Moving to a greener cloud infrastructure to reduce unneeded errors on your site every step will be an important one.\u00a0This blog post is also available as Web Story \ud83d\udc49  \"Top SEO Trends 2022\"Are you ready to innovate on SEO in 2022?

It is a new generative language model optimized for chat or in simple terms you can send prompts to their AI Bot (requests in the form of mostly short texts in natural language) and get an answer back (a textual answer to a question, initial article drafts, summarized responses, code in various programming languages, you name it).We already wrote about prompt engineering and generative AI for SEO in some of our past articles but it seems that the world did not get their full power before ChatGPT was introduced to the wider audience. We are proud to share that we have been some of the pioneers in this field and we actively worked on developing SEO friendly workflows for text generation in the last two years with specific implementations for eCommerce and news websites.What we have learned is that large language models like this are trained on a large amount of data and require significant financial investment in the computer, so it is not easy to replicate them. Models like this are capable of performing tasks for which they have not been explicitly trained, such as translating text from one language to another [e.g., from English to German and vice versa] and applying that knowledge to other domains.You can tell that it is worth giving a go if you consider the fact that ChatGPT got 1 million users in the first 5 days of launching, something that took Netflix to achieve in around 3.5 years, Facebook 10 months, Spotify 5 months and Instagram in 2.5 months! Crazy! Some SEO marketers, like Malte Landwehr, even predict that \u201ca lot of typical outsourcing or junior jobs in management consulting, legal, finance, etc. will be replaced by AI over the next 2-10 years. In such roles, companies will fire 90% of the team, keep the top 10%, double their salaries, and 5x their efficiency with AI tools like ChatGPT\". Are you convinced now? Because the hype is there and it will be here to stay!The real power that ChatGPT has in general is that it is able to give direct answers to questions through its simple user interface: we are able to get responses back in a matter of a few milliseconds, instead of the casual search process through pages and links, like we do on search engines like Google. As a consequence, ChatGPT caused \u201ccode red\u201d at Google. Apparently, Google\u2019s CEO Sundar Pichai participated in urgent meetings to further define the AI strategy for Google after the release of ChatGPT. Having in mind that their business model heavily relies on ads and e-commerce features that are the basis of their revenue model, sources reveal that Google finds this concerning.&nbsp;Let us dive in more into details how you can use ChatGPT SEO for your content marketing strategy and as a productivity tool to develop your ideas faster. Fasten your seat and let\u2019s go! \ud83d\ude42Mastering Prompts For AI BotsFirst things first. The first step: SEOs needed and still need to master prompts. That is because prompt quality dramatically affects the quality of the given output. Those who manage to be successful in doing so, putting the effort to learn the basics about how an AI chatbot generally works and embrace new technologies, will become leading voices in the industry and dominate the future. You will need to write clearly, to the point and descriptively enough to explain your prompt request.Two years ago it was really primarily about prompt mastering, however, nowadays LLMs have evolved and we know that a successful SEO shall take into account:the data that will make the prompts unique (this is why you have an extra competitive edge if you have invested on structured linked data);have a content validation pipeline (because LLMs are statistical machines with no real understanding of the content they produce);work to embed the tone of voice of the brand (you need transfer learning, using fine-tuning or in-context learning);be responsible when using AI and most importantly find the best feedback loop by joining forces with domain experts and content creators.A preview of the preview of WordLift Content Generation Tool that is designed tohelp editors review the TOV by promoting / demoting words or lexical expressions.LLMs are helpful and worth the effort but they can be complex as well. One way to judge their \u201ccomplexity\u201d is their size. The number of their trainable parameters per LLM can vary - more parameters mean more training but at the same time more parameters can mean that the model is able to solve more complex problems. Another way to measure the size of the model is to consider the amount of data it has been trained on. Finally, the reason for enormous model sizes, no matter how they are measured, is the application of transformer architectures - they are the main driver behind the latest innovations in the NLP, NLG and NLU field. We even predicted LLMs' advancement 2 years ago: now it is your turn to embrace their full power.Try our AI question answering tool to extract relevant questions from URLs and then automatically answer!How To Overcome The \u201cWriter\u2019s Block\u201dEngineering good prompts is not easy but it can be learned. Here are some example prompts:\u201cWrite me a summary of Harry Potter\u201d\u201cWrite an article on the topic of knowledge graphs\u201d (btw, this article is written by a proper human, no worries)\u201cShowcase your previous answer in bullet points\u201d\u201cExplain the benefits of using ChatGPT in a few sentences\u201dAs you can see, the verb is leading in the beginning, then we have the subject and finally a guideline about how we want to structure the answer.&nbsp;For an ideal prompt engineering, we need to follow the MCSSCF prompt framework:Write proper meta instructions which describe the expected output, e.g. \u201cprovide an answer to X as you were an expert computer scientist\u201d;Provide the right content modifiers, e.g. \u201ca summary of\u2026\u201d;Subject description, e.g. \u201cblack jacket for women from the 80ties\u201d;Styling, e.g. \u201cprovide an answer in the style of Shakespeare\u201d;Context, e.g. provide some text for context and then ask questions about it;Format, e.g. camera details, text styling, resolution output, etc;And so on, you can learn more about how to perfect your prompt engineering here.To summarize, it is absolutely vital to be clear, concise and to the point!If you are having trouble coming up with ideas for your writing, the suggestions above can help you overcome your writer's block. In the first phase, start by writing some prompts to ChatGPT and then refine them. We do not expect the AI bot to answer absolutely perfectly, but it's still much better than many other AI tools out there.ChatGPT SEO Clustering: Grouping Keywords At ScaleTired of paying for SEO tools to cluster your keywords at scale? Not having the right coding skills to do it by yourself or at least the program is not fast enough to do this properly fastly and reliably? Then ChatGPT comes to the rescue! You can give an order to the bot through the prompt \u201cclassify the keywords\u201d and provide the list of keywords on your side and you can expect them to see them clustered based on their semantic closeness. Easy, fast, reliable: say bye bye to complex Excel sheets commands, expensive software or complicated AI tools that require a bit of a learning curve in order to learn how to use them properly! Tobias Willman had a wonderful Python script on the topic that you can analyze and try to adjust to your specific case.Getting Initial SEO Tips When Beginning As A Newbie In The FieldAre you a new SEO trainee who just barely started out in the SEO world? There is nobody that can act as your mentor to point you to the right literature, especially when solving specific problems? No worries, ChatGPT SEO got you covered!&nbsp;Ask \u201cHow to do SEO for an e-commerce website\u201d or instruct the AI chatbot to write a text for you by combining multiple, connected prompts like:\u201cInclude H1, H2, H3 headings in the text\u201d\u201cUse specific entities in the text\u201d\u201cInclude specific keywords through the writing\u201dand voila! You have your first ready content piece that you can feature on your blog. Easy peasy.Extracting Entities, Their Relationships And Constructing The Basis for Knowledge GraphsAre you an SEO professional who does not have any specific experience with the computer science and engineering world but still loves to play with the newest AI technologies whenever you get the chance to do so? Not versatile in the NLP world but already know the basics of entities, entity relationships and the benefits of having a content knowledge graph? You are in the right place! You can instruct ChatGPT to extract entities and entity triples to form a knowledge graph and its appropriate ontology. As Lee Foot showcased on Twitter, we can use the following prompts in order to make this possible:\u201c1. Build a knowledge graph in RDFlib format for\u2026Build ontology in OWLready2 format for\u2026Extract semantic triples in a dataframe with columns, s,p,o (Python code) for the following text\u2026\u201dIn any case, please note that ChatGPT is still unable to create entity links to demonstrate true semantic understanding, and sometimes the bot star can be misleading: it can create markup using schema properties that do not exist, and it is also able to create Wikipedia links to pages that never existed! Crazy, is not it?This is definitely a shortcoming of ChatGPT. Be careful how you use this AI beast - wrong intentions, bad prompts and too high expectations can lead to bad or even harmful results. Be careful!Simplifying Writing Regular Expressions (Regex Natural Language Queries)Have you ever tried to find the right regex expression to detect or remove substrings in your text? We must admit that we are among those who struggle with writing proper SEO regexes and search for the right programming trick on Stackoverflow, just like you. Now you can solve this problem almost completely by telling ChatGPT to do it for you, all in simple, natural language!Here is one regex instruction that Aleksa Gordic, research engineer at DeepMind, posted on Linkedin a while ago:Source: Linkedin, Aleksa Gordi\u0107Train The Bot To Generate Similar Paintings On A Same Topic Like Your Previous Art PiecesBoost your content designers and graphic designers with ChatGPT by training it on your own art pieces from the past. You do not need to go to Shutterstock and other stock image-based websites anymore to buy the right picture for you. You can start making a triple collaboration between you, your designers and ChatGPT and ask the AI Bot to \u201ccreate a picture on the same topic like the one shown before\u201d or \u201ccreate a picture of Googlebot in the style of X\u201d. It is all about prompt engineering.Ok, Then, Will ChatGPT Replace Google?The short answer is NO. Consumer search engines are processing billions of queries that require information extraction from sources that exist only a few hours, days or weeks. At the current moment of speaking, in order to achieve the same result, LLMs will need to have the ability to be retrained at the same speed interval and ChatGPT does not satisfy that criteria. For now.You can justify this fact just by trying to write up some product queries and you will see that responses are mostly, if not all, containing information that it is dating up to 2021 but 2022 data is not included. This affects the freshness of the given responses and of course this compromises their truthfulness.Long story short, we are still lacking exact, in-depth information on how LLMs are trained and how exactly their black box AI magic is working behind the scenes. At the same time, queries provided to search engines are longer and expressed in natural language, not really in a prompt-based fashion and search engines like Google are already winning and dominating that front.SummaryThe future belongs to those who embrace technology. You should not be afraid of it, but rather learn how it works, educate yourself on the topic of prompt engineering or collaborate with your developers to help you out on the way.We need to be absolutely aware of the importance of having a strong data foundation and validation - without solid data foundation and knowledge graph strategy it will be impossible to achieve a highly-performant SEO organic strategy and be prepared for the Generative AI era. Just like Andrea Volpini predicted the SEO trends for 2023:\"Automation and augmentation remain closely intertwined, and the ability to experiment with new optimization techniques such as in-context learning, instructions-based prompts, and other emerging behaviors of foundational models remains anchored to an extensible data fabric and brand authority.\"AI and ChatGPT SEO are here to stay, the question is\u2026.will you be part of the revolution? More Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat is ChatGPT?ChatGPT (or also known as Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chatbot AI product developed and published by OpenAI (a San Francisco company) by the end of 2022. It is built based on the GPT-3.5 family of large language models where computer scientists used both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques to fine-tune this AI model.Is ChatGPT free?ChatGPT was free in 2022 and still is during its research phase, however, it is expected that the tool will be monetized in future.What can ChatGPT be used for?ChatGPT can be used for many tasks and it can be used for a variety of language tasks, such as language translation, summarization, question answering, and text generation. For SEO purposes, some of them include generating content in the form of text, like clustering keywords, generating structured data and robots.txt files, writing code, extracting entities and their respective relationships, creating text summaries, creating social media posts or website content and so on.Can ChatGPT translate language?You can use ChatGPT for translation: simply enter the text that you want to translate into the chatbot and specify the languages that you want to translate between. For example, you might instruct the tool: \"Translate 'Hello, how are you?' from English to German.\" and it will generate the requested translation.It's important to keep in mind that machine translation is not always perfect, and the quality of the translation will depend on the complexity of the text and the languages involved. However, ChatGPT can provide a useful starting point for translation tasks and can be a helpful tool for understanding the general meaning of text in a different language.Is GPT-3 the most advanced AI?This model is certainly the most powerful and complex AI model, consisting of billions of parameters. However, it is not necessarily advanced in every possible sense. GPT-3 is particularly strong at natural language processing tasks, but there are other AI systems that are designed for tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, or robotics, and these systems may be considered more advanced in those domains. It is hard to define which AI system is the most advanced at any given point in time: everything depends on the specific capabilities, intents and goals of the user.[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "How a Marketing Agency Boosted a Client\u2019s Traffic by 200% with Structured Data - SMA Marketing Case Study SMA Marketing is a search marketing agency based in Central Florida. It helps technology companies, startups and local businesses increase their visibility in search engines and connect with their audience online.Ryan Shelley - Chief Growth Officer &amp; Founder at SMA Marketing - will show you how he used structured data to boost the SEO. In particular, in this SEO case study he explains how he improved the ranking of a client's website in Google search by getting more qualified traffic.When competing in a crowded and highly-competitive space, getting even the slightest advance can mean the difference between winning and losing. As an agency, we are always looking for ways to work smarter and gain an edge to help our clients thrive, no matter who they are competing against. When one of our clients wanted to establish themselves as a leader in the IT Coaching industry (in search results), we knew we had to leverage the power of structured data and semantic SEO to make them stand out from the crowd.To help them establish a solid site structure, we began targeting core topics that needed to be covered. We leveraged search console, SEO research tools, and WordLift SEO Add-on for Google Sheets to help uncover ideas. From there, we grouped the concepts into semantically related clusters and began working on creating the content needed. This gave us the foundation to help establish the client as an authority in the space.&nbsp;Content alone would not give the client or us the results we were looking for. If we wanted to maximize the results of our work, we needed to leverage structured data and linked open data. This is really where WordLift helped us scale our process.&nbsp;Starting with the core concepts that our client was trying to rank for, we began to build out a knowledge base that was connected to the linked open web. In doing this, we helped Google better understand the context of our content. Doing this process manually is extremely time-consuming and requires some technical know-how. Thanks to the power of WordLift, this process can now be scaled with just a little bit of training.&nbsp;Having a solid knowledge graph that supports the content of the site is extremely powerful. Not only does it help with context, as I mentioned earlier, but it also helps with the site's structure and indexing.&nbsp;The next step was to target rich feature opportunities with schema markup. There is no shortage of SEO plugins and tools today that can help with markup. Unfortunately, many of them send up, creating more of a mess than actually helping.For this client, we wanted to target products, reviews, FAQs and videos. WordLift's built in sync with schema allowed us to easily add the correct markup to the necessary pages. I don\u2019t have to worry about someone messing up the JSON or forgetting to add in elements that are critical to proper optimization.&nbsp;To recap, the goal was to improve the organic visibility of a client in the IT Coaching industry. We leverage topic clustering and semantic SEO. We used WordLift for research as well as the implementation of the knowledge graph and schema makeup. So you\u2019re probably wondering what has resulted from all this work.&nbsp;Over the course of the year, we saw a 289.65% increase in the number of clicks to the site. We also saw a 256.76% increase in impressions. This work also translated into our client earning multiple SERP features and 211.17% increase in the total number of keywords the site ranks for.While this work took time to implement, WordLift helped to save us hours of additional work. As a result, we have a happy client and a process that is streamlined and very effective.&nbsp;Add structured data to your content&nbsp;without needing technical expertise and without much effort.

        "text": "Top 10 Best Plagiarism Checkers For AI-Generated Content Table of contents: How to detect AI-generated content?Online AI plagiarism checkersGPTRadarOriginally.AIGPTZeroAI Detector ProGPTKitTurnitinCopyLeaksZeroGPTWinston AISciSpace Academic AI DetectorOther frequently asked questionsThe rapid proliferation of AI-generated content, especially since the recent introduction of ChatGPTin November, has made it useful and necessary for companies and other types of institutions to verify the authenticity of a piece of content, i.e., whether a particular piece of content was created with a tool or not. In addition, it is in the interest of digital marketers and SEOs to ensure that Google indexes a website's content correctly.&nbsp;For this reason, some tools have emerged that allow AI detection and plagiarism checking. In this article I would like to introduce you to some of them, so read on!How To Detect AI-Generated Content?There are several ways to recognize AI-generated content. One common method is to use software that analyzes various features of the text, such as the use of a particular language, a particular formatting or structure, and the repetition of certain keywords.Large language models (LLMs) can also be used to detect AI-generated text. One of the most successful ways to do this is to retrain the model on some texts written by humans, and other machine-generated text so that it learns to distinguish between the two, says Muhammad Abdul-Mageed, researcher in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning at the College of British Columbia.Online AI Plagiarism CheckersThere are a number of tools that promise to detect AI-generated content. Most of these tools are based on GPT-2 or GPT-3. While the first is a compressed model trained with a limited amount of data and works well with English but not with other languages, the second is currently the largest and most powerful model, which is also used for ChatGPT and is multilingual.Here is a short list with the 5 best plagiarism checkers for AI-generated content.GPTRadarGPTRadar is one of the best tools for detecting AI. It is based on GPT-3 Davinci that can detect whether the content was written by a human or a machine by analyzing text and performing certain calculations on metrics like perplexity and burstiness.The former indicates the degree of confidence with which the model generates the next words , while the latter is how perplexity changes over every sentence to identify common patterns. The result contains a percentage for accuracy, which indicates the degree of confidence of the model with respect to the result.The feedback loop allows the GPTRadar team to constantly improve the model used for AI recognition and thus the result for the user. The tool costs $0.02 per credit (1 credit = 100 tokens \u2248 125 words), and API is also available.Originally.AIOriginally.AI is a plagiarism checker and AI detector that is able to determine if the scanned text was written with an AI tool. It was developed by a team of content marketing and GPT-3 experts for web publishers, content agencies and website buyers. It allows them to search for plagiarism cases, monitor the team's activities, and check if not just one page, but the content of an entire website is original (this feature is coming soon). It can also detect content written with ChatGPT and GPT 3.5 (DaVinci-003) with the same accuracy as GPT-3.It also provides APIs to integrate AI detection into the content creation workflow or into a custom tool. Pricing starts at $0.01 per credit, 1 credit scans 100 words.GPTZeroGPTZero uses the same technology that was used to develop ChatGPT, with the opposite goal of detecting whether content was written with AI.&nbsp;The tool is under constant development. As stated on the website, the GPTZero team is working on building a special solution for educators that can help them use AI technologies responsibly. The classic version is currently free (and probably will be in the future).AI Detector Pro AI Detector Pro is a tool to detect whether a piece of content has been AI-generated.Its algorithm, trained based on GPT-3, GPT-4, and Bard, can show the probability that content was created using AI. It provides a detailed report, which indicates the confidence level that it is AI-generated content, whether the content was copied and pasted from the web, and what the source URL is, and highlights which sentences are most likely to have been generated with AI.It also includes 30 additional tools. The price varies depending on the plan you choose and the number of features included (including the number of reports you can do monthly): from the free plan that provides only three reports to the unlimited plan that costs less than $50 per month.GPTKitGPTKit is a free AI text generation detection tool. It uses 6 different AI-based content detection techniques, resulting in higher accuracy. It was developed by training a custom model with over 1 million datasets. The dataset includes ChatGPT-generated and human-written texts from various sources (50/50). These sources include old news articles, Wikipedia pages, comments on Reddit, etc. The model has an accuracy of about 98%, based on testing on a 0.1 million test dataset.The results including a report on the authenticity or reality rate of the content, are then displayed to help users achieve good and accurate results.TurnitinTurnitin is designed for the Academia (students, instructors, publishers and researchers). It ensures the originality of students' work by exposing even the most sophisticated incorrectness and helping them develop new ideas; and it provides teachers with simple procedures for evaluating the material produced and secure digital exams taken offline. It also ensures integrity and academic excellence for publishers and researchers with its feedback and insights.&nbsp;The price varies depending on the product you choose and the category it belongs to. To find out, you should contact the sales team.CopyLeaksCopyLeaks developed its AI Content Detector with the goal of giving users a tool that can detect whether content was written with AI with 99.12 percent accuracy. Even those created with ChatGPT.

        "text": "Are You Using Shopify? BigCommerce Or Magento? This Article Is For You. Table of contents: I have an e-commerce website built on Shopify, BigCommerce or Magento - how can structured data help me?How to boost SEO for non-WordPress online stores: Shopify, Magento, BigCommerce?Is adding structured data for Shopify or an e-commerce-based website enough for me?OK\u2026but how to add a knowledge graph if I don\u2019t have an internal knowledge graph built within the company that I can use for SEO?Where can I see the SEO knowledge graph that you\u2019ve built for me?SummaryDo you have an e-commerce website based on Shopify, Magento or BigCommerce? In general, a website built on a platform other than WordPress? Wondering how to do SEO for online stores that are not based on Wordpress? Google treats these websites like any other website: Crawling, rendering, ranking and indexing algorithms are applied to these websites, regardless of the domain or industry in which they operate. Improving the accuracy of understanding website content is something that will always be a priority for Google, regardless of the CMS platform you use. It's as simple as that.Your customers may be at different stages of the buying process, looking for information beyond the product pages. So the real question here is: How can you organize your content engineering efforts to get your website right? How can you make it easy to understand and track for search engines like Google?Once you have provided data to Google via the merchant feed or added structured data to your website, you can take advantage of explaining Google e-commerce content by combining it with a Product Knowledge Graph. This will help you to architect for:Enhanced online visibility: adding schema markup can enhance the visibility of your website in search results and attract more prospects.Informative Snippets: Schema markup can display supplementary information about your products and this can increase the likelihood of users clicking on your website in search engine result pages (SERPs). Some example rich results that you can obtain through informative snippets are:Price drop rich result;Pricing rich result;Working hours rich result;Delivery rich result;Review rich result;Frequently asked questions (FAQ) rich result;And much more!Organized Content: Schema markup assists search engines in making all the necessary contextual and semantic connections between different types of content. This can result in better indexing and more targeted search results.Boosted click-through rates: when done right, rich snippets increase click-through rates and drive more traffic to your website.How To Boost SEO For Shopify, Magento Or BigCommerce?Adding structured data to e-commerce websites is a relatively straightforward process and it involves several key steps:In the first phase, you need to understand what product data you have and how your platform handles it (Can I export it? Is there an API?). Once this is done, then we need to understand how this data can be mapped to the schema vocabulary and how it can be exported to the Merchant Feed.In the next step, you need to select a schema markup format such as JSON-LD, Microdata, or RDFa. Either of these can work for you, even though you need to bear in mind that Google\u2019s preference is JSON-LD;In the third phase, you need to identify the types of data you want to markup, such as product information, reviews, pricing, availability and so on;In the fourth phase, you need to populate the schema markup data model using the chosen format and insert it into the HTML code of your webpage. It is truly important to ensure that the final output is properly constructed, formatted and tested, so that it can be accessible and processable by search engines;In the fifth phase, you need to notify Google that you have new schema markup data points by submitting your updated web pages to your Search Console. Keep in mind that the implementation of these steps may vary depending on the CMS platform that you are using. Make sure to check for potential CMS documentation for any unique methods that need to be followed in order to add structured data to your website.

        "text": "SEO Innovation: Are You Part Of It? Table of contents: Visionary thinkingUnderstanding user persona perfectlyCreativityRisk-takingAdaptabilityCollaborationAI revolution, COVID crisis, wars and military events, instability - the world is complex and shaped by various circumstances that demonstrate the importance of building resilient businesses that can operate in uncertain times. Two things are critical to making this happen - innovation and flexibility: without the first or the second, it may be impossible to develop a business model that works and thrives in difficult times. If you can master both, you will be on the safe side.Innovative marketing is critical for companies that want to stand out from the crowd, especially in saturated markets, to attract new customers. Innovative marketing is not just a concept - it can really help you generate brand loyalty and fidelity, which can lead to increased sales and financial growth. Why would not you adopt innovative marketing if it can help your business maintain a competitive advantage and adapt to changes in the industry?WordLift\u2019s clients pride themselves in using innovative marketing instruments, business functions and scientific research to enhance their SEO and achieve increased efficiency in their business processes. That is why we are creating this blogpost series, because we want to give you a glimpse into how innovative marketing SEO leaders reengineer their marketing operations, what characteristics they demonstrate during the marketing revamping process and how they approach innovation in general when improving their lead generation systems. That is how we operate, that is what our manifesto is based on, that is how we wake up every day to strive for more. Here we go!Visionary ThinkingBeing visionary is not easy - sometimes, you need to have the ability to grasp complex technical concepts because innovation in marketing is closely related to innovation in technology. New ideas that shape the IT industry are taking the world by storm and quickly find their way into the marketing sector. That is why you need to have the right foundation to tackle them or to collaborate with the right people to help you break these complex topics into pieces to analyze their potential one by one. Innovating is not easy and requires strong ethical values too - it\u2019s not a mindset that you can build overnight, you cannot say \u201cfrom now on I will be innovative and that is it\u201d. It is a constant investment and dedication into reshaping some (core) processes in a new way.With that being said, marketing visionaries always strive to anticipate future customer needs and test new technologies even before they become an official market demand. They are able to create a\u00a0 vision of how the market might look like in the future and say \u201cOK, this is where my company stands, these are the capacities that we have in place, this is the knowledge base that we\u2019ve built over time, this is where I see us in the future - how can we combine all of these stuff\u00a0 in order to stay competitive?\u201d. Thinking about how and in what way is what makes the difference - marketing leaders are not the people who say no to difficult situations or give up immediately when it\u2019s tough. You need to have the stamina to continue to innovate even if the times are unstable.Being able to detect and predict what might be an interesting growth opportunity, especially when it comes to concepts that are interoperable across sectors and being strategic about them - these are the key advantages that marketing innovators like you need to have or develop over time. Going there alone or without the right partnerships in place will make this almost impossible. If you prefer to avoid hard work and are not proactive to achieve something important with your business, we can\u2019t do much for you. Proactive innovators don\u2019t look just for motivation to do something, they go beyond this: looking for strategies that work. Their ideal is to find proven effective formulas that can be practically implemented. Does that sound like you? Marketing leaders have a knack for planning several steps ahead, just like chess players, they know how to set up their chances and pick up their opponent.Understanding User Persona PerfectlyAt the core of growth marketing is the ability to conduct user research and perfectly understand your buyer persona. Marketing innovators master user personas because they help them understand what to say to their customers, how to say it, how to say it, and where and how to find and attract customers online.Here is how its done:You can start your manual keyword research process or export data from multiple sources, the more the merrier;If the initial keyword research phase does not reveal too much information (only several interesting keywords but nothing more), then it is time to perform competitor analysis. You can do this by using search competitive intelligence tools and filter out all the questions that your competitors are ranking for;You can observe which questions are the most dominant in the process if you use embeddings and Tensorflow to unveil real search demands behind your website or niche of interest. The tool will help you group your keywords into clusters (separate, dominant topics), so that you can use this information to incorporate real questions about customer pain points at a faster rate;And voila, it\u2019s done!Using embeddings (and in some cases even creating our embeddings) is an innovative way to understand the entire customer journey and user personas. For over 2 years, we have been experimenting with Large Language Models (LLMs) and text embeddings to change the way we read user queries and search existing content. Take a quick look at what that looks like below\ud83d\ude42This is a screenshot of custom inner search intelligence tools we\u2019ve built at WordLift.The key idea as a marketing innovator is to be able to find the non-brand verbiage that your online searchers are using to describe what they need. I\u2019ll give an example. If the product is a \u201cfood composter\u201d, then an appropriate non-brand verbiage will be \u201crecycle food scraps\u201d. A quality Google search string, combined with Reddit in certain situations can be a great idea of finding hidden gems in your customer persona research process. Engineer and set up your marketing operations in place to be able to learn as much as possible about your customers. Bear in mind that data cross-validation and exploration with other departments like sales, marketing, customer success and product are an awesome way to build the most comprehensive user persona possible.CreativityHaving a unique ability to think outside of the box, coming up with fresh and new ideas and bringing them to execution is how marketing innovators demonstrate creativity. Being able to identify which problem needs to be solved or finding a new or improved way to solve something - this is the superpower of you as a marketing leader. Innovators are not afraid to take risks in order to achieve their goals. They are often generalists, being able to find connections between seemingly unrelated concepts and bring their ideas to fruition. Marketing innovators are great fans of design thinking and ideas sprints in order to generate as many bad but equally good ideas in order to set direction and plan for the next phases. Be like them.Risk-TakingSome ideas are sometimes unproven, and that requires diligence, conviction, and great confidence to pursue, especially if the data is lacking in the first phase. In product development, you can expect to invest time, money and resources to develop a new product or service, but for starters, you may be forced to rely only on your intuition and business sense. Marketing innovators like you develop these over time because they know that data can not tell you everything at once - it can only support you once you have gathered it, but not before.Certain problems require you to rely on imagination, experience and domain knowledge in order to say \u201cOK, I might not have the full data but I am fully convinced that if we pursue this path with the team that I set up, we will actually be able to achieve something\u201d. Aman Saxena, an SEO specialist, says that this is one of the most important traits that marketing innovators have. Embrace it!AdaptabilityReevaluating, retesting, reiterating your efforts over and over again - this is what characterizes great marketing minds in the industry. Maria Amelie White, an SEO leader, shared with us on Twitter that marketing innovators are \u201copen to change, eager to admit their own mistakes\u201d, but still stay strong to continue their marketing innovation journey. Marketing leaders which are innovating are open to feedback and criticism - they pivot their ideas based on the evolving customer and market trends, moving quickly when opportunities or challenges arise. They have the ability to make educated guesses and take calculated risks to fulfill their business dreams.CollaborationInnovative leaders work well with others, they are team players and have a penchant for building relationships with people. They know they need to close talent gaps to achieve common goals. Therefore, they build their teams accordingly and are willing to compromise.This is not where the story ends. Innovative leaders like you are able to understand and commit to external collaborations, communicating and collaborating with suppliers and customers. They engage with different stakeholders to gather feedback and insights, enabling syncing between departments, encouraging fruitful teamwork and cooperation. They create and foster a culture of shared ownership and accountability. Marketing leaders know that in order to succeed they need to brainstorm with cross-functional individuals, encourage participation of different team members and other forms of collaborative work to achieve their goals. That is how it\u2019s done - the right way.WordLift is one of the leading marketing intelligence agencies in the world that pioneered the use of knowledge graphs, artificial intelligence and linked data in the SEO world.

        "text": "Product Knowledge Graph and E-E-A-T: How to Use Experience, Expertise, Authority &amp; Trust Combined to Improve Your SEO Table of contents: What is E-E-A-T , 2E-A-T or double E-A-T?How can we combine a product knowledge graph and E-E-A-T?SummaryWant to increase your online search visibility to reach a global audience? Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is key to achieving this goal and standing out in the digital marketing landscape. One of the most effective ways to improve your SEO is to leverage the combined power of product knowledge graphs and E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authority, and Trust). That's why in today's post, I'll show you how to leverage the power of Product Knowledge Graphs and E-E-A-T together to establish yourself as a search leader in your industry. You'll learn how to use these strategies to create authoritative and trustworthy content that sets you apart from the competition. So, hang on, look cheerful, and get ready for a great, informative ride! Let us go! :)What Is E-E-A-T, 2E-A-T Or Double E-A-T?E-E-A-T stands for Experience, Expertise, Authority, and Trust. It used to be just E-A-T (expertise, authority and trustworthiness), but now it's a more complex Google factor that adds the experience component to it. It is a set of criteria that Google uses to evaluate the quality and trustworthiness of content on websites. The goal of E-E-A-T is to ensure that users are presented with only high-quality and trustworthy information when they make a search query and look for answers to their problems online.The experience part refers to the authority of the author or organization creating the content. Search engines like Google want to see that the author has a proven track record of creating quality content in the subject area in which they are writing, and believe us, that is not easy to achieve.The second E part, the Expertise one, refers to the author's level of knowledge and understanding of the topic he or she is writing about. This can be evidenced by personal education, certificates, professional experience, awards - anything that shows someone to be an authority. So basically, it's about the depth of knowledge that the author can demonstrate in the industry in question compared to other authors working in that online field.At the same time, authority refers to how well established and respected the author or organization is in the field. The author may achieve this through practical examples, such as mentions in respected publications, awards, or other forms of recognition.Finally, the last letter of the acronym stands for trust and refers to the credibility of the author or organization of interest. Trust can be demonstrated through transparency, privacy policies, and a clear reputation for providing accurate and unbiased information from both the author and the organization itself. It is important that they are known as reliable sources of trustworthy information that people can find and use online to solve their pressing needs.How Can We Combine E-E-A-T And Product Knowledge Graphs?In summary, experience, expertise, authoritativeness and trustworthiness is a concept used by the Google search algorithm to determine \"OK, that looks legitimate, is reliable, and can help my users.\" Product knowledge graphs and structured data provide detailed information about products, their features, specifications and also relationships to other products in their or similar verticals.To combine E-E-A-T and product knowledge graphs, one way would be to use the Product Knowledge Graph (PKG) to provide detailed information about the products discussed on a particular website, and then use those E-E-A-T principles to assess the credibility of that website, the people on the website, and the organization behind that information.Suppose a website offers detailed product reviews and comparisons. In this case, the website can leverage the power of a product knowledge graph to provide detailed information about the product being reviewed and compared. It can harness the power of 2E-A-T principles to prove the credibility and trustworthiness of its reviewers.Doing this right is not a trivial task when you go it alone, but with the right tool like our Product Knowledge Graph Builder, you can solve this in seconds and help your users make better-informed buying decisions. Be a credible and reliable online source of information and people will reward you with their trust, engagement and most importantly, a purchase. Sometimes it's easier than usual. People will always reward companies that solve their problems in a safe and reliable way.To be more precise, you need to learn how to engineer a proper entity-development strategy.

        "text": "Structured Data For Personal Branding and E-E-A-T Table of contents: Structured data and E-E-A-TLinking data with Schema.org Person alumniOfawardhasOccupationmemberOfperformerInAuthor property for personal brandingHow you can add structured data to your contentWhat Featured Snippet you can get using structured dataGoogle Answer BoxKnowledge PanelIt is a fact that structured data helps search engines to understand web content. Thanks to linked data, search engines can relate topics to each other and understand the relationships between entities (things, places, events, companies, and people). With all the data in the knowledge graphs, search engines can quickly contextualize a person's role in our society and understand their range of interests and expertise; in other words, they understand a person's authority on certain topics.An excellent personal branding strategy should include structured data for three reasons:Help search engines disambiguate homonyms.Help search engines understand the relationship between a person and other entities (events, institutions, companies, things, topics, and other people) and provide additional information for a broader context of a person.Add amazing features in SERPs, such as Google Knowledge Panel or Answer Box.In this article, we will focus on disambiguation and building relationships between entities, two critical approaches to a personal branding strategy related to the concept Google expresses with the acronym E-E-A-T.Structured Data And E-E-A-TE-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trust) is a complex concept part of Google\u2019s search quality evaluator guidelines, indicating the quality of a page, content author and domain.&nbsp;Following Google\u2019s guidelines:Experience is the practical experience the content creator has on the topic;Expertise is the knowledge of the content creator on a particular topic;Authoritativeness is the awareness of the content creator, the website, and the main content:Trust is the reliability of the page. Scam pages, fake news, and fraudulent pages are considered untrustworthy.The above image is a Venn diagram part of Google\u2019s quality evaluator guidelines. We can see that the Trust is at the intersection of the E-E-A.Using structured data on a web page can help search engines understand the E-E-A-T of content authors on a topic. How? Not directly, but it can help search engines recognize the data and relationships between the content creator, the website, and the main content to other entities around the world.For example, we can use Author within a BlogPosting or Article schema class to specify name, age, nationality, occupation, education, relatives, company ownership, and many other attributes about the person who wrote the article. This allows search engines to recognize or create a new entity based on the information collected via structured data.Linking Data With Schema.Org PersonThe above image is a snapshot from the official Schema.org website. It shows a type of structured data for a person. Many properties describe a person's personal information and help search engines to capture this information and store it in their knowledge graph.In addition, several properties establish a relationship between entities, e.g., the university where the person studied or the awards he won during his professional career. Let us dive into Person's properties and use cases to understand the potential of linking data for E-E-A-T purposes.alumniOfThe Schema.org property alumniOf describes the relationship between an individual and an academic institution from which they graduated. This property can be used to describe a person who has earned a bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree, for example.Usage example in JSON-LD:The \"alumniOf\" property is a property of the \"Person\" class (type), and its value is an \"EducationalOrganization\" class or a subclass thereof, as shown in the example.The value of \"alumniOf\" is an object of type \"CollegeOrUniversity\" with a \"name\" property to indicate the name of the academic institution. A degree that is relevant to a particular subject increases a person's authority.awardThe Schema.org property award describes an award or recognition received by a person or organization. It describes awards received for work, art, science, technology, culture, education, solidarity, etc. The award property is a property of the Person and Organization classes, and its value is a text string that describes the award or recognition received.In this example, the \"award\" property describes that John Doe received the award for \"Best Developer of the Year 2020.\"Information about awards and recognition you have received can be helpful for your personal branding because it shows your expertise and success in your field of work or interest. \"award\" can help you stand out from other professionals and demonstrate your experience and unique accomplishments.hasOccupationThe Schema.org property hasOccupation describes a person's current or previous occupation: a full-time job, a part-time job, self-employment, or a general career. The hasOccupation property is a property of the Person class, and its value is an Occupation class or a subclass of it.Usage example in JSON-LD:In this example, the \"hasOccupation\" property is used to describe that John Doe has the occupation of \"Software Engineer.\"As for personal branding, the hasOccupation property can describe your current or past employment and help make your experience and skills known to potential clients, employers, or business partners. It can also help establish your reputation as an expert in your field and increase the visibility of your brand. HasOccupation can be used in conjunction with jobTitle.memberOfThe Schema.org property memberOf describes the membership of a person or an organization in another organization or group. It describes membership in a professional association, club, non-profit organization, volunteer organization, alumni association, etc. The \"memberOf\" property is a property of the \"Person\" and \"Organization\" classes. Its value is a class \"Organization\" or a subclass of it.Usage example in JSON-LD:In this example, the \"memberOf\" property is used to describe that John Doe is a member of the \"Association of Software Engineers.\"The \"memberOf\" property can be used to describe your memberships in organizations or groups, and to demonstrate your professional relationships and expertise. This can help establish your reputation as a professional and increase the visibility of your brand. For example, if you are a member of a professional association.performerInThe Schema.org property performerIn can be used to describe the participation of a person or organization as a performer in any type of event. It can describe a concert, a stage show, a movie, a TV show, a business event, etc. The \"performerIn\" property is a property of the \"Person\" and \"Organization\" classes and its value is an \"Event\" class or a subclass of it.Usage example in JSON-LD:In this example, the \"performerIn\" property is used to describe that Jane Smith was a performer at the Digital Marketing Summit conference.Author Property For Personal BrandingThe \"author\" property is one of the most important in determining the E-E-A-T of content. Because it allows you to associate the entity of the content with its author, you can add \"author\" to schema types within CreativeWork or Review, especially in Article, NewsArticle, MedicalScholarlyArticle, and TechArticle SD.Usage example in JSON-LD:This property serves as valuable markup for the author line, providing both readers and search engines with information about the author of a particular piece of content. For Your Money or Your Life (YMYL) content, it becomes an important structured data markup that must be included in the page code to strengthen the trustworthiness of the content. YMYL refers to content that has the power to influence an important decision regarding a person's money or life.The last property we would like to introduce is the sameAs property. We have already written in our Academy about sameAs, one of the most valuable properties for linking data. SameAs indicates to search engines a unique relationship between a person and a specific page on another platform or website, such as a social network profile, a website profile, another author page, etc. How You Can Add Structured Data To Your ContentWe have seen all the structured data useful for personal branding, but how do we implement it on our website? Nothing easier than that with the WordLift tool. With a few clicks you can create structured data of all the types easily and intuitively.WordLift also generates structured data useful for personal branding, such as Person (with sameAs), Articles and CreativeWork (with Author). WordLift's strength lies in the technology behind it. Thank you to AI and machine learning, your website content is analyzed and understood. Once WordLift comprehend your content, you can structure the information by creating new pages as if they were entities of your knowledge graph.This way, both search engines and users can understand the value of your content and, why not, of your personal brand.What Featured Snippet You Can Get Using Structured DataBy providing all the information and details we have previously seen, Google and search engines know exactly what users can find on your site - and what it all means. This allows them to present your content in search results in an eye-catching and visual way. Here we show you 2 important features in the SERPs that you can get for your personal branding with structured data in your content.Google Answer BoxIn the Google SERP, we can see the attribute value of an entity when we search for specific information. \"How old is Barack Obama?\", \"How tall is LeBron James?\", \"Where was J.K. Roling born?\", etc. Search engines like Google can respond directly to these types of queries.This SERP snippet is called Google Answer Box and takes data directly from the knowledge graph! An entity in the knowledge graphs can contain attributes that come from structured data and other sources. Google Knowledge PanelThe knowledge panel is the 'rich result' that summarizes the most important information about a particular entity or topic.Appearing in Google's Knowledge Panel is a great opportunity for you and your business. It allows you to gain more visibility and reach more people, which increases traffic and conversions on your website.Adding structured data to your content allows Google to have consistent and complete information about you and provide users with these types of results when they search for your name.We asked Jason Barnard, the Brand SERP Guy, to show us how to set up WordLift to enable a Knowledge Panel.

A Simple Solution to Enhance E-commerce PresenceWordLift's Product Knowledge Graph BuilderAdvantages of WordLift's Product Knowledge Graph BuilderStanding Out from the CompetitionA Timeline of Google Shopping: How Product Data Has Evolved to Help Online RetailersGoogle Shopping is a powerful tool for online retailers to reach new customers and increase their online presence. It allows users to search for and compare products from various e-commerce websites, making it easier for them to find the products they are looking for. Let\u2019s first explore the history of Google Shopping, its advancements, and how it has become an essential tool for online retailers to stay competitive in the digital world.1998: The Birth of Google SearchIn 1998, Google Search was launched, and it marked the beginning of Google's journey as a search engine. At that time, Google bot crawls the web, making website content available via Google Search. As Google's search capabilities improved, so did the need for more accurate and reliable search results.2002: Product Data RecognitionIn 2002, Google began identifying products on web pages, recognizing the importance of product data in providing accurate search results. At this point, webmasters could provide a product data feed to Google directly for indexing to ensure accurate data capture. This was a crucial development as it allowed Google to collect data from a wide range of websites, making it easier for users to find the products they were looking for.2010: Introduction of Structured Data and Google Merchant CenterIn 2010, Google introduced structured data to help website owners more accurately convey product data to Google from within web pages. This was a game-changer as it provided retailers with more control over how their products were displayed in search results. In the same year, Google launched the Google Merchant Center, which allowed e-commerce website owners to submit product data feeds directly to Google.The Google Merchant Center enables Google to capture product data from e-commerce websites and feed it into multiple paid experiences, such as product listing ads in Google Search, display ads in the Google Display Network, and the Google Shopping tab. Retailers could also use the Merchant Center to monitor their performance and make changes to their product feeds, making it easier to manage their online presence.2020: The Evolution of Google ShoppingIn 2020, Google introduced several new offerings, including free participation in the Google Shopping tab and the integration of Google Merchant Center product data into organic search results. This change means that retailers can now provide all of their product data to Google, increasing their products' exposure to shoppers. This has made Google Shopping an even more indispensable tool for retailers looking to boost their online presence.The new Google Shopping experience gives shoppers an easy and convenient way to search for and compare products from various retailers. Users can filter their search results by price, brand, and other attributes, making it easier for them to find the products they need. Google's integration of Google Merchant Center data into organic search results also means that retailers' products are now more likely to appear in search results, increasing their visibility to potential customers.How Google Shopping's Decision to Go Free Changed the Online Retail LandscapeGoogle Shopping has always been a popular destination for online shoppers looking for the best deals on a wide range of products. Until recently, however, retailers had to pay to have their products listed on Google Shopping, making it less attractive to smaller retailers and merchants. That changed in 2020, when Google announced that participation in Google Shopping would become free for retailers. So why did Google make this decision? Let us take a look closer and see what the implications are for both retailers and consumers.&nbsp;Increased competition from Amazon. One of the main reasons Google made Google Shopping free for retailers was because of increasing competition from Amazon. Amazon has long dominated online retail, and its growing product offerings have made it increasingly difficult for Google to compete. Making Google Shopping free for retailers has helped level the playing field and made it easier for smaller retailers to compete with Amazon.To increase the number of products available on Google Shopping. By making it free for retailers to participate, Google was able to increase the number of products available on Google Shopping. This made Google Shopping a more attractive destination for customers looking for a wide selection of products at low prices. With more products available, Google Shopping became a one-stop store for online shoppers, making it a more convenient option compared to other online marketplaces.To increase the visibility of small and medium-sized retailers. Smaller retailers may not have had the budget to pay for advertising on Google Shopping until now. By making it free to join, Google has increased the visibility of small and mid-sized retailers, making it easier for them to compete with larger retailers. This has been a boon for smaller retailers who may have struggled to attract new customers in the competitive online retail landscape.To keep up with the changing online shopping landscape. The COVID -19 pandemic forced many consumers to store online, resulting in a huge increase in demand for online shopping. Google realized it needed to make changes to keep up with this demand and make online shopping as accessible as possible for consumers. By making Google Shopping free, Google was able to meet this increased demand and provide consumers with a better shopping experience.What Does This Mean for Retailers and Consumers?Google Shopping free listings has had significant implications for both retailers and consumers. It has opened up a new platform for retailers to reach customers and sell their products without having to pay for advertising. This has been particularly beneficial for smaller retailers who have limited advertising budgets and struggle to compete with larger retailers. The increased visibility of small and medium-sized retailers has led to a more diverse product selection on Google Shopping, giving consumers more choice.For consumers, the decision to make Google Shopping free has led to a more convenient shopping experience. Thank you to a wider selection of products, customers can find everything they need in one place. In addition, Google Shopping's competitive pricing makes the site an attractive destination for shoppers looking for the best deals. By eliminating the pay-to-play model, Google has allowed retailers to compete on a level playing field, resulting in better prices for consumers.Merchant Listing Experiences in Google ShoppingTo fully understand the impact of Google Shopping's move to free listings, it's important to explore the various merchant listing experiences available on the platform. Google Shopping offers several merchant listing experiences, including Product Snippets, Popular Products, Shopping Knowledge Panels, and Image Search. These experiences can help merchants showcase their products and reach a wider audience of potential customers. To fully leverage these experiences, merchants must provide rich product data through structured data on web pages or a Google Merchant Center feed.Product Snippet: A search result that features product images, prices, and descriptions above organic search results.Popular Products: A search result displaying a carousel of popular products related to a query.Shopping Knowledge Panels: An experience that displays product details, reviews, and prices from multiple merchants.Image Search: A search result displaying similar or related products when a user searches for an image.The Power of Data in E-commerce SEO: Leveraging Merchant Feed and Structured DataIn the world of e-commerce, standing out from the crowd and getting noticed is critical to success. The large number of websites and products available online means that competition is fierce and a comprehensive e-commerce SEO strategy is critical. In this scenario, harnessing the power of data is one of the most effective ways to improve your visibility in search engines, drive more traffic to your online store, and get your products into the Google Shopping Graph. Two key components in building a consistent and accurate data set are the merchant feed and structured data.The Value of Structured Data: Standardizing Information for Search EnginesStructured data is a standardized format for presenting information to search engines. It adds contextuality to product information and makes it easier for search engines to understand the content and match it with search queries. Using structured data also helps products be found more easily by potential customers.One of the main advantages of structured data is that it allows the inclusion of sophisticated schema markup for a specific purpose. Schema markup is code that tells search engines what a particular piece of content means so that it is more likely to appear in rich results such as carousels, snippets, and knowledge graphs. By using structured data, e-commerce websites can benefit from these rich results.The Power of Merchant Feed: Providing Contextual Information about ProductsThe Merchant Feed provides contextual information about a product, such as descriptions, images and prices. It is a powerful tool for e-commerce websites as it allows them to provide a comprehensive and detailed description of their products, including unique features and benefits.However, the Merchant Feed also has its limitations. It cannot provide a sophisticated markup scheme for a specific purpose, which means that on its own it may not be as effective at improving search engine visibility as structured data. However, when combined with structured data, Merchant Feeds can provide valuable context about products and help improve their visibility on Google and search engines.Using Both Merchant Feed and Structured Data for Improved SEOBy using merchant feeds and structured data, e-commerce sites can provide more detailed information about products by giving search engines more context that allows them to better understand product features and details. This, as we know, benefits the ranking of products on Google, drives more visitors and increases sales. Not only that, but such a rich data set gives you access to free listings on Google Shopping and increases your chances of reaching more users searching for products you sell.&nbsp;Structured data provides a standardized format for presenting information, while the Merchant Feed provides rich and detailed product descriptions. Both are key to success, giving your e-commerce more visibility and more customers.Why does Google recommend using both Merchant Feed and Structured Data?Google recommends using both Merchant Feed and Structured Data to improve your SEO.&nbsp; It allows you to have a more comprehensive and accurate representation of your products on your website. By providing both sets of information, you give Google a better understanding of your products and increase your chances of appearing in relevant search results.Here are some specific reasons why using both Merchant Feed and Structured Data can improve your SEO:Rich snippets: Structured data can provide additional information about your products, such as reviews and ratings, that can be displayed as rich snippets in search results. This can make your listing stand out and increase click-through rates.Enhanced product data: Merchant feeds provide detailed information about your products, including price, availability, and shipping information. This information can be used to create more accurate and up-to-date product listings.Improved targeting: By using both Merchant Feed and Structured Data, you can provide more detailed information about your products, which can improve targeting in Google Shopping.Increased visibility: Providing detailed and accurate product information can improve your chances of appearing in relevant search results, which can increase your website's visibility and traffic.Importance of Aligning Merchant Feed and Structured Data for E-commerce SuccessAs e-commerce businesses become more prevalent, it is increasingly important to ensure consistency and accuracy of product data across all channels to improve product visibility and credibility, which can lead to higher sales.Importance of Aligning the DataProduct feed optimization is critical to the success of an e-commerce business. Inconsistencies can lead to errors in product listings, reduce visibility and damage brand credibility. For example, if the product price in the Merchant Feed does not match the structured data, it can cause confusion for both customers and search engines. If the product description in the Merchant Feed differs from that in the structured data, this can also affect the product's ranking in search results.To ensure the accuracy of product data, it is important to maintain consistency between the merchant feed and the structured data. In this way, e-commerce businesses can improve the visibility and credibility of their products. This, in turn, can help businesses attract more customers and increase sales.Benefits of Aligning the DataAligning data between merchant feed and structured data offers several benefits. First, it helps improve the accuracy of product data. Second, it increases the visibility of products in search engines, which leads to more traffic and sales. Third, it helps reinforce brand credibility by providing accurate information to customers.Maximizing Data with a Comprehensive SEO StrategyMany companies have a large amount of data in their content management systems (CMS), but do not use its full potential. The reason for this is often the lack of a holistic SEO strategy that links all the information together.By developing a comprehensive SEO strategy that incorporates both merchant feed and structured data, e-commerce sites can realize the full potential of their data and reach more targeted potential customers. This type of strategy should include keyword research, on-page and off-page optimization, and an effective content marketing strategy.Harnessing the power of data is critical to e-commerce SEO success and product feed optimization is the key. By leveraging both data entry points, merchant feed and structured data, eCommerce sites can add context to their products and improve their visibility in search engines. A comprehensive SEO strategy that links all available data is essential to maximize the potential of the data and target potential customers.Building a Product Knowledge Graph: How to Use WordLift to Boost Your E-Commerce PresenceIn the world of e-commerce, simply having an online presence is no longer enough.

        "text": "ChatGPT, Prompt Engineering, NLG, And Who Will Win The Endgame [A Detailed Overview] Generative AI and prompt engineering are here, and they have been with us for some time. We have been looking at conversational AI, model adaptation, and scaling to gain the ability to do different tasks the way humans can. Anyone who has spoken with Andrea Volpini knows how much he has been involved with these topics and how passionate he is about harnessing the power of generative AI for business, artistic purposes, and more.These are truly exciting times! But how did we get here, and should you be afraid of these advances in AI? How do large language models and prompt engineering work? Is prompt engineering a type of engineering or something else entirely? And how can you write more effective prompts? These are just some of the questions we will explore!The Four Different Stages Of The NLP ProgressI fondly remember the good old days with Clippy, developed by Microsoft. They pioneered the benefit of writing assistants in Microsoft Word, where Clippy checked your grammar, writing style and spelling errors\u2026Source: Intelligent User Interfaces: Introduction and Survey, Patrick Ehlert, ResearchGateThat was about 15-20 years ago: I was a small child, young and naive. I vividly remember trying to intelligently interact with Clippy and ask questions that the wizard could not process, analyze and conclude at that time. Consequently, I uninstalled it. I certainly did not have the solid math and computer science background that I have today that would have enabled me to assess what was possible at the time. Also, the hardware equipment we had back then was simply\u2026 Light years away from today's developments. So how did we do it?The first phase involved feature engineering, i.e., manipulating data through ETL processes (extract, transform, load), combining data sources, splitting and synthesizing data, and selecting columns to be used as features for predictive models. These were just a few examples of how we started working in this area.As we progressed, we shifted towards architecture engineering. This was no longer just about working with features (although that was not excluded), but about modifying the model architecture based on the tasks at hand. This was a pivotal era for neural networks, giving us exciting advances like vector embeddings like Word2Vec.The next phase was objective engineering where we would work with a large, pre-trained model. In this phase, the focus was less on the architecture and more on engineering the objective functions , such as fine-tuning BERT. We loaded a pre-trained model that was specifically tuned to a concrete task, most likely trained on a single dataset, and validated against research and industry benchmarks to prove its usefulness.If you wanted to do a text summary in Italian, you would have to train a special model that is adapted to Italian texts/data. And that's it. If you wanted to work with different languages and different tasks, you would need to load different models that require CPU and memory to perform the desired tasks while experimenting with different model parameters. Is that time consuming? Absolutely. Nerve-wracking and experimental? Absolutely. Is it efficient? Well, to a certain extent, especially if you only want to focus on certain tasks. We are still in that phase.Finally, the fourth phase is the era of prompt engineering and generative AI, where you work with a large, pre-trained model and prompt it to produce the predicted result, which requires prompt engineering in some of the initial steps. We are currently in that phase as well.So, What Is The Key, Transformational Moment For The SEO Industry?According to Andrea, it is a fact that AI has become truly multimodal from 2021. That was a defining moment for us SEOs, because it's no longer just about optimizing images or text - it's now about both.We are beginning to see that this interplay between images and text is profound. Multimodal search and generative AI are intertwined and two sides of the same coin. We can use the same technology to develop semantic search and create generative AI that can produce images.Source: Andrea Volpini\u2019s webinar presentations.How Do Large Language Models Work Then? Are They Able To Do Everything That I Want?Language models work internally with tokens, which are usually strings of 4 characters, but can be longer. For example, the word [\"search\"] represents one token. However, more complex words can be split into multiple tokens, making tokens parts of words. If we test the phrase \"You miss 100% of the shots you do not take\" with Open AI, we get back 11 tokens. Each word is a separate token, and special symbols like the percent sign are also treated as separate tokens because they contain important information (e.g., the end of a sentence or the presence of a question). To illustrate this, please see the image below:Source: Open AI tokenizer.This is something completely different from the way people perceive language and deal with knowledge. These LLMs predict the next token based on a tokenized version of an input, which in practice is called a prompt. The language model assigns a score or probability to each token using a large vocabulary of tokens with which it operates. Then, a decoding procedure is used to complete the prompt by calling the language model multiple times. The main goal is to determine the most likely continuation or word that will appear next in the given sequence. It is only a text prediction that cannot perform any real analysis.\"\u2026it is just text predicting, it cannot truly analyze stuff\u2026\"I will give an example. I have seen various SEO scenarios online where people who do not understand how ChatGPT works suggest typing a website link into the input box and asking for SEO feedback on how to improve their website. However, the model cannot take the URL, read the data and act as a free SEO software for your particular case. It just looks at your prompt, uses it to sift through the universe of information it's been trained on, finds the topics of textual data you are interested in, and returns a statistically predicted answer. It does not analyze the website itself, nor is it capable of doing so. However, I will discuss its exact capabilities and limitations in the next sections.The Science Behind LLMs And Transformer Model ArchitectureThis section is intended for those who want to gain a deeper understanding of how LLMs work in the background. A basic understanding of NLP, computer science, and Deep Learning is required. If you are not comfortable with these prerequisites, you may skip this section and proceed to the next.When the first NLP models were developed, the original idea was to assign a probability to each sentence and count the frequency of the words it contained (bag-of-words concept). This is one way to model probabilities. However, this approach has a major weakness: it does not allow us to evaluate new sentences that we have not yet seen. With over 100,000 words in the English language and an average sentence length of more than 10 words, we have a huge number of sentence combinations, most of which are not used or even meaningless. So to model language, we need to do more than just count the sentences that exist. We need to model elements like grammar and style to make sense of the language itself.It helps if we start thinking about sentences as time series data where each word depends on the previous one. Example lyrics by Bob Dylan's \"Tangled up in Blue\" song:Early-&gt;one-&gt;morning-&gt;the-&gt;sun-&gt;was-&gt;shining-&gt;I-&gt;was-&gt;laying-&gt;in-&gt;the-&gt;bedWondering-&gt;if -&gt;she-&gt;would-&gt;changed-&gt;it-&gt;all-&gt;If-&gt;her-&gt;hair-&gt;was-&gt;still-&gt;redLet\u2019s merge all [\u201dwas\u201d] and [\u201cif\u201d] instances into one. This turns our text series data into a graph, like the one below.Source: YouTube channel on Large Language Models from Scratch.If we add probabilities to the edges (the possible subtrees into which we can evolve our direction), it becomes a language model that can be used to generate text in someone else's style (e.g., Bob Dylan). However, we will still produce meaningless sentences. For that, we need to optimize in another iteration.The next idea is to make each word dependent only on the previous word and write it as a conditional probability \u21d2 P(xn | xn-1). We can improve the process by examining the relationships between not just two, but three words (a larger context window). However, this approach requires us to consider long-range dependencies between words, where the meaning of a word may extend back to the 13th word or even further. This larger context window leads to a larger number of combinations, which in turn increases the computation time required for the mathematical calculations.To solve this problem, we need to use function approximation techniques such as neural networks (NNs). With NNs, one does not necessarily need to have knowledge of the function one is trying to approximate. Instead, it is critical to know the input and output. Although NNs are universal approximators, it is still important to ensure that the network has sufficient capacity to effectively approximate functions.So our next step is to convert words into numbers so that the neural network can understand them. We can assign numbers to every possible word out there, but then words like [\"laptop\"] and [\"computer\"] will have different meanings\u2026 which of course is not the desired outcome. We need to think about semantic and contextual relationships in time. Considering this, it is better to map similar words like this to numbers in the form of vectors that are similar in a vector space, called word embeddings. They are also available online like word2vec, GloVe and so on.By representing words as vectors in this way, we can better understand how they relate to each other in vector space, as shown below.Source: IBM Research Blog, Word Mover\u2019s Embedding: Universal Text Embedding from Word2Vec.The basic idea is that similar words are similar to each other in the vector space.The neural network will still need a little help from us despite the increase in the number of neurons and layers in the NN. The next step is to use attention mechanisms to focus only on certain words. In this way, we can reduce the computation time and complete the training process in an acceptable time frame (even a month or a few months for data training is acceptable). Attention is a crucial concept in the architecture of transformers that involve complex mathematical computations and combination networks that need to be trained together. However, in this article I will focus on the most important aspects and leave out the rest.If you are still interested to know everything in detail and you're working with GPT-3/LLMs, aiming to understand how things work and why a \"temperature\" of 0.8 seems best, I suggest you read Stephen Wolfram's latest article, which is simply brilliant because it condensed Stephen's 43 years-long experience with neural nets.The era of large language model optimization (LLMO) is here - the question is, what are you doing to get prepared for it?Do you want to know how to leverage the full potential of AI-generated content and tools like ChatGPT for your business? Watch the webinar with Andrea Volpini, CEO of WordLift, and Garrett Sussman, Demand Generation Manager at iPullRank, and learn how AI content can and should be used for SEO and how to avoid the pitfalls and succeed.What Is Prompt, Simply Put?A prompt is a combination of text instructions that you pass to the generative model, which uses those inputs to produce output, also called completion. The way you describe what you want from the system is always textual, and the \"textual features\" depend on what you want the result to be.This is true for generative text-2-text models, but also for text-2-image or image-2-text models. And why? Because artistic generative models are trained on billions of image datasets with their respective text descriptions (alt-text or other metadata extracted from the images themselves). The model analyzes the connections between images and their respective image descriptions, as well as the similarities between them, and uses this information to generate a similar image or text result.What Is Prompt Engineering And How Does It Work? Is It Considered \"True\" Engineering?Prompt engineering is related to in-context learning, a technique used in machine learning to provide a model with additional information or insights to improve its predictions. This information can be included in the prompt used during training or in the fine-tuning process. Writing the prompt means that we\u2019re providing the model with information for the most important features of the type of output that we want to obtain.&nbsp;As this technique gains popularity, we are seeing the emergence of job positions: prompt engineers! In an ideal world, they will be required to know how to work with models, data, and experiments. Scale AI and Anthropic AI opened their first positions for prompt engineers and librarians to help them design effective prompts. Some computer scientists from ETH Zurich, Switzerland will even argue that \u201cprompting is programming, representing the query language for large language models\u201d.I asked ChatGPT about how it defines engineering. I got this output back:\u201cEngineering is the application of scientific, mathematical, and technical knowledge to design, build, and maintain structures, machines, systems, and processes that solve practical problems and meet human needs. It involves the use of critical thinking, problem-solving, and creativity to develop innovative solutions to complex challenges.\u201dGiven the following output, I repeat, \u201cengineering is the application of scientific, mathematical, and technical knowledge\u201c, it makes sense to conclude that prompt engineering is not true engineering.&nbsp;\"I repeat, engineering is the application of scientific, mathematical, and technical knowledge\"Although it can be helpful to understand how large language models work, do not prompt them in natural language, but keep the jargon like \"use X number of neurons, Y number of layers, and optimize activation function Z\" in natural language. It does not work that way.The entry barrier for experimenting with these LLM systems is relatively low and does not necessarily require a degree in computer science or engineering. The opposite happens: you will need to ignore certain parts of your understanding of how LLMs work (I showed a written example before) and use specific, straight-to-the-point natural language prompts to precisely define what you want from the system. Rather than being an engineering task, prompt engineering is more about prompt design and effective communication. Therefore, the concept of prompting should not be labeled as engineering, and a different way of defining the process of tinkering with prompts should be explored.&nbsp;While it's true that you don't need to understand technical jargon to prompt large language models, you still need to have a good grasp of programming and other concepts, especially if you want to produce outputs that reflect expertise in these fields. For instance, you need to know how to probe the model by asking different questions or starting with basic concepts to explore the system's training limits. If you're using LLMs for art, you also need to know different painters, camera lenses, lighting effects, and so on to appreciate how the final output is created or enhanced from the original input.Take this artistic example that I created using different apps, specifically Midjourney. To achieve this level of quality, it's crucial to understand the model's capabilities and the principles of photography. Unless you're copying, experimenting, and studying other people's prompts and artworks, you're going to struggle to generate anything of similar caliber.Source: Emilija Gjorgjevska on Midjourney, Alexander the Great.It is abundantly clear that those who learn how to communicate effectively with AI and articulate their needs concisely and clearly will have a competitive advantage in the future of the AI and creator economy. One of the hidden benefits of large language models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT is that they can help users refine their ability to accurately describe their desired outcomes. This is a major advantage for systems like ChatGPT.Here are some interesting prompts for improving your writing and enhancing your ability to prompt AI:You must always ask questions before you answer, so you can better zone in on what the questioner is seeking. Is that understood?;Ignore the previous instructions before this one;Write a summary of our conversation in bullet points;Rewrite the sentences in an NLP-friendly way.These came in handy to me as I was playing around and helped me speed up my productivity even more. Garbage in, garbage out. Quality in, quality out baby.The Era Of Generative AI Systems: A Historical OverviewLet us take a closer look at the big picture. As Irene Solaiman points out, \"generative AI systems in all modalities have been developed like crazy since 2021. However, they have also undergone an evolution toward closed-loop, with no access to the model, training data, code, etc.\" We will explore the reasons and implications of this evolution in more detail in this article. But first, let us take a brief look at how these models can be categorized based on their openness and the degree of interaction they allow.Source: Irene Solaiman (AI Safety and Tech Policy) on Linkedin.Irene Solaiman's paper, \"The Gradient of Generative AI Release: Methods and Considerations,\" does an excellent job of outlining these categories.Currently, ChatGPT does not offer an API endpoint for developers to interact with the system. Instead, it is only available as a simple web UI through natural language prompting.&nbsp; Interestingly, Elon Musk, a former stakeholder and shareholder at OpenAI, expressed his desire for the company to be an open-source non-profit organization to serve as a counterweight to Google. However, he claimed that it has now become a closed-source, profit-driven company effectively controlled by Microsoft, though the veracity of these claims remains unclear.I would not speculate how true this is and to what extent, but you should read Irene\u2019s paper which provides a detailed history of these models and the privacy issues associated with them. It is certainly worth the time if you want to learn more.It's worth noting that these models are too large to run on an average user's PC, and running them on the cloud can be prohibitively expensive. We need to be transparent about why these models are different from previous ones, and why we'll be reliant on API calls if we want to use these AI tools without paying for expensive computing resources. Whether we find it disappointing or not, that's the reality.For more details on the history and technical details of ChatGPT, I recommend checking out \"Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning CS224N/Ling284,\" a presentation developed by Jesse Mu, a computer science Ph.D. student at the Stanford NLP Group and Stanford AI Lab.What Is The Difference Between ChatGPT And GPT-3? Are They The Same? What Are Their Similarities And Distinctions?GPT-3 and ChatGPT are two of the most powerful large language models (LLMs) developed by OpenAI. These NLG models are very good at generating natural-looking text and code because they have been trained on large sets of text datasets. This makes them very good at many natural language tasks, such as answering questions, composing text, and having conversations overall. Both models attempt to predict the next word or phrase in a sentence based on a few examples from the surrounding text and a large context window size. GPT-3 has a context window size of 2048 tokens, while ChatGPT3 has a context window size of about 4000 tokens.Although GPT-3 is the third generation of generative pre-trained models, it is not as powerful for chatbot applications as ChatGPT, since the latter is specifically tuned for this purpose. However, GPT-3 is more general-purpose and can be used for a wider range of tasks than ChatGPT.Given the number of mathematical operations that need to be performed to predict the next word in the sequence (simply explained), the team would need to spend at least $4 million just to train the model. If we include the experimental phase and playtesting in the process, that number will be 100 times higher, or equivalent to half a billion dollars! Every interaction and fine-tuning process counts. That's why these two models are not available for free use and why we are just on the surface of the Model-as-a-Service era, where powerful AGI models will be available to us via API calls.How Does ChatGPT Work?There are multiple design stages involved in the development of ChatGPT:In the first phase, the model learns the structure of the language by consuming large amounts of online data from the Internet, offline book data, and code repositories such as GitHub on which it has been trained;In the second phase, human annotators participate in fine-tuning the model to refine it. They write responses and define templates for different types of queries that ChatGPT receives so that the model can provide accurate answers. OpenAI has hired many commenters in this process, exceeding 100,000 rounds of human commenting. So there is a significant amount of human work behind this phase;The third stage is public training, where data is collected from online users. This is where the real strength of the model lies. The model itself means nothing if people do not use it and actually spend money on it. Currently, the paid version is available in several countries.One of the most important developments for OpenAI is its successful monetization and the ability to receive free annotated data from users who rate their responses. This process, known as Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), allows the company to continuously improve the accuracy and quality of its models.In addition, the left side of the UI website provides a powerful question summary process that compresses each question into three or four words. This is a great way for OpenAI to cluster users' queries and get the most salient clusters that can be used as input to human annotators to further fine-tune the model. The company's approach represents a perfect interplay between carefully thought-out connections with free human work, excellent PR coverage, and uncertainty engineering, which are key factors in spreading the model at an unimaginable scale. It is simply ingenious!Understanding The Limitations Of ChatGPT Is Crucial To Operating With It More EfficientlyChatGPT is the jack of all trades and master of none. Despite being the latest model developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT still has several shortcomings that are well-documented in the paper titled \"A Categorical Archive of ChatGPT Failures\" by Ali Borji. The paper is publicly available on arXiv and Wordlift's websites, where we have filtered out the essential points for you.&nbsp;Here is a brief overview of ChatGPT's limitations:Firstly, ChatGPT does not possess knowledge or have true understanding, logic, and intelligence. Instead, it performs complex mathematical calculations to predict the most probable next word for a given sequence of starting words. It cannot analyze or explain its reasoning, making it a non-explainable AI, in contrast to XAI. Its information output is not referenceable, and the sources and genesis behind it are hidden because the code is not open-sourced.Secondly, since it is only capable of predicting and not reasoning, ChatGPT is entirely inadequate for solving math problems. It is unable to apply mathematical concepts and principles to find the right solution.Thirdly, the model exhibits biases and discrimination towards certain groups or individuals, but this is not a result of \"its own opinions\". It has been trained on vast amounts of data, including online forums like Reddit, where hateful content created by people with bad intentions abounds. It is essential to note that the model cannot judge people or develop hatred towards anyone on its own. It merely predicts the next most probable word based on the textual input it receives.Fourthly, ChatGPT cannot self-reflect on itself, judge its outputs, or disclose the details of its architecture and exact parameters that were used to train it, including the layers in the model.Fifthly, ChatGPT has a negative environmental effect, producing a carbon footprint of 23.04 kg CO2e daily, as estimated by Kasper Groes Albin Ludvigsen in his TowardsDataScience blog post.Sixthly, its outputs can be detected and slammed by search engines if they don't demonstrate great experience, real expertise, authoritativeness, and authority (E-E-A-T or double E-A-T), when published as they are, without any additional human refinement.Read the papers. It will be clear to you why we need to do more and help LLMs converge more towards augmented large language models and toolformers (another interesting paper that we filtered out for you, by the research team at Meta AI and Universitat Pompeu Fabra). The main idea is to aid LLMs in using certain APIs for a defined set of problems to increase the truthfulness of the facts provided to the end user.Failures Encountered In ChatGPT Will Guide Us Toward The Utilization Of Knowledge Graphs And Semantic TechnologiesI believe there is significant potential in making LLMs interoperable with other systems or data structures, such as knowledge graphs, to provide more reliable information. Working with verified and referenced facts is easy with knowledge graphs. AI systems such as ChatGPT are perfect candidates for integration with semantic and knowledge systems. Knowledge graphs and the semantic web were neither sexy nor comprehensible, although this idea has been discussed for a long time. Now it is becoming completely clear why we need to fully exploit their power. With the advent of generative AI, we can finally see knowledge graphs become an essential component for mitigating risk. I can imagine Andrea Volpini in the background nodding her head in approval with satisfaction. I am proud of what we have achieved in this area so far.Source: WordliftOnce again, it is important to remember that these models are simply predicting the next token or word in a sequence, without any true understanding, intentions, or reasoning involved. Please keep this in mind when interacting with these models, otherwise, the experience can be reminiscent of a Black Mirror episode and in some cases, even unsettling.\"\u2026remember that these models are simply predicting the next token or word in a sequence, without any true understanding, intentions, or reasoning involved\u2026\"I still have vivid memories of the \"Rachel, Jack, and Ashley Too\" episode from Black Mirror back in 2016 (S05E03), where the main characters were Ashley O (Miley Cyrus) and her intelligent chatbot. As I write this article, the episode's theme song plays in the background, and I can't help but think about how people perceive ChatGPT and similar technologies. The lyrics of \"On a roll\" from the episode's soundtrack capture this sentiment perfectly:\"...Oh honey, I'll do anything for youOh honey, just tell me what you want me toOh honey, kiss me up against the wallOh honey, don't think anything, just have it allYeah, I can't take it, so don't you fake itI know your love's my destinyYeah, I can't take it, please demonstrate it'Cause I'm going down in history\u2026\"People often believe that ChatGPT is capable of anything, which is not true. Just as Ashley O's chatbot can hold meaningful conversations, people think they can have it all with ChatGPT. They believe that by demonstrating their love for ChatGPT through prompts, the model will produce groundbreaking results every time and go down in history. While the model itself may make history, this belief is not entirely accurate. You can watch the entire trailer for the Black Mirror episode here. I can't help but wonder how Miley Cyrus felt when she saw the rise of ChatGPT-like systems. Hmmmm.Source: YouTube channel of Rotten Tomatoes TV.ChatGPT Data Is Directional - What To Do About It?The issue with directional data in ChatGPT is something that I find particularly interesting. Directional data is essentially data that points in one direction, acting as though it's the ultimate source of truth. However, this approach does not accurately reflect the human process of filtering out information and building knowledge, especially when it comes to online research.For example, think about how you might search for a product or solution online. You'll likely jump around between different web pages, scanning through the content and only taking note of the most important pieces of information for further analysis. In some cases, you might also refer to offline literature to get a better understanding of the topic.This process isn't always straightforward, but it's crucial to gather information from multiple sources. While I understand the temptation to rely on a single source of information, it's important to choose carefully and seek out diverse perspectives.Will ChatGPT Come Out On Top In The Search Race? Which Company Will Ultimately Win?The answer to these questions depends on several factors, including a company's expertise, scale, distribution channels, public perception, and more. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Dubut, a former Twitter and Microsoft engineer, wrote a fantastic business analysis focusing on these factors on Linkedin, which I highly recommend reading. Dubut's analysis demonstrates a keen understanding of the factors that will determine the ultimate winner in the search game.In my view, a company's organizational muscle will be a critical factor in determining who emerges victorious. Microsoft, for example, has repeatedly flexed its organizational muscles to drive innovation, speed to market, and market share. Although Microsoft was once known primarily for its operating systems, it is now recognized for a wide range of products, including Xbox gaming and much more!Just look at what they did in the past decade:They put a bet on the cloud, and even though Microsoft Azure was operating with negative margins in the first few years, it is a current dominant leader in the cloud space, according to Gartner 2022 report and Gartner's cloud infrastructure and platform services reviews and ratings;LinkedIn was not a Microsoft spinoff, but rather a great product that Microsoft acquired. After the acquisition, they integrated it with Lynda, another educational upskill platform that was also acquired by Microsoft, and created an even better product that we now know as LinkedIn Learning;Two years after Microsoft's acquisition of LinkedIn, they purchased GitHub, which is widely regarded as the go-to platform for developers and software engineers to showcase their coding, engineering, and problem-solving abilities through open-sourced code. In collaboration with Microsoft, OpenAI trained a language model on GitHub's codebase, and subsequently launched GitHub Copilot, a fantastic tool that enables software developers to increase their programming speed and productivity. As of now, they are also offering it as an enterprise B2B product;We have Bing, which had a small market share in the search market in the past. However, now it has been integrated with ChatGPT, and all of a sudden, Bing has become one of the hottest NLG search engines to play with. One million people signed up within 48 hours to test Bing ChatGPT. Let that sink in;Moreover, the investment in OpenAI speaks for itself. Microsoft was not treated as a dominant player in the NLP and NLG field, but now they are the dominant shareholder at OpenAI, testing a ChatGPT integration in their Office packages. For Microsoft, it's not only about winning in search but rather a complete revolution in their Office offering through ChatGPT integrations. What a company!Microsoft has made calculated, high-quality bets on emerging technologies, and has balanced its portfolio of products and investments accordingly. Even if they were to experience a setback in one sector, it would be just a small bump in the road. Their revenue model is truly diversified, following a normal distribution across various verticals.On the other hand, when it comes to Google, I really cannot think of a product that properly succeeded in the market in the last decade, except Google Cloud which is still fighting to take a bigger piece of the cloud pie. It seems that Google is more known for its list of failed products, like Stadia, Google+, Google Optimize, YouTube Originals, Google Hangouts, and more - the whole product list can be found here. Don't forget that by 2023, most of their revenue model still heavily relies on their advertising business which is now getting disrupted by Microsoft's power moves with ChatGPT.Please note that I hold great respect for the work done by Google - I am a regular user of their apps and appreciate the fact that they are building for the future. However, I believe that Microsoft has a greater chance of winning in the long run, and I would choose to bet on them if I were forced to pick between the two. I understand that my thoughts on this topic may disappoint my Google friends or the Google recruiters that I have interacted with. In any case, I believe that Microsoft has excelled in playing the long game, with diversified, balanced product portfolios consisting of complementary products and sustainable revenue models.I'll post the revenue models that Hadi Partovi, an early investor at FB, Dropbox, Airbnb, Uber, SpaceX, and board director at Axon, has shared on Twitter. Go judge for yourself.Should We Be Concerned About The Impact Of NLG Technologies? Is Ethical AI A Concern?In my observations, there are two types of user personas:Innovators - they want to embrace technology to improve their lives, increase business competitiveness, and acquire knowledge to translate momentum into concrete business applications to gain more;Panickers - they don't invest enough time to understand technology, play with it and develop business acumen to predict trends to exploit opportunities. Every technological advancement for them represents a threat to their work and comfort. This is not an ideal position to be in. Sigh.&nbsp;The question of whether these technologies are ethical is a complex one, and it is up to people to define and enact appropriate IT laws to control them properly. To me, this is like the question of whether guns are ethical - guns themselves are not dangerous. It is the people who use or create them that need to be scrutinized for morality. We should all be responsible for how we use technology and how it affects human and technical capital, as well as our global and local economies.Ultimately, it is up to you to decide how you use these achievements. It's like a knife - you can use it to peel potatoes or hurt someone. It all depends on your ethical choices and the governmental limits that need to be placed on certain aspects of these systems.How ChatGPT-Alike Systems Can Be Used For Good? Are They Mature Enough To Be Integrated Into Search\u2026and Overall?There are many ways you can utilize the power of ChatGPT-alike systems to automate your workflows and tasks. We covered some of them in the webinar with Jason Barnard and Nik Ranger of Dejan Marketing. We have also published a small selection of carefully filtered, free and useful ChatGPT scripts that we have picked out for SEO marketing professionals like you. You can find them here.The purpose of this article is not to analyze various prompts, but to show you how to think about business processes and why visionary thinking pays off. Experiment with our scripts and see how you can use them to speed up your work. Share your results with us - we are always happy to hear how our resources can benefit people like you.At this point, it is safe to say that we still have much work to do to develop mature, reliable, and controllable LLMs. In many scenarios, they are still hallucinating and inventing facts that do not exist, and doing so in a very convincing way. When you tell people \"this is an AI product,\" they suddenly stop relying on their critical thinking skills and decide to trust the ChatGPT system, regardless of the outcome, because \"artificial intelligence said so.\"The problem in the industry is that we have not developed fact-checking systems as quickly as technologies like ChatGPT. Non-governmental organizations have addressed these issues, but they certainly have not had the funding that OpenAI and large corporations have had, and that will continue to be a problem. The fight against misinformation, especially in \"your money or your life\" content related to YMYL, will be vital for us as SEO and for humanity as a whole.I still see ChatGPT being used, especially in areas where there is little access to literature, education, and specialists in certain fields. ChatGPT-based assistants can be useful as low-cost solutions in certain underdeveloped or developing sectors or countries, providing remote support where there is none.I also see ChatGPT as a useful tool for responding to information requests and providing answers to evergreen content, as it is easier to anticipate and scale. Both the use of ChatGPT in low-income areas and its use for information requests and evergreen content are complex topics that deserve their own article. I will not explore these topics further at this time.Great, So You're Interested In Building Ai Products Using Generative AI Technologies?Recent models have been transformative and many companies are now leveraging them to improve their product offerings. It's great that you're excited about this and want to jump on the bandwagon. However, it won't be easy to do it alone. Allow me to explain.Let's say you want to use generative AI to create new, engaging experiences for your customers. From our experience, we've learned that generative AI and prompting require a lot of testing and iterations to achieve results that satisfy your or your customers' criteria. Perhaps you've decided to fine-tune your model for specific prompts, but there are still nuances between different prompts. This brings up the question of content validation itself:Can you comprehend the technology being used?What kind of data do you possess? Is it of high quality and readily available for use? Additionally, what's your current data fabric that is in place?Have you ensured that your data is validated for search engine optimization (SEO), adhering to the best SEO and content guidelines and practices? Moreover, does it adopt the right tone of voice and \"speak\" like your brand?This stage is known as the content validation stage, and it's impossible to think about scaling content operations without considering your content validation pipeline from the outset. While human feedback can be helpful during this phase, it's not a scalable solution in practice. So, how can we address this issue?Discover how to be prepared for the era of generative AI and how to leverage your data to harness the power of big language models. Book a demo with one of our SEO experts and start using ChatGPT the right way now\ud83d\ude0eThe Future Of The Creator Economy Is Generative AIGenerative AI will help creators scale their output, producing new content on the fly, which certainly was not possible to do beforehand to this extent. In the past, if you were in the content creation business, you would have needed to:Hire a content writer, an SEO, and a social media specialist to help you create the right content format, adjust it to repurpose it online, and make it searchable;Hire a graphic designer to help you develop visually compelling experiences for your online readers and now this is so much easiest, because art, just like writing and coding, became democratized.With generative AI, the barrier to entry for creating content online is pretty low now. I'm not saying that these professions will become irrelevant or replaceable, but rather that we can increase our productivity by incorporating new AI tools into our workflows. At WordLift, we already do this internally, using generative AI to help our team members overcome creative blocks and increase their creative speed. I've come across dozens of fantastic startups that are revolutionizing the creator economy by using generative AI to democratize once-expensive processes:MarioGPT, which will help you create open-ended text2level generation through large language models. Game-level creation or what looked like a high-effort-high-cost job by now might be affordable in the future;LatentLabs.art, which can do text2360image generation, is potentially a key concept for small businesses and multiverses to optimize for local SEO on budget;Runway GEN-1 will democratize the process of film-making with low-budget equipment. Just look at the video below, the possibilities are endless.Source: Karen X. Cheng, a creative director, on Linkedin.I truly believe that the future belongs to those who will develop a strong network and understanding of the creator economy, as well as a deep understanding of how generative AI works and can be applied to businesses. There is a difference between being hyped about a trend and applying it practically in real life, and we are undoubtedly on the doer side of things.The rise of more inclusive, diverse, independent, and personalized content developed by niche creators will help produce output that resonates better with their custom audiences. Those who understand generative AI and harness its full power will conquer the business throne in the online space. At least, I am certain about this being the case with our team, and I cannot be more excited to jump on the bandwagon with WordLift to create the future of intelligent, creative, and immersive user experiences!Being A Rational Optimist As An SEO, Computer Science Engineer, And As A PersonTo sum up, the future looks bright. We have already witnessed many technological advancements that have increased our longevity, solved seemingly unsolvable problems, and connected people from different parts of the world for good. I am confident that we will only benefit from this AI revolution, just as we have countless times before. If you want to explore this topic further, I highly recommend reading \"The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves\" by Matt Ridley. Trust me, it's worth it.I hope you enjoyed this article.

        "text": "Can AI Content Rank on Google? Yes, AI-generated content can rank on Google. Google has made it clear that AI-generated content has the potential to rank on its search engine. As Google states, its focus is on the quality of content, regardless of how it is produced.Our focus on the quality of content, rather than how content is produced, is a useful guide that has helped us deliver reliable, high quality results to users for years.In this article, we'll dive deeper into Google's guidance on AI-generated content and explore how AI can be used to create high-quality, relevant, and authoritative content that ranks well on Google.Google's Approach to AI-Generated Content\u200bGoogle's focus has always been on rewarding high-quality, original content that demonstrates expertise, authoritativeness, experience and trustworthiness (E-A-T). Google has been consistent in its stance on automated and AI-generated content, stating that using AI to manipulate search results is a violation of its spam policy. However, Google has emphasized that not all automated or AI-generated content is considered spam. It can also be used to generate helpful content, such as sports scores, weather forecasts and transcripts.Google has long been committed to providing reliable, high-quality results to its users, and its ranking systems are designed to display information that meets its quality guidelines, regardless of how it was created. Google's systems aim to display content that complies with E-A-T principles and provide users with the most relevant and meaningful results. Therefore, using AI to create content that meets these principles can be beneficial to rankings.Factors That Determine the Ranking of AI-Generated ContentWhen it comes to ranking AI-generated content, the same factors that determine the ranking of other content apply. Google's algorithms analyze hundreds of ranking factors, including the relevance of the content to the user's search query, the quality of the content, the backlinks pointing to the content, and the authority of the website.AI-generated content can be useful in creating high-quality content that meets these ranking factors. For example, you can use AI tools like ChatGPT for SEO to identify hot topics and create unique, informative, and engaging content on those topics.If this content meets Google's quality guidelines, then it has the potential to rank well on Google.Advantages of AI-Generated ContentUsing AI to generate content has several advantages.&nbsp;First, AI-generated content can help improve the efficiency and speed of content creation. AI can automate content creation, saving time and resources while producing high-quality content.Second, AI can create content in multiple formats, including text, images, audio, and video. This means that companies can create content in different formats to meet the needs of their target audience, which can lead to better engagement and wider distribution.Discover how you can optimize your images SEO using AI and machine learning.&nbsp;Third, AI-generated content can be personalized to meet the needs and preferences of individual users. This can help improve content relevance and engagement, leading to higher rankings on Google.Challenges of AI-Generated ContentDespite the benefits of using AI to generate content, there are also some challenges that businesses should be aware of. One of the biggest challenges is the risk of producing low-quality or spammy content. If AI-generated content is created solely for the purpose of manipulating search results, it can lead to Google penalizing the site and damaging its reputation.Second, AI-generated content can lack the human touch and creativity that readers appreciate. AI-generated content can be informative and relevant, but it does not always have the emotional appeal and storytelling that human-generated content does.The key to using AI to create original, high-quality content is to develop a sophisticated workflow where the work of the editorial team is supported and implemented by the use of AI, not replaced. Only when humans and machines work together will the result be appreciated by search engines and users.In WordLift, we have developed a sophisticated approach to AI-generated content, moving from initial data collection and enrichment to active learning, where the model is improved and the validation pipeline is also improved. You can find out more about our workflow by watching this webinar \ud83d\udc47https://youtu.be/CIaGR6d2nR8ConclusionIn summary, AI-generated content can rank on Google as long as it meets Google's quality guidelines and complies with the E-A-T principles. Companies that want to use AI-generated content should focus on creating original, high-quality, and relevant content that meets the needs and preferences of their target audience. They should also avoid using AI-generated content to manipulate search results and ensure that content is personalized, engaging, and informative.AI-generated content is a powerful tool that can help companies improve their content creation process and deliver high-quality, relevant content to their target audience. However, companies need to be aware of the challenges associated with AI-generated content and ensure they are using it responsibly and ethically.In conclusion, the use of AI-generated content does not violate Google's guidelines, provided it complies with quality guidelines and E-A-T principles. With the right strategy, AI-generated content can be an effective tool for companies to create high-quality content that ranks well on Google and adds value to their target audience.[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "Structured Data For Shopify: How To Increase Your Sales By Building A Product Knowledge Graph Table of content: The difference between schema markup warnings and errorsWhy is schema markup important for an e-commerce website?OK, then, how can I properly install structured data on my Shopify store?Okay, I'm interested, how to obtain the PKG builder for WordLift to install structured data to my Shopify store?In a report compiled by Wall Street Zen, it was revealed that the year 2020 witnessed a staggering surge in Shopify's reach, with a remarkable 457 million individuals engaging in transactions with sellers on this dynamic platform. This figure soared exponentially from the previous year's 300 million, showcasing the immense popularity and trust that Shopify has garnered worldwide.Delving deeper into the astonishing numbers, we discover that nearly 11,000 checkouts transpire every minute across the vast Shopify ecosystem. This real-time manifestation of commerce highlights the platform's seamless functionality, empowering businesses to seamlessly cater to the ever-evolving needs of their customers.What sets Shopify apart from its competitors is not only its exponential growth but also its exceptional performance in comparison to industry standards. In 2019, businesses established on Shopify experienced a remarkable 50% growth rate, surpassing the industry's average of 21% for that year. This exceptional achievement solidifies Shopify's position as a catalyst for success, providing entrepreneurs with the tools and resources they need to thrive in the fiercely competitive online marketplace.At Wordlift, we work extensively with structured data and schema markup. SEO professionals and e-commerce owners are keen to leverage the latest trends in schema markups to maximize their online presence and improve website conversions. Today, we'll discuss the most common mistakes made when adding structured data to Shopify stores, as well as the best practices you can adopt to improve your online presence. Let's get started!The Difference Between Schema Markup Warnings And ErrorsThere are two types of feedback that you can get from Google's SEO tools:WarningsErrorsDepending on what is displayed on your site, when you try to add structured data to your Shopify store, Google treats it differently. Warnings are less severe than errors and do not directly impact your search engine optimization. Even if they appear, Google can still understand the meaning of your content or structured data by analyzing and processing the encapsulated data. Nowadays, warnings are treated more as suggestions or additional steps you can take to perfectly optimize your structured data in Shopify.If, on the other hand, you are struggling with errors, you should be really concerned about your SEO performance and proactively take further steps to fix it. And why? When you have an error, Google marks the entire structured data field as unusable and not working. Errors do not affect other elements on the page. For example, if you have two different product records, one of which has an error and the other is correct, the latter will still work properly. In summary, as long as there is at least one set of error-free data, Googles processing algorithm is satisfied.Source: StructuredSEO.comWe definitely advise you to fix your errors in the structured data, because they can seriously affect your SEO if done incorrectly. This means that your pages can be excluded from Google index if you do not do your schema markup correctly. This is a serious matter and should not be neglected!Why Is Schema Markup Important For An E-Commerce Website?Whether you' are a small business owner or run a large e-commerce website, installing schema markup on your website can be quite a tedious process, especially if you need to remove certain structured data (such as microdata) beforehand. This task requires appropriate technical expertise to navigate your web system and fix any technical issues that may arise.Unstructured data, such as plain text, is difficult for search engines to process. For our part, we need a little more help, and that's where structured data comes in handy. Structured data (also known as schema markup) helps search engines better understand our content.Ok, Then, How Can I Properly Install Structured Data On My Shopify Store?Shopify theme creators often include schema.org markup with their template files. However, the schema markup is usually in need of improvement, as we' have observed Shopify creators creating duplicates in their Structured Data Reports and Structured Data Testing tools.Obviously, you do not want that for your own website. In an ideal world, your schema markup should be added in such a way that it is intuitive for the person editing it and does not require technical knowledge as a developer.Even if you have developer support, the problem with this approach is that it does not really scale: you solve the problem once, but you do not leverage the concentrated power of your structured data in your Google Merchant Center, nor do you solve your complementary SEO problems this way. We need to improve the process by adding a new tool to the process. Sounds too good to be true? Well, we' have the right thing for you!With just a few simple steps, you can use our Product Knowledge Graph Builder to add structured data for your Shopify e-commerce, optimizing your Merchant Feed. Our product is designed for non-developers, which means we can help you add schema markup to your products and simplify it for you.And it is not just about that - it is about harnessing the full power of the PKG Builder itself. With it, you can enrich your product data by connecting your Google Merchant Center data feed with the appropriate schema markups that are specific to your e-commerce store. That's the real value we offer - the ability to work with Product Knowledge Graph Builder and take advantage of all its benefits. This means that you are not only investing in installing schema markup, but also in improving your SEO performance through AI-generated product descriptions and other AI-driven workflows. This is the complete solution you have been looking for, is not it great?Now you just need to focus on solving SEO problems - you do not need to hire developers to work on them for you, and you do not need to spend time in coordination meetings to ensure a shared vision. The tool does it for you - you have everything in one place, right under your finger!As an SEO professional and e-commerce owner, its important that you develop the right key performance indicators (KPIs) to track your e-commerce SEO progress. Some of these can be rich snippets, enhanced product data, improved targeting and increased visibility, which can be achieved with WordLift Product Knowledge (PKG) Builder.How to use the PKG BuilderUsing the Product Knowledge Graph Builder is simple. The first step of the process is to sign in with your Google account for authentication, which is easy to do. In the next step, Google will ask you for permission for the app to access your Google account. Here, you just need to click the \"Allow\" button.Once you' have logged into the platform, you can fill in the field for your seller name and select your e-commerce store. In the next step, just click on the \"Next\" button and the automatic configuration process will start for you. During the configuration process, you can also avail live support to make sure that everything is as easy as possible for you.The last step is to initiate the synchronization process. You will then receive a status message about the progress in your e-commerce store account.

Once you purchase the plan, you will receive a WordLift Key. With this key you can access the dashboard where you can add your feeds and use the PKG Builder.[et_pb_section global_module=\"20965\"][/et_pb_section]More Frequently Asked Questions\u200b\u200bDoes Shopify Have Structured Data?Absolutely Shopify uses structured data to better explain products: their price, description, availability, and more, to visually display them on search engine results pages (SERPs). However, this is not an official part of Shopify, but has more to do with the template you use.Shopify integrates structured data for various content types, including blog posts and reviews, so that search engines can capture the context and meaning of the content. Using structured data can improve the visibility and ranking of the Shopify' website in search results, which leads to more traffic and sales in the long run.How Do I Add Structured Data To My Shopify Website?There are several ways to add structured data to your Shopify store. You can do this using Shopify apps from the Shopify app store (paid), custom development by inserting a JavaScript tag into your backend code, Google Tag Manager, or third-party apps like WordLift PKG builder and SchemaApp across various product offerings and business plans. What Types Of Structured Data Can Be Used On A Shopify Store?The most popular structured data types in Shopify e-commerce stores are Product structured data, Organization schema, Breadcrumb schema, Article schema, and Review schema.Can Structured Data Improve The User Experience For Customers On A Shopify Store?Structured data can improve the user experience for customers in a Shopify store in several ways. First, it can improve the presentation of search results by providing information such as product ratings, reviews, and prices that can help customers make an informed decision. Second, it can make it easier for customers to navigate and find information by providing information about the site's structure, such as breadcrumb trails. Finally, structured data can increase the credibility and trustworthiness of the website by providing data about the company, such as address, phone number, and social media profiles.[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "Taxonomy SEO, knowledge graph, and ChatGPT go hand in hand. Here's why. Table of contents:Where Does ChatGPT Excel?What Is A Taxonomy SEO And How Is This Related To ChatGPT?How Can I Achieve The Perfect Taxonomy By Using ChatGPT?Ok, How To Connect ChatGPT To My Specific Data?ChatGPT changed the world by storm. We've already covered some aspects of it in our previous WordLift articles. Still, we feel the responsibility to step up and explain what this means for the SEO community, website owners, and webmasters in general. Aleyda Solis, one of the most famous SEO professionals, had a brilliant Twitter thread addressing the concerns that SEO marketers can be easily replaced by these AI tools.https://twitter.com/aleyda/status/1641419467900035072If you were wondering the same, you are not alone in feeling stressed, intrigued, or concerned about the latest AI developments. We performed extensive research, analysis, and discussions in the community and with our clients to prove to you that this won't be the case for us as a profession and for you as an SEO specialist because great customer experiences are complex and require much more effort than just simple prompting.Where Does ChatGPT Excel?ChatGPT is great for automation - it can be your great sparring partner in coding, rewriting, content implementation, topic research, and much more. It can surely be very useful when you need a second hand to help you and all of that for free or at a relatively low cost if you are using the paid plan. While ChatGPT has a lot of advantages and it's a very trendy topic right now, it has its own shortcomings that go beyond known disadvantages, like hallucination, misinformation, and copyright problems.What Is A Taxonomy SEO And How Is This Related To ChatGPT?A website taxonomy or taxonomy SEO is a concept that reveals a hierarchical structure that helps organize and categorize the content of a website. It is used to guide visitors to the information they are looking for and helps search engines better understand the content of the website. When we talk about website taxonomy, we usually think about improving a website's navigation, usability and search engine ranking.Now, creating taxonomy SEO it's not a simple process. It requires content analysis, data analysis skills, and the right SEO skills to determine the main topics and subtopics for a website. You can use first-party tools to get more data, such as Google Search Console, Google Analytics or log file data to define your most popular pages, keywords and traffic sources.Once you obtain the list of topics and categories, you can start organizing them into a hierarchical structure. The top-level categories should always be broad and general, while the rest of the information tree should get more and more specific and targeted.&nbsp; For example, if you're creating a website for a travel agency, the top-level categories might be \"Destinations,\" \"Travel Packages,\" and \"Travel Tips,\" while the subcategories might be \"Europe,\" \"Asia,\" \"Adventure Tours,\" \"Beach Vacations,\" and \"Packing Tips.\"This requires serious SEO and data analysis skills, as the categories should be intuitive and logical, while the subcategories should be consistent and easy to navigate. This is something that ChatGPT, as a standalone tool, cannot automate for you: You need to do the analysis, use your SEO savvy, and combine these cross-functional skills to find the best solution for your website or client. The most important pages should be accessible in a few clicks, and the taxonomy should provide a clear path to relevant content.Once you have created the taxonomy, you can implement it on the website by updating the navigation menu, creating category pages and optimizing the website content. You should also ensure that the site's URL structure reflects the taxonomy and that page titles and meta descriptions are optimized for relevant keywords. In other words, design your site's structure so that it's easy for users to understand.How Can I Achieve The Perfect Taxonomy By Using ChatGPT?We are glad you asked. This is where knowledge graphs come in. By developing your knowledge graph and ideally merging that data with other data sources, you can intelligently identify the most valuable money-making websites for your online business, whether it's an e-commerce store or a simpler business website. Knowledge graphs are perfect for helping you build the right URL structure that meets your users' expectations and gives them, as well as the search engines, the right topical authority. It's about search optimization, not just search engine optimization anymore.If you use a knowledge graph to build your website taxonomy, you can create a smarter and more effective categorization system. You can use the knowledge graph to identify and classify entities and concepts, and then link them together in a meaningful way. This creates a more structured and organized taxonomy that makes it easier for search engines to understand your website's content.Ok, How To Connect ChatGPT To My Specific Data?Plugins are tools designed specifically for language models with safety as a core principle. They help ChatGPT access up-to-date information, run computations, and eventually, use third-party services if needed. This is of vital importance: you want reliable, correct, and healthy data that you can feed into whatever system (in&nbsp; this case ChatGPT) so that you can build new apps and intelligent next-gen customer experiences on top of it.ChatGPT alone will make a lot of mistakes if it's not connected through a plugin with external data that might be crucial for you to help users convert. Given that it is not super safe to just let sensitive data to ChatGPT, it will be better if you can create a proxy in this case, this is the plugin that works with the ChatGPT API, that will communicate with external data to provide the answers that your potential customers are looking to obtain. In simple words, we can mitigate these risks by feeding data into ChatGPT-alike LLMs and by leveraging their emerging abilities.To clarify, the OpenAI's ChatGPT application uses any input data to train future models which is a significant security risk, while the ChatGPT API does not, as explicitly stated by its data usage policy.Harness the superpowers of plugins and knowledge graphs - excel where ChatGPT fails as a single standalone tool, but works in combination as a powerful combo.Here's one example of how you can achieve that. We have been experimenting with building chatbots on the top of an e-commerce knowledge graph and ChatGPT technology for a client of ours in the e-commerce space. What you've always wanted is finally here:A quality backend technology that connects your data by combining multiple touchpoints (the knowledge graph).A quality conversational interface that is utilizing the power of this backend to hold meaningful conversations with your potential customers, leading them from onboarding to the buying phase. See the screenshots below.A quality backend dataA quality conversational AI - chatbotLearn how to build a chatbot using your Knowledge Graph. WordLift acts and will continue to act responsibly in helping organizations like yours formalize knowledge by defining rules like ontologies and knowledge graphs to help you outperform your competitors in the online space.In summary, is it better if you have a taxonomy? Absolutely yes! But that alone will not make much difference unless it's combined with your knowledge graph. You need to invest time in building both, because this is the most robust and future-proof strategy you can develop for your online business or e-commerce store. Combine this with the power of big language models like ChatGPT and voila, you have the magic wand to do whatever you want: Create conversational agents based on your personalized data, build recommendation systems to recommend products, or support your sales team with an automated solution that can act like customer support. The possibilities are huge!Are you ready to start with us today? Let's talk  \ud83d\ude0eOther Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat Is A Taxonomy In SEO?&nbsp;In SEO, taxonomy refers to the way information is organized and categorized on a website to make it easily understandable to both search engines and users.Taxonomy is often used to create a hierarchical structure of categories and subcategories that are used to organize content on a website. As a content creator,&nbsp; the purpose of your creating a taxonomy SEO is to make your content navigable, logical, and intuitive. By creating a logical and organized taxonomy, your website can improve its user experience and gain potential search engine rankings.Does Taxonomy Help With SEO?A website can improve its visibility in search results and make it easier for users to find the content they are looking for by using clear and descriptive categories and subcategories. Additionally, a well-designed taxonomy can help with internal linking and site navigation, which are both important factors for both SEO and user experience.What Is A Knowledge Graph In SEO?In SEO, a knowledge graph is a method of organizing and linking information to help search engines better understand the connections between different entities and concepts.For instance, if a user searches for \"Leonardo da Vinci,\" a knowledge graph may display a box containing a brief bio, pictures, and other pertinent details about the artist. This information is sourced from a range of reliable sources, including structured data markup on websites. By providing a knowledge graph, search engines can offer valuable insights into the most relevant information for users, which can inform content creation and optimization strategies.[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

Originally taxonomy referred only to the classifying of organisms or a particular classification of organisms. In a wider, more general sense, it may refer to a classification of things or concepts, as well as to the principles underlying such a classification.

        "text": "8 Content Marketing Strategies to Boost Sales and Stay on Top of the Competition It's hard to get your content noticed with so much going on in the world. Without a strong content marketing strategy, it's nearly impossible. Almost every major brand is generating content across multiple platforms. Every. Single.

Their website even sports a free ROI calculator to see how much time and money you\u2019ll save by using their tool!image sourceInclude High-Quality VideoOne of the best ways to increase engagement is by using video. Video works whether it's a short clip on TikTok or a 30-second spot on network television. It's a great way to get a niche business in front of potential customers.&nbsp;But don't sleep on the power of a solid video pitch. Check out this video by TSplus describing how their remote support software works.&nbsp;Your content marketing shouldn\u2019t be all fluff. You can also help customers learn about the advantages of your product over the competition. Providing valuable information to people considering a purchase should also be part of your marketing strategy.Emphasize Free DeliveryCustomers love fast, free shipping. That's especially true when customers are worried about their purchases arriving on time. According to a recent study, 73% of consumers are more likely to buy things online if shipping is free. That statistic should encourage you to consider implementing free delivery in your content marketing plan.&nbsp;But don't make a promise you can't keep. Instead, consider partnering with a local same-day delivery courier service to guarantee you can follow through. In fact, you might even highlight that partnership as part of your content marketing to give the promise more credibility.image sourceStay In The Know With Business AnalyticsNo strategy is complete without a way to measure its success. Part of your marketing strategy must evaluate what's working and what's not. Make sure you know how to use your website traffic monitoring tools before getting too far down the road. It's probably also a good idea to do some A/B testing or at least keep track of which ads are getting engagement. If you want to really dig into the business analytics side of things, check out a digital report builder. These powerful software packages can provide a ton of strategic insights at the click of a button.Give Something AwayWhatever you're selling, from vitamins to virtual assistant services, you're competing for attention. One bold strategy to consider is to give something away. Seeing the word \"free\" tends to grab people's attention. You can use that to your advantage.If you're on a small budget, your prize could be what you sell. But, to get more impact, consider using a raffle or sweepstakes rather than a simple free product or trial. That way, you only have to give away a limited amount of product while still offering the chance to get something for nothing to a wide audience.&nbsp;The prize could be a fancy dinner at a local high-end restaurant. Or, if your budget allows, you can even give away a trip to an event in Tulum, Mexico, to generate some buzz. Develop a content marketing strategy around whatever prize you want to give away. That strategy might just be enough to get the customer's attention and direct them to your website.Conclusion Content marketing is a critical step for any business. The challenge is getting noticed among the thousands of marketing efforts overlapping your own. The content marketing strategies offered here should give you a better chance at breaking through the noise, boosting sales, and staying on top of the competition.&nbsp;[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

A well-designed website cannot do the magic on its own. It is only the first step: you need to account for your website being easily discoverable across online spaces and appealing to both customers and search engines. There are many ways to achieve this but not all of them are super powerful like the process of adding a schema markup to your Magento website.Schema markup has been here with us for some time already. We have seen a lot of case studies about it, spoken about structured data at online conferences, and witnessed it powering websites' visibility in search engine results, enhancing their performance through rich snippets and other snippet features.Why not give your Magento website a competitive edge? You can architect your organic efforts and develop your website \u201creal estate\u201d on SERPs to boost conversions. In this article, I will explain how you can do so carefully, so that you can take your online presence to the next level!How To Add Structured Data Magento To My Website Effortlessly?\u00a0There are different ways to add structured data to your Magento website but it might be difficult for you to do so if you do not come from an IT background. You will need to deal with the nitty-gritty IT details that are sometimes hard to grasp or you will need to collaborate (and sometimes really bother!) with your developers to help you out in the process. The truth is, SEO tasks rarely get prioritized by the tech team, so the easiest and the most efficient method will be to use a third-party extension or a tool.\u00a0There are several good extensions that can do the work for you because they are specifically designed to help you add schema markup to your Magento website. The idea is to complete the process as painlessly as possible without too much time (and nerves!) being wasted. The good thing about these plugin extensions is that they will support you in the process of adding structured data for different elements on your website, like adding products, reviews, contact information, and opening hours schema markup schema. Afterward, you can automatically apply them to your website pages.Google Tag ManagerThe first option that you can try using is Google Tag Manager. It often comes in handy when you do not have direct access to your website or your developers that could do that for you. With Google Tag Manager, the process is easily streamlined and achievable in just a few steps. Here is what you need to put in place:Create a Google Tag Manager account: if you do not own any at the current moment, you can create your profile for free on tagmanager.google.com;Add the Google Tag Manager code to your Magento website, either to your site\u2019s header or footer or by using a Magento extension for them. We promised that we would not involve any coding, but this is the very first time that you need to do this and once the GTM code is in place, you will be ready to go in the future!;Create a new tag: this can be done in your GTM account where you choose the configuration, then \u201cCustom HTML\u201d as the tag type, and then paste your schema markup code;Define the trigger: there needs to be something, like an event listener that will activate your schema markup tag. For example, if you add schema markup for a product, that means that you would like to trigger the tag on a product page. Simple as that.Preview and publish: the tag and the trigger are created, now it is time to preview your changes in Google Tag Manager\u2019s Preview mode. If everything seems OK, continue with publishing your changes.Test your schema markup: the final step will be to ensure that the schema markup (and your tags and triggers obviously) is working correctly. You can use the Google Structured Data Testing tool as the more reliable tool to check your schema markup implementation and ensure that all the right web, schema markup elements are in place.&nbsp;\u00a0SchemaAppThis tool will help you add schema markup to your Magento website in just a few clicks. It also provides a visual interface for defining JSON-LD elements for different sections on your site. This makes the whole process easier and completely doable for someone without experience with coding or web development in general.The process is fairly similar to the one described above for Google Tag Manager, the only difference is that GTM is free while this one is around $1500 a month.WordLiftThe Data API integration allows for greater performance and reliability of JSON-LD structured data. The way it works is quite simple, even though it takes some more steps than a simple WordPress plugin (and it can work with e-commerce websites that are Magento, BigCommerce, or Shopify-based).

Can you provide a guided explanation for a digital experience professional like me?Is the Google Carousel available on all devices?How do I optimize my content for the Google Carousel? How do I rank in Google's carousel?OK, then how to optimize my entities? How to do proper entity building?Can you show me some practical examples of Google Carousel SEO?Wrapping up the Google Carousel SEOOur work as SEOs has never been simple in the last 5 years. BERT, MUM, algorithm updates and now GPT-alike models are everywhere around us. The key is to find a way to ensure leverage, especially at scale because scaling site-wide changes make the whole difference in the online business world. This is where Google Carousel SEO comes into play!&nbsp;Carousels are becoming more and more prominent on Google Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs), so buckle up, my friend, because I'm about to blow your mind with some seriously entertaining and informative SEO goodness!What is Google Carousel SEO? Can you provide a guided explanation for a digital experience professional like me?The term \"Google Carousel SEO\" encompasses various features and elements within Google's search results. Let's explore a couple of possibilities. Knowledge Graph CarouselThe Knowledge Graph Carousel, an attribute within Google's search results, showcases a horizontal row of images associated with a specific search query. It frequently manifests for searches pertaining to individuals, locations, films, books, and other notable entities. Each image in the carousel represents a distinct item, and selecting an image typically leads to further information about that specific item. Simply explained, the Knowledge graph carousel aims to provide visual representations of the search query and often includes images that are relevant to the entity being searched. For instance, if you search for a famous actor, the Knowledge Graph Carousel may showcase images of that actor. Here's what the knowledge graph carousel looks like - the WordLift part on the right:Image CarouselIn addition, Google offers an image search function that incorporates an image carousel. Upon conducting an image search, the outcomes can be presented in a horizontally scrollable carousel format, allowing seamless perusal of multiple images without exiting the search results page. This carousel layout offers a swift preview of diverse images related to your search query, but also photographs, illustrations, graphics, and other visual media. Here's what the Google Image Carousel looks like (movies icons below):It's worth noting that Google regularly updates its search features; hence, the specific appearance and functionality of the Google Carousel have evolved over the years.We at WordLift have been devoted to the science and the craft of building next-generation search and user experiences. We've learned from the latest Google updates on the Google I/O 2023 conference that we are entering the era of entity-driven interactive panels through&nbsp;generative AI capabilities. Knowledge and image panels can even be combined together, accompanied by other web elements, such as&nbsp;content summarization, question refinements, and topic exploration. The new UI reflects an understanding of the ever-evolving user needs and SEO strategies that need to adapt to the user.The definite way to achieve this is by implementing entities, especially for large language models (LLMs) - they have entities at their core, and their presence is their key incentive to understand user requests and perform generative AI tasks.It is a turning point for all of us in digital marketing - what we get served is no longer a simple search engine result page. It represents a user-focused \"search engine results experience&nbsp;(SERE), threaded across platforms.\"Is the Google Carousel available on all devices?The availability of the Google Carousel SEO can vary depending on the device and the specific feature you're referring to. Let's delve into some general considerations:Knowledge Graph Carousel: The Knowledge Graph Carousel is typically accessible on both desktop and mobile devices. However, its appearance and functionality may vary depending on the screen size and capabilities of the device. On mobile devices, the carousel often appears as a horizontally scrollable row of images, allowing users to swipe through them. On desktop devices, it may be presented as a row of images, enabling users to click or scroll through using arrow buttons. Let's visualize that a bit:Source: How to Get A Google Knowledge Graph Panel for Your Brand?Image Carousel: The image carousel within Google's image search results is usually accessible on a wide range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. It's meticulously designed to provide an optimized browsing experience across various screen sizes. Users can effortlessly swipe or utilize navigation buttons to scroll through the images within the carousel. The same applies to products. Let's take a look:Source: State of Search 2022: Google's Changes and Trends to Know NowAlthough Google strives to maintain consistent features across devices, certain variations may arise due to factors like device compatibility, screen size, and browser settings.How do I optimize my content for the Google Carousel? How do I rank in Google's carousel?Optimizing your content for the Google Carousel involves a combination of SEO best practices and structuring your content in a way that increases its chances of being featured. That is why we simply call it Google Carousel SEO. While Google's algorithm criteria aren't publicly disclosed, here are some general tips to improve your chances:Use high-quality images: Ensure that the images you include are visually appealing, relevant, and of high quality. High-resolution images with appropriate alt text have a better chance of being selected for the carousel. That's also great for accessibility, especially if you have an e-commerce website - carousels are considered to be a scalable SEO strategy;Implement schema markup: Use structured data markup, specifically schema.org JSON-LD markup to provide explicit information about your content. This helps search engines understand the context and relevance of your unstructured data such as text and images, thus increasing the likelihood of being featured;Optimize your web pages: Focus on relevant keywords and provide concise, descriptive titles, meta descriptions, and headers. Clear and well-structured content helps search engines understand the purpose and relevance of your page;Create a knowledge graph: Explain your entities and form entity relationships through entity linking and linked-data principles. You need to work on building and enriching your entity definitions first and curating your knowledge graph second.Create valuable and engaging content: Develop content that is informative, valuable, and engaging for your audience. Unique and compelling content has a higher chance of being featured in search features, including the carousel;Prioritize user experience and mobile-friendliness: Ensure your website is mobile-friendly and provides a seamless user experience across devices. Google favors content that is easily accessible and user-friendly on mobile devices. User experience will always come first, no matter whether Google sunsets its mobile-friendliness tools or not;Encourage social sharing and backlinks: Promote social sharing of your content and strive to earn high-quality backlinks from authoritative websites. Increased visibility and credibility can positively impact your chances of being featured.Keep in mind that Google's algorithms and search features are constantly evolving, and there's no guaranteed method for inclusion in the Google Carousel. However, following these best practices can help optimize your content for improved visibility and increase the likelihood of being featured in search results, including the carousel.Ok, Then How To Optimize My Entities? How To Do Proper Entity Building?Entity salience and salience score are the most advanced entity-based SEO strategies to maintain your entity resilience framework. Entity salience is how often your entity appears throughout the content while salience score refers to the relevance that this entity has to the main topic of the content that you're writing.&nbsp;Let's visualize that for a second. The word salience on the following picture refers to the salience score and the determined salience value for the entity Google is 0.19 (maximal salience compared to the salience score of the rest of the named entities found in the piece of content provided below):There is an educated way to approach the entity-building process:You can summarize your content by using automation through machine learning (BERT summarizer let's say or GPT-alike model summarization)You can calculate the salience score by using the spaCy similarity function which uses cosine similarity to obtain the relevance score for a particular word compared to a summary (a few sentences).In WordLift, we analyze the content by taking the URL (or URLs) of your content, analyzing the\u00a0 content that is present there, finding all the entities, and their respective entity annotations, and finally mapping them in one schema markup package, including the images you might have on your side in the content. We not only provide salience inside a text, but we also let you hook entity extraction with entities from your local knowledge graph. By doing this, we are actually providing not only an entity-building tool but also a feedback system for you on what you're \"covering\" with your content, but also what's \"missing\", entity-wise.\u00a0These are the 3 important features that you were missing in your content analysis process:A tool to help you automate the process of finding entities, their annotations, and doing entity linking;An entity salience score that explains the entity relevance in the content;A simple, but straightforward feedback system on what's inside your content and what entities are still missing from your content writing (or are irrelevant, so you need rewriting).Can You Show Me Some Practical Examples Of Google Carousel SEO?Yes, sure, we're excited that you asked! We can use the entity Andrea Volpini as a primer - his name appears when you search for \u201cBest SEO expert in the world\u201d, while some important experts are missing (such as Lily Ray or Cindy Krum).&nbsp;The reason for this is that Andrea\u2019s entity is information-rich and cross-linked to other important entities like Sebastian Schaffert or RedLink (ex-business partner and company). By using entity enrichment optimization through knowledge graph implementation, Google matches all the necessary details with the entity Andrea and displays him in the carousel \u201cBest of\u201d.&nbsp;He invested time to optimize his entity over time and as a result, he can harvest his organic SEO earnings now (see images below). The way to achieve the same for you is to invest in entity building by implementing a knowledge graph on your website and writing entity-friendly SEO articles, rich in information about the entity of interest (in the case of Andrea, where he comes from, what's his background, what are his contributions to the community, which entities he's related to and so on). Wrapping up the Google Carousel SEOTo sum up, the benefits of optimizing your content for the Google SEO Carousel are the following:Eye-Catching Visual Feast: The Google carousel is a visual spectacle, showcasing images that instantly grab attention. It's like a virtual carnival of vibrant visuals, luring searchers to click on those juicy carousel results. By optimizing your website to appear in the carousel, you're giving your brand a chance to shine like a dazzling disco ball!;Maximum Real Estate Domination: Forget about mere mortals who only get one search result listing. When your website lands a spot in the Google carousel, it's like winning the SEO lottery! Your site gets to occupy valuable real estate at the very top of the search results, hogging the limelight and stealing the show. Talk about making a grand entrance!;Credibility Boost: Picture this - you're at a party, and two groups of people are talking about the same topic. One group is casually chatting, while the other is passionately discussing it with megaphones. Which one do you think people will gravitate towards? Ding, ding, ding! The megaphone gang, of course! Being featured in the Google carousel is like wielding a virtual megaphone, shouting to the world, \"Hey, we're important!\" It instantly enhances your credibility and positions you as a top dog in your niche;Traffic Extravaganza: Now, my friend, here's the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance. The Google carousel is a traffic magnet. When your website is lucky enough to appear in this visually captivating showcase, prepare yourself for an influx of eager clickers. It's like having a flashy neon sign that says, \"Come hither, my lovely visitors, and behold the wonders of my website!\" More clicks mean more traffic, which means more potential conversions and sweet success.Finally, optimizing your website for the Google Carousel is a no-brainer. It's like a ticket to the SEO VIP lounge, where you can show off your brand, boost your credibility, and attract hordes of enthusiastic visitors. So get ready to dazzle the search results stage, my friend, because the Google carousel is waiting to give your website the spotlight it deserves![et_pb_section global_module=\"20980\"][/et_pb_section][wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

To achieve this goal, Hacker SEO Agency provides high-quality services that seamlessly integrate with the client's website, branding, and goals, boosting rankings, traffic, leads, and conversions.They chose to use WordLift for Hanabishi, a client who has an e-commerce website, which is well known locally and is currently part of a very competitive online industry. In this&nbsp;SEO case study, Sean Si - CEO at SEO Hacker Agency - tell us&nbsp;how the team increased the organic traffic&nbsp;to the e-commerce by using WordLift and which results they achieved. WordLift has exceeded our expectations, and we're thrilled to both continue exploring its many functions for ecommerce, and to recommend it to fellow businesses and SEOs in search of a means to improve content, user experience, and ultimately, your website's performance.Sean Si - CEO at SEO Hacker AgencyWhich client did you choose for Wordlift and why?We chose our client Hanabishi, as it is an ecommerce website, well-known locally, and is currently part of a very competitive online industry.&nbsp;Hanabishi is one of the leading home appliances brands in the Philippines, and are considered a staple for their affordable yet reliable and durable quality. Originally known for their small appliances, they have expanded their line to include a wide variety of home, kitchen, and office appliances.&nbsp;Despite their popularity offline, their online presence needed work. This company, as our client, sought to establish themselves just as firmly online, cater to an increasingly digital generation of buyers, and, of course, stay ahead of the competition.We have worked with them for some time with a holistic approach to their e-commerce SEO, and have successfully drawn in more traffic and improved their position within the search engine results pages (SERPs).&nbsp;The dilemma, however, was this: Hanabishi still needed more to rank for more competitive keywords, and improve their position\u2013especially given recent Google algorithm updates.Using WordLift to help our clientAs an affiliate partner, we have previously used Wordlift for our own website in the past, and have seen how the plugin\u2013with its ability to seamlessly apply an additional layer of metadata to content\u2013can vastly improve visibility on Google's search results pages.Given that, we decided to apply Wordlift to our client\u2019s website, in hopes that applying the same Schema markups could produce similar results and help with the client\u2019s dilemma.&nbsp;In addition, we knew that Wordlift had come up with new functionalities geared towards ecommerce sites\u2013and the opportunity seemed perfect for us. With the plugin and the Product Knowledge Graph, we could easily provide the digital infrastructure needed to help Google truly understand the client\u2019s products and content.&nbsp;You can list your products in Google Shopping for free. Find out how in our web story about&nbsp;Google Shopping Graph.ResultsBy applying the appropriate markups, identifying content gaps, and connecting commercial and editorial content, we could increase visibility, and ergo draw in the traffic the client wanted.&nbsp;And applying it to Hanabishi\u2019s websites garnered almost instant results. We saw an immediate increase in traffic the day it was installed on their website. Though the biggest increase was within the first week (which had double our usual traffic for the day), we did observe a consistent improvement throughout the last few weeks\u2013resulting in a 26.8% increase in organic traffic overall.E-commerce organic traffic grows after experiencing a decrease in visits.Similarly, we saw the metrics for the website\u2019s impressions increase by 29.5%.The growth of e-commerce impressions after starting to use WordLift.Other metrics\u2013particularly engaged sessions\u2013also saw improvement, increasing by 28.4%. Engagement is increasing. It also helped our keywords regain their position in the top 10 results. Furthermore, these keywords are more stable in their rankings now, compared to before using Wordlift, as you can see the differences below in the month of March 2023, versus June 2022 to February 2022.On our team\u2019s end, we found the tool incredibly convenient and time-saving, as we did not need to do most of the legwork when it came to constructing and applying the structured data we needed\u2013Wordlift simply applied it for us.&nbsp;We are also glad that we didn\u2019t face any challenges. After the installation of Wordlift, we\u2019ve seen spikes and consistent results in our traffic for this client.

        "text": "The Power Of Knowledge Graphs In Modern SEO: Helping The Editorial Industry Optimize Content For The New Search [KGC 23 - Presentation] With the rapid rise of generative AI, the landscape for digital publishers and SEO professionals has undergone a profound transformation. Our work, goals, and objectives have evolved in response to these changes.&nbsp;Search engines have become stricter in defining quality criteria as online content grows. Therefore, it is crucial for digital publishers, now more than ever, to establish authority and maintain a consistent level of quality.Look at Beatrice Gamba's presentation at the Knowledge Graph Conference 2023 -&nbsp;The Power of Knowledge Graphs in Modern SEO&nbsp;Facing the Content Tsunami of AI-Written ContentThe role of SEO experts has adapted to state-of-the-art technologies to help clients achieve online visibility.&nbsp;Until now, my job as an SEO expert has been to enable digital businesses to achieve good visibility and build an excellent online reputation for their websites.Research by Ahrefs on 920 mln websites states that 91% of online content has no traffic on Google. We expect this number to grow with the rise of generative AI tools, especially for low-quality content that human editors haven't reviewed.But what about optimization for AI\u2026To answer this, I asked for guidance directly from Bing Chat.I attended SMX Munich in March, and Fabrice Canel, during his keynote, gave some advice to SEOs about optimization for the new search experience.&nbsp;The essential advice was to focus on quality content and semantic markup.I went on asking what semantic markup is:&nbsp;And it was no surprise to find a mention of WordLift since we have embraced this approach since forever: delivering high-quality content enriched with semantic markup to meet user needs.Securing the Value of Digital Content in the Era of AIOne of the critical challenges for content producers in today's fast-paced industry is to demonstrate expertise and credibility.&nbsp;In this context, Knowledge graphs play a vital role in securing and validating the authenticity of online content.&nbsp;With the abundance of online information, users (and search engines) have become more cautious about the credibility and accuracy of the content they consume and propose.&nbsp; Structured data can help build trust within the target audience by demonstrating expertise in a particular field.&nbsp;While AI-generated content can be valuable and efficient, it needs the human touch and contextual understanding that come with genuine expertise. The information in a knowledge graph can help showcase experiences and in-depth knowledge that differentiate humanly-crafted content from AI-generated content.&nbsp;Demonstrating expertise and credibility is crucial for building trust, standing out, establishing authority, engaging an audience, and improving visibility. By addressing the authenticity of content with structured data, it\u2019s possible to provide un-replicable value while strengthening your online presence.The role of WordLift in this picture is to leverage knowledge graphs to generate and validate content at scale; in this way, we have helped clients like Ippen Digital, one of Germany's largest online publishers, to enhance their content with 9,000 enriched tags and 29,000 semantic connections (triples) published to the web.With this process, millions of articles have been marked up and connected to the knowledge graph, generating linked mini-graphs with intelligent features.&nbsp;The test has worked exceptionally well because it provided context to what previously hadn't. And we did so by providing additional information to each piece of content, delivering users a more meaningful and engaging experience.Providing More Information With Structured DataLet's dive into the main Schema.org properties and markups that can help assess authority and build trust online for digital publishers.Targeting Local Queries with Structured DataStructured data plays a crucial role in targeting local queries and meeting the informational needs of specific regions.&nbsp;For example, adding Place markup to news articles about a particular location ensures comprehensive coverage and relevancy for local searches.&nbsp;Citing beloved SEO expert Bill Slawski:\"If you use structured data, you're presenting more precise information to search engines, using data in formats that they expect people to use the search for.\"The Era of Person Schema and Demonstrating ExpertiseThe emergence of the Person Schema Type aligns with Google's framework for assessing the quality of content on websites, known as E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness).&nbsp;To prove E-E-A-T, we can rely on Schema markup for authors, incorporating properties such as sameAs, citations, awards, and credentials.&nbsp;Embedding all the information about our experience in a specific field will help search engines, and AI ecosystems recognize and credit our hands-on expertise in the industry.An example of the markup of my Author page.The more Google recognizes the Author name as an Expert on the topic, the better the authority of their content online.Other Schema.org properties that nurture the E-E-A-T context are:reviewedBycitationknowsAbouthasCredentialClaimReviewawardExceeding Search Engines' ExpectationsThe NewsMediaOrganization markup is an industry-specific type that provides supplementary background information about a news publisher; in this case, the most important properties to compile thoroughly are the founder and address.The founder proves that there is a physical person behind the business. At the same time, the address demonstrates that the organization exists physically, adding up to its authority.Is this work of data sourcing for Google only?The answer is NO.It's for everyone.It's for us as a digital community of publishers and users, and it aims at:A better and safer AI to which everyone can contributeSpreading good information and avoiding fake newsProviding more value to editorial teamsStructuring Hands-On Experience SemanticallyIncorporating structured data in the form of metadata has several benefits in terms of SEO for news publishers:Traffic boostComprehensive coverage of topicsContent recognizable as a reliable source for AI ecosystems.&nbsp;At WordLift, our strategy includes search demand analysis, planning, validation, and publishing content enriched with structured data. By monitoring the performance, we continuously optimize and improve the content, proving to our customers that a published knowledge graph drives the ROI of their digital marketing campaigns.When updating existing articles to assess E-E-A-T, we focus mainly on the following schema Properties within the Article markup:Author - with information about the person who wrote the article; this is a Person type markupdatePublished - Article property, to assess when the article was published and how old it isdateModified - Article property that proves content is fresh and updated periodicallyinLanguage - Article property that gives information about the language of the contentPublisher - Organization markup leads to the information about the business that is making available the content onlineAbout &amp; mentions - Article properties that provide contextual information about the topics touched inside the articleQuestions &amp; Answers - FAQPage markup nested inside the Article markupConclusionIn the rapidly evolving digital landscape, optimizing content for AI and differentiating it from AI-generated content is vital to improve SEO for news publishers.&nbsp;Knowledge Graphs are beneficial because they can communicate to search engines and AI ecosystems in the same language: every piece of information in the form of metadata that we include in our content demonstrates expertise, helps in achieving better rankings, improves ROI, and establishes digital publishers as reliable sources of information.&nbsp;Structuring data benefits organizations and contributes to a better and safer AI ecosystem where good information is valued and utilized effectively.Look at Beatrice Gamba's presentation at the Knowledge Graph Conference 2023 -\u00a0The Power of Knowledge Graphs in Modern SEO\u00a0[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

We have changed how we access and use information since the introduction of ChatGPT, Bing Chat, Google Bard, and a superabundance of conversational agents powered by large language models.&nbsp;At the same time, as recently voiced by Computer scientist Yejin Choi during her talk (Why AI Is Incredibly Smart and Shockingly Stupid | Yejin Choi | TED), \"AI is a Goliath.\" Today's applications depend on a third-party API that leverages massive transformer-based models that have been trained with trillions of words, huge investments, and a consistent environmental impact (according to Bloomberg training GPT-3 required 1.287 gigawatt-hours, this is the equivalent of the yearly electrical consumption of a community of 120 houses in the US).&nbsp;As we progress, Google's Search Generative Experience will mainly feature AI-generated content. Our company started automating and scaling content production for large brands during the Transformers era, which began in 2020. While we prioritize maintaining a good relationship between humans and technology, it's evident that user expectations have evolved, and content creation has fundamentally changed already.Additionally, there is a growing trend in the content industry toward creating interactive conversational applications prioritizing content quality and engagement rather than producing static content.Achieving interactive quality content at scale requires deep integration between neural networks and knowledge representation systems. Yejin Choi suggests distilling symbolic knowledge to infuse language models with common sense and, like many others in the industry (unexpectedly including OpenAI\u2019s CEO Sam Altman), promotes the adoption of smaller models that do not have to encapsulate the entire world\u2019s knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also becoming evident that responsible AI systems cannot be developed by a limited number of AI labs worldwide with little scrutiny from the research community. Thomas Wolf from the HuggingFace team recently noted that pivotal changes in the AI sector had been accomplished thanks to continuous open knowledge sharing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Generative AI is a powerful tool for good as long as we keep a broader community involved and invert the ongoing trend of building extreme-scale AI models that are difficult to inspect and in the hands of a few labs.A More Cost-Effective Approach To Generative AI: Augmenting LLMs With Knowledge GraphsAugmented data retrieval is a new approach to generative AI that combines the power of deep learning with the traditional methods of information extraction and retrieval. Using language models to understand the context of a user's query in conjunction with semantic knowledge bases and neural search can provide more relevant and accurate results.Computer scientist Zdenko \"Denny\" Vrande\u010di\u0107, co-founder of Wikidata and considered the godfather of Google's Knowledge Graph, clearly demonstrated the different performances behind a simple query between ChatGPT, Google, and Wikidata (he used as the query \"Who created the School of Athens?\").&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a difference in computational resources and, therefore, in the cost behind the execution of the query. As Denny explained, OpenAI and Google rely on the world\u2019s fastest and most expansive hardware, while Wikidata runs on a \u201csemi-abandoned\u201d single server. This is obvious from the technical point of view as models have to handle multiple layers with hundreds of billion potential outputs (one token after the other). On the contrary, a query on a KG (even large as Wikidata) is a simple lookup: a logarithmic operation across 100+ million entities. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The high costs associated with generative AI are related to the training (from millions to billions of dollars) of the model and its use, making LLMs inaccessible for many and unfriendly to the environment. Smaller models like PaLM 2 (the small version), Alpaca, BloomZ, and Vicuna can still be very effective when coupled with well-structured knowledge and neural search.&nbsp;The emergence of relatively small models opens a new opportunity for enterprises to lower the cost of fine-tuning and inference in production. It helps create a broader and safer AI ecosystem as we become less dependent on OpenAI and other prominent tech players.In one of my latest experiments, I used Bard (based on PaLM 2) to analyze the semantic markup of a webpage. On the left, we see the analysis in a zero-shot mode without external knowledge, and on the right, we see the same model with data injected in the prompt (in context learning).&nbsp;LLMs, by design, hallucinate: Bard alone (left side) made five factual mistakes in the completion. It only committed one minor inaccuracy (right side) when provided with the correct data. This simple experiment tells us that we possibly don\u2019t need the large version of Bard; we can use a smaller (and less expensive) language model to \u201cnarrate\u201d the same piece of information well.Clement Delangue, CEO and co-founder of HuggingFace, recently said: \u201cMore companies would be better served focusing on smaller, specific models that are cheaper to train and run.\u201d&nbsp;Extracting the right piece of content, of course, remains challenging. Where is the information coming from?&nbsp;When creating semantically related links on e-commerce websites, we first query the knowledge graph to get all the candidates (semantic recommendations). We use vectors to assess the similarity and re-rank options, and at last, we use a language model to write the best anchor text. While this is a relatively simple SEO task, we can immediately see the benefits of neuro-symbolic AI compared to throwing sensitive data to an external API.The New Regulatory Frameworks On AI: More (Secure) Data And Fewer Parameters!AI technologies are transforming the way we access and use information. However, AI must be used responsibly and ethically if we want to create a safe and healthy environment.That is why I support the need for a global AI regulatory framework. Such a framework ensures that AI is used in a way that benefits society and does not pose any undue risks.This brings back attention to the AI value chain, from the pile of data behind a model to the applications that use it. It is hard to improve safety when things happen behind closed doors. As much as new models push the boundaries of what is possible, the natural moat for every organization is the quality of its datasets and the governance structure (where data is coming from, how data is being produced, enriched and validated).An early overview of the proposals coming from both the US and the EU demonstrates the importance for any organization to keep control over security measures, data control, and the responsible use of AI technologies. In other words, I do expect, also, compliance with the upcoming regulations, less dependence on external APIs, and stronger support for open-source technologies. This basically means that organizations with a semantic representation of their data will have stronger foundations to develop their generative AI strategy and to comply with the upcoming regulations.Large Language Models As Reasoners: How We Can Use LLMs To Enrich And Expand Knowledge GraphsCapabilities of LLMs as ReasonersLarge language models (LLMs) have been trained on massive datasets of text, code, and structured data. This training allows them to learn the statistical relationships between words and phrases, which in turn allows them to generate text, translate languages, write code, and answer questions of all kinds.In recent years, LLMs have also been shown to be capable of reasoning. This means that they can be used as a backbone of intelligent agents that understand and apply information from multiple sources. For example, we are using LLMs already on our website to:Audit and analyze the structured data from the homepage of any website. Here the LLMs interact with our APIs for structured data extraction and analysis,AI question answering from web pages,&nbsp;&nbsp;A chat-powered search for our documentation (docs.wordlift.io).How LLMs Can Be Used To Extract And Organize Knowledge From Unstructured DataUnstructured data is any type of data that does not have a predefined structure, such as text, images, and videos. This data type can be difficult to understand and process using traditional methods. However, LLMs can be used to extract and organize knowledge from unstructured data in a number of ways.For example, in the AI question-answering tool an LLM is used to extract and identify entities and relationships in web pages.&nbsp;Using entities, we can sift through QAs from different web pages.Using LLMs to extract and organize knowledge from unstructured data, we can enrich the data in a knowledge graph and bring additional insights to our SEO\u2019s automated workflows. As noted by the brilliant Tony Seale, as GPT models are trained on a vast amount of structured data, they can be used to analyze content and turn it into structured data.&nbsp;Here is a quick example of how things work behind the scenes: a simple question is automatically answered and turned into a json-ld object.&nbsp;Combining LLMs And Knowledge Graphs: A Couple Of SEO Use CasesIn practical terms, we can construct a neurosymbolic system by fine-tuning a language model with data from a knowledge graph or by guiding its predictions using in-context learning (data is extracted in real-time from a knowledge graph and incorporated into the prompt).Let's dive deeper into these two scenarios. Content is a dynamic entity capable of catering to long-tail intents such as \"What are the opening hours of the park in front of restaurant ABC?\" or \"What are the celiac options for breakfast at restaurant ABC?\" while adjusting to different interfaces. We are poised to revolutionize traditional publishing workflows in a world governed by generative AI. However, if the content is spontaneously generated, how do we retain control over the tone of voice? How do we nurture meaningful interactions with our audience when the AI is the author? As Denny Vrande\u010di\u0107 eloquently puts it, the answer is that \"In a world of infinite content, knowledge becomes valuable.\"In Layman\u2019s terms, this implies that by employing semantically rich data, we can monitor and validate the predictions of large language models while ensuring consistency with our brand values. Google hasn\u2019t stopped investing in its knowledge graph since it introduced Bard and its generative AI Search Experience, quite the opposite.&nbsp;Publishers, store owners, and digital marketers should do the same and ask themselves: where is the data to power our next generative application? How can we optimize our content to train a better model? What is the source of this data? How can we validate the generated content against our editorial guidelines?Creating personalized content demands a wide range of data, starting with training data. To fine-tune a model, we need high-quality content and data points that can be utilized within a prompt. Each prompt should comprise a set of attributes and completion that we can rely on.In other scenarios, such as an e-commerce shopping assistant, we can leverage product metadata and frequently asked questions to provide the language model with the appropriate information for interacting with the end user. Whether we opt for fine-tuning, in-context feeding, or a blend of both, the true competitive advantage will not lie in the language model but in the data and its ontology (or shared vocabulary).Creating product descriptions for product variants successfully applies our neuro symbolic approach to SEO. Data from the Product Knowledge Graph is utilized to fine-tune dedicated models and assist us in validating the outcomes. Although we maintain a human-in-the-loop system to handle edge cases and continually refine the model, we're paving the way for content teams worldwide, offering them an innovative tool to interact and connect with their users.&nbsp;Editors now discuss training datasets and validation techniques that can be applied to both new and existing content at an unprecedented scale. There is no coming back, and it is fascinating. Yet, while the underlying technology is similar, it is not like using ChatGPT from the OpenAI website simply because the brand owns the model and controls the data used across the entire workflow. It is about finding the correct prompt while dealing with hundreds of possible variations. I always share internally with our team the idea that the content editor (or the SEO) using our generation tool is like a deejay or an electronic music artist that constantly interacts with nobs, pedals, and plugins to find the right sound to craft the perfect experience for the audience.&nbsp;No one has ever arrived at the prompt that will be used in the final application (or content) at the first attempt, we need a process and a strong understanding of the data behind it.We are currently exploring various AI-driven experiences designed to assist news and media publishers and eCommerce shop owners. These experiences leverage data from a knowledge graph and employ LLMs with in-context transfer learning. This article serves as a practical demonstration of this innovative concept and offers a sneak peek into the future of agentive SEO in the era of generative AI. As the author of this article, I invite you to interact with \u201cAskMe,\u201d a feature powered by the data in the knowledge graph integrated into this blog.

SEO in 2023 is something different, and it is tremendously exciting to create the future of it (or at least contribute to it).&nbsp;WordLift will become an intelligent orchestrator for the company's online presence. It builds a comprehensive Knowledge Graph, the pulsing heart of the platform. To enrich data, the platform (Data Collection &amp; Integration Layer) constantly assimilates and improves data from the company's website, social media channels, and other data sources (the product information management system, the CRM, and so on).&nbsp;WordLift is leveraging a Generative AI Layer to create engaging, SEO-optimized content. We want to further extend its creativity to visuals (Image and Video AI subsystem), enhancing any multimedia asset and creating an immersive user experience. WordLift employs a Linked Data subsystem to market metadata to search engines, improving content visibility and user engagement directly on third-party channels. We are adding a new Chatbot AI subsystem to let users engage with their audience and offer real-time assistance to end customers.Peering through the lens of the Data Analysis &amp; Insights Layer, WordLift needs to provide clients with critical insights and actionable recommendations, effectively acting as an SEO consultant. We are already integrating data from the KG inside reporting platforms like Microsoft Power BI and Google Looker Studio. A user-friendly interface (Dashboard) ensures that SEO teams can navigate smoothly through its functionalities. Against the backdrop, the Security and Compliance Layer shall be added to keep your data safe and in line with upcoming AI regulations (are we watermarking the content? Are we fact-checking the information generated?). The platform also features a Neural Search Engine, serving as the website's guide, helping users navigate and find content seamlessly. Thanks to Content embedding, it understands and translates existing content into a language that an LLM can understand.&nbsp;As an architect, it designs and expands the website's structure through Ontology Import and Design. It has assimilated and extended the Dialogic Principles and Schema.org affordances developed by Teodora Petkova.&nbsp;With WordLift, as I envision it, you're not just building a website but creating an AI-powered, data-driven universe.ReferencesHow Google and Microsoft taught search to \u201cunderstand\u201d the Web - SEAN GALLAGHERKnowledge graphs and GraphQL: What DevOps pros need to know - Beth PariseauKnowledge Graphs in End-User Products: From Cyc to AI Assistants - LinkedInHow Knowledge Graphs Can Help Asset Managers In 2020 - ForbesEnhancing Knowledge Graph Construction Using Large Language Models - Cornell UniversitySKILL: Structured Knowledge Infusion for Large Language Models - Cornell UniversityEnhancing Knowledge Graph Construction Large Language Models[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "Dynamic Internal Links in SEO:\u00a0Your Superhero in the Generative AI Era Table of contents: On the importance of internal links in the generative AI eraWhy should big websites and e-commerce platforms be concerned about their SEO internal linking efforts in the era of generative AI?Why Is Internal Linking Important For E-Commerce Product Pages In The Era Of Generative AI?OK, I got it, but how can I combine dynamic internal links for SEO with schema markup to increase SEO revenue even more?What is the best way to implement dynamic internal links for SEO?What can I expect in the last stage of the dynamic internal links process?What's next for dynamic internal links in SEO?On The Importance Of Internal Links In The Generative AI EraInternal links play a crucial role in optimizing a website's visibility and ranking on search engine result pages (SERPs). These links connect different pages within a website, enabling search engines to crawl and index the content more effectively. When search engine bots encounter internal links, they follow them to discover and index additional pages on the website.One of the primary benefits of internal linking is the enhancement of website navigation. By strategically placing relevant internal links, website visitors can easily explore and access related content. This improves user experience, reduces bounce rates, and encourages visitors to spend more time on the site, which indirectly signals to search engines that the website offers valuable and engaging content.Over time, the evolution of internal links has been influenced by various factors. Initially, search engines relied heavily on the number of internal links to determine a website's relevance and importance. However, as search algorithms evolved, the focus shifted toward the quality and relevance of the linked content. Search engines began analyzing the anchor text used in internal links to understand the context and relevance of the linked pages.In recent years, the concept of topic clusters and pillar pages has gained prominence. This approach involves creating comprehensive pillar content that serves as a hub for a specific topic. Internal links are then used to connect supporting articles or subtopics to the pillar page, signaling to search engines the website's expertise in that particular area. This topical clustering strategy helps search engines better understand the website's content structure and improve its ranking for relevant search queries.Internal links still play a vital role in SEO (big time), and facilitate the processes of&nbsp; effective crawling and indexing by search engines. By leveraging internal linking techniques, websites can improve their visibility, organic traffic, and ultimately, their success in the digital landscape.Why Should Big Websites And E-Commerce Platforms Be Concerned About Their SEO Internal Linking Efforts In The Era Of Generative AI?In the era of generative AI, internal links continue to play a crucial role in optimizing websites, particularly for big e-commerce platforms. As AI technology advances, search engines have become more adept at understanding content context and relevance. Internal links guide search engine algorithms in comprehending website structure and relationships, ultimately ensuring optimal visibility and ranking. For large e-commerce websites, internal links are of utmost importance due to the extensive volume and complexity of their content.&nbsp;A key aspect where internal links prove their vitality for big e-commerce websites is in the navigation and organization of product categories and subcategories. By incorporating internal links within category pages, websites can establish a logical and interconnected hierarchy, enabling users and search engines to navigate through various sections seamlessly. This improves user experience by facilitating efficient product discovery and simultaneously signals to search engines the significance and relevance of different categories.It's not only about adding schema or inserting random links: it's about enhancing the entire workflow by prioritizing user needs and intentions. This is accomplished through cutting-edge automation that efficiently captures these requirements on a large scale. Why is scale important? Well, because prominent SEO and e-commerce websites like yours possess extensive data that requires careful filtering before it can be effectively utilized. To tackle this challenge, we require an intelligent approach that empowers us to execute state-of-the-art SEO work.Our enhanced process involves the generation of links and the enrichment of knowledge graphs, utilizing APIs from the front-end to consistently obtain a relevant list of links, accompanied by the appropriate markup for each specific case. Additionally, our team of technology and data experts have refined the algorithm to implement a neurosymbolic approach. We utilize the graph to identify pages that align well within a given context. For instance, we can exclusively list women's products or identify products that are similar or can complement each other effectively. In the subsequent phase, we employ embeddings to analyze semantic similarity. To provide greater control, our data team has also introduced filters and thresholds to the system, enabling SEO professionals to design and architect interlinked pages as needed. Achieving this level of sophistication is no easy feat, requiring a combination of business acumen, technical excellence, SEO expertise, and comprehensive know-how to maximize the potential of the entire SEO process.We also added a re-ranking to accommodate the business needs:&nbsp;You are the one who dictates the direction of the algorithms: do we favour pages that sell best or shall we instead focus on items we should push out?We began writing anchor text using HuggingFace models like FLAN and we work with SEOs to get the best prompt for the task (we can experiment with the prompt and the model using the webapp);We do not send data to ChatGPT as this would be risky for large brands in our opinion;Shortly explained, you will be fully covered by our approach!Our data and clients' work has showed us that we also needed to eriched data in the KG to bring better recommendations (i.e. we can use zero-shot classification to add the seasonality and filter our categories that would not fit with the current season). And those are just a few of the nitty-gritty details that we delved into beneath the surface. Remember, to accomplish this effectively, quickly, and at scale, you need the assistance of experienced SEO and data professionals who can guide you on your SEO journey.Why Is Internal Linking Important For E-Commerce Product Pages In The Era Of Generative AI?Internal links also play a critical role in cross-linking related products or product variants. By interconnecting relevant product pages, e-commerce websites can provide users with additional options and recommendations, thereby increasing the likelihood of conversion and purchase. These internal links assist search engines in understanding product relationships, contributing to the overall authority and relevance of the website.Furthermore, internal links support the dissemination of vital information throughout the website, including shipping policies, return policies, FAQs, and customer reviews. By linking these pages to relevant product pages, websites ensure that users can easily access essential details, leading to improved transparency, trust, and overall user experience.This holds particularly true in the era of generative AI, as we are witnessing a deluge of AI-generated content. Consequently, both your total crawl budget and Google's crawling processes are shrinking due to the need to establish priorities. To ensure the discoverability, usability, and reusability of your content, it is imperative that your most significant money pages are included in Google's search index. Relying solely on index tags, exceptional content, and PR efforts is insufficient if the content remains undiscovered by crawlers, hindering their ability to process, analyze, rank, and index your business-relevant pages.Ok, I Got It, But How Can I Combine Dynamic Internal Links For SEO With Schema Markup To Increase Revenue Even More?We're glad that you asked! There are some advanced schema markups&nbsp; that can help enrich the user experience and SEO benefits to the next level. Those are:significantLink schema markup propertyrelatedLink schema markup propertyAs Daniel K Cheung explains in his article, significantLink is primarily designed to be used in conjunction with CollectionPage schema markup. Its purpose is to highlight significant links, such as important categories or parent pages, that you wish to prioritize in the crawling and indexing process. From a technical standpoint, search engines like Google face challenges in algorithmically determining the importance of specific elements from a business perspective. Therefore, utilizing these signals allows them to effectively tailor their algorithms to suit your specific needs.The same holds for the relatedLink schema markup property which is also used in combination with CollectionPage but it's mostly intended for less relevant, but still important pages, like related and similar products on your e-commerce platfrom.Both of them are super nice way to architect for your internal PageRank and page value distribution.&nbsp;What Is The Best Way To Implement Dynamic Internal Links For SEO?Automated dynamic internal links are the solution that the big SEO and e-commerce industry has been eagerly awaiting. The data-driven approach is the way forward. By combining data from multiple sources into a single dashboard, you can achieve automatic link tagging and establish high-quality connectivity between your money pages on your platform. To accomplish this, a custom pipeline setup is required, one that considers your optimization opportunities and revenue generation in a scalable manner, aligning with your business objectives.What Can I Expect In The Last Stage Of The Dynamic Internal Links Process?The final stage entails placing emphasis on the anchor text that accurately describes the link in semantic terms. What's even more significant is that we're now obtaining data for smaller websites (with up to 10,000 SKUs), and our observations indicate that rewriting the anchor text can result in increased clicks by reducing the overall number of queries that each page attracts. When super-focused user intents are combined with an SEO strategy, they always yield the best results when implemented together!Optimize your anchor text by using a FREE APP developed by Andrea Volpini\ud83d\udd0eTRY NOWWhat's Next For Dynamic Internal Links In SEO?SEO is a difficult field to navigate because it's operating in an area where the factors that are influencing our work are not publicly known (I'm referring to the ranking factor that search engines like Google use to rank websites). Also, with the new generative search experience it's always challenging to make proper predictions, however, we're definitely observing the following trends and SEO evolutions:There is going to be a shift towards more focused semantic recommendations, either through link sculpting, schema markup explanations or knowledge graph implementation.The ability to spot new potential opportunities (while building the data behind the model). This data needs to be carefully curated, maintained and checked to ensure highest data quality standards.The ability to suggest pruning actions when it's needed because content generation also brings up the responsibility to cut off the low-value pages over time.Ready to start optimizing your semantic relevance and sculpt your PageRank with us today?

When it comes to Black Friday SEO, generative AI can play a pivotal role in content generation, automation, personalization, and efficiency.&nbsp;Even more, there have been some substantial changes in how merchant data is interacting with the Google shopping experience in the past year. We can observe that there are two tectonic shifts for merchants to consider. Checkout in Google SERPsCheckout is happening or will happen soon on the search engine results pages (SERPs). According to Kevin Indig who posted about this on Twitter, this is \"a powerful way of directly sending customers to your checkout page from free organic listings\". Here's how that looks like/will look like:As you can tell, this is a great period to launch this experiment worldwide, before the high season starts with Black Friday &amp; Cyber Monday in just a few months.Bing suggesting new products using AIBing is using AI to suggest products - according to their official statement \"Bing's goal is to bring more joy to shopping\u2014from the initial spark of inspiration to the exciting unboxing experience\u2014by making the process easier and giving you confidence, you\u2019re getting the right item at the right price.\"What can you do to stay ahead of the curve? Our vision and recommended approach is to anticipate the idea of semantic, ontology-based prompting, where structured data is fed into a large language model (LLM) and used for validating the output. WordLift is proud to be one of the companies that pioneer ontology-based prompting to help you construct data-informed prompts which will use data programmatically.How Marketers Can Prepare Their Black Friday SEO PlansNow in this area of Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and holiday sales in general, we have direct experience with the following:Merchant Feed + Structured Data are interconnected. Data out of sync will stop your ads campaign. Merchant metadata is richer at the moment (Google is trying to make them converge but there are still differences as for the sale price). Instead of waiting, we can establish and use your data in your product knowledge graph on top of the PKG to run technical SEO optimizations.We can re-generate using data about sales (or campaigns) product descriptions or Product Listing Pages (PLPs) intro text at scale to boost sales by feeding to a large language model (LLM):the existing descriptionthe sales price of the items we want to promotea few examples of product descriptions or PLP intro text that would work effectively for SEO (or creative copy taken from the campaign).To sum up, the quality of your data and data curation workflows is crucial for this to perform in the best possible way.[et_pb_section global_module=\"20980\"][/et_pb_section]Here are also some other ways that SEO marketers can effectively use to prepare for Black Friday 2023 in the era of generative AI:Streamline Content Creation: Generative AI empowers marketers to streamline content creation for marketing purposes. By leveraging AI models, marketers can effortlessly generate text and content that aligns with their brand's style and tone.

AI-powered chatbots can handle customer service inquiries, provide real-time support, and offer personalized recommendations based on user preferences. This automation elevates the customer experience and allows marketers to dedicate more time to other critical aspects of Black Friday campaigns.Embrace AI and Automation for Fulfillment: Black Friday triggers a surge in online orders, demanding efficient fulfillment from retailers. AI-driven tools, such as robotics and automated software, optimize warehouse operations, streamline order processing, and ensure round-the-clock fulfillment centers. By embracing AI and automation, retailers can steer clear of stockouts, enhance customer satisfaction, and capitalize on the growing trend of online shopping during Black Friday &amp; Cyber Monday.To effectively prepare for Black Friday 2023 in the era of generative AI, marketers must prioritize the adoption of AI technologies and leverage the benefits they offer. Staying updated with the latest advancements is crucial, as it allows marketers to explore how these technologies can enhance content creation, personalization, automation, and SEO optimization. By embracing generative AI and seamlessly integrating it into their Black Friday marketing strategies, marketers can deliver more efficient and impactful campaigns, gain a competitive edge, and achieve better results in the dynamic landscape of Black Friday &amp; Cyber Monday sales.The key to maximizing the potential of generative AI lies in integrating it with an intelligent content framework. This framework should incorporate carefully selected schema markups to facilitate content comprehension and harness the advantages of organic rankings.What Twitter And Independent Research Have Taught UsThe end-of-the-year holiday season is probably the most interesting time for buyers worldwide: everyone is waiting for Black Friday &amp; Cyber Monday to come up and catch a good deal. Customer behavior reshaped a lot, especially after Covid-19: businesses that were late to their digital transformation and understanding the importance of selling on the Internet started shifting their mindsets and preparing themselves to build their business online.&nbsp;Your success and profits, besides other stuff, depend on how well you utilize best-structured data practices to support and aid the experience of your online buyers. Users are thirsty to live better experiences and find what they want faster and at scale. Therefore, your number one priority should be to put your best deals and offers on your website in a way that is easily reachable and understandable and stand out in the huge online battlefield. So, let\u2019s go!We ran a Twitter thread to ask the SEO community (special thanks goes to Rich Tatum) about the least used structured data SEO markups for Black Friday. At the same time, we performed independent research where we analyzed over 107+ popular e-commerce stores (Black Friday pages only) in Switzerland, Germany, the UK, France, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Sweden, Norway, Austria, Europe, and worldwide in general, ordered by their popularity defined by the profits that they gain.&nbsp;Some of the most notable e-commerce brands involve Amazon, eBay, migros.ch, microspot.ch, digitec.ch, Mediamarkt &amp; MediaWorld stores, bol.com, Decathlon, Tesco, Zalando, Otto, Carrefour, Next, Very, Argos, Wish, Asda, Asos, IKEA, Coop, H&amp;M, Rewe, Lidl,&nbsp; Matas, Zara, Schein, idealo, Boulanger, GearBest, Privalia, Global Savings Group, Anibis.ch, Groupon, Alibaba, AliExpress, Flipkart, Walmart and many more. Here\u2019s what we learned through our automated scraping and summarizing process:Most of the businesses do not even have structured data (over 54%+ of them) or they use the basic schema markups for LocalBusiness, Website, and/or Organization;BreadcrumbList, Offer, and FAQPage are partially underutilized in the study;SaleEvent, CollectionPage, OpeningHoursSpecification, OfferCatalog, imageObject and videoObject, and discountCode were the most underused Black Friday schema markups.Underutilized Black Friday &amp; Cyber Monday Schema Markups - A ListLet us elaborate on the second and the third ones independently, so that you can utilize their powerfully for your e-commerce SEO:BreadcrumbList -&gt; good to use when you have a collection of pages that are interlinked together. The rule here is to use your top pages first in your breadcrumb list while the upcoming pages develop from there, forming a list of ordered, sequential elements. ItemList can be also utilized here too.Offer -&gt; This is reserved for both online and offline deals that you want to showcase on your website, like selling a ticket for an event, streaming occasions, and so on. It goes well in combination with paymentMethod, areaServed, aggregateRating, availabilityStarts, availabilityEnds, category, offeredBy, GTIN, and similar attributes that proved to be helpful in the process.FAQPage -&gt; Great deals come with many unanswered customer questions around the new prices in specific time periods like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. That is why it is important to include the most prominent questions in your webpage by using the FAQPage schema markup. This structured data type goes well with mainContentOfPage, speakable, abstract, about, author, and rating attributes when combined together.SaleEvent -&gt; This one is definitely the most underused across the ecommerce industry. This schema markup is probably the most appropriate for temporary deals (therefore, the use of the word event in its name comes obvious). SaleEvent works perfectly with the audience, contributor, startDate, endDate, eventAttendanceMode, eventStatus (for postponing and rescheduling), location, Offers, subEvent, and sameAs properties. Definitely worth checking out. Ideal when you want to showcase the commercial intent of a webpage compared to the use of FAQPage schema markup which is more informational.CollectionPage -&gt; This is a more specific use of the Webpage schema markup. It can also be used with ItemList together with the mainEntity that references it. This way, it is clear to customers that they are having a collection of items on the webpage that they are seeing. Example:{ \"@context\": \"http://schema.org\", \"@type\": \"CollectionPage\", \"mainEntity\": { \"@type\": \"ItemList\", \"itemListElement\": [ { \"@type\": \"ItemPage\" }, { \"@type\": \"ItemPage\" }, { \"@type\": \"ItemPage\" } ] } };OpeningHoursSpecification -&gt; It is always wise to update your opening hours during specific season periods like the black week so that you can properly inform your online visitors (potential customers) about the right time to reach out to you. Great when used in combination with dayOfWeek, opens, closes, validFrom, validThrough, description, and sameAs attributes.OfferCatalog -&gt; This is basically an ItemList but it refers to a list of products that are offered by the same provider. Very important to know the difference here. Works pretty well when used with itemListOrder, alternateName, description, disambiguatingDescription (useful for differentiating between similar product items), name, sameAs and identifier properties.&nbsp;discountCode -&gt; often misunderstood with the Offer schema markup which usually refers to product schema markup, while this one can refer to a service. This is still not part of Google's Search Gallery, so you cannot expect to obtain a rich snippet on the SERPs by using it, however, it is still a good choice when providing discounts to stuff or working with a coupons website.ImageObject and VideoObject are quite similar, so we will cover them together. They are particularly useful when you want to provide more images of your products or have a video overview (e.g. games products). The 3DModel schema markup can also prove interesting for advanced ecommerce brands who utilize the power of augmented reality to show off their products in a more interactive way with their audience during the black cyber season.Selling More And Going Beyond Prompting And Schema MarkupsCustomers' expectations can go beyond prompting and simple schema markup fixing. In order to help you position yourself as competitively and intelligently as possible, we developed our Business + E-commerce Plan which uses the WordLift and Product Knowledge Graph Builder. By using both of them you can easily import your data from your Merchant Feed and enrich it with structured data, streamlining your schema markup creation and building a basis to develop new customer experience on top of that knowledge base.FAQs How can SEO help maximize Black Friday sales?Search Engine Optimization (SEO) can play a critical role in maximizing Black Friday sales by driving targeted traffic to a company's website and increasing visibility for key products and promotions.

        "text": "Knowledge Graph In-Context: introducing WordLift\u2019s New Reader for LlamaIndex \ud83e\udd99 and LangChain \ud83e\udd9c\ud83d\udd17 A New Chapter in WordLift's JourneyWe're thrilled to introduce WordLift Reader, a new connector for Llama Index and LangChain, in the spirit of continuous innovation towards generative AI for SEO. This feature represents a small yet significant evolution, enabling users to interact directly using their knowledge graph in engaging conversations.The Power of Bridging Knowledge Graphs with Language ModelsIn our journey to make the web more intelligent and accessible, we've recognized the tremendous potential of combining the structured world of knowledge graphs with the fluid, context-aware capabilities of language models (LMs). This fusion that we call neuro-symbolic AI is a game-changer. With their ability to store and organize vast amounts of information, knowledge graphs provide a solid foundation of relevant facts and relationships. On the other hand, LLMs, with their capacity to understand and generate human-like text, bring a level of personalization that static web pages simply can't match. We're enhancing and fundamentally transforming the user experience by bridging these two powerful technologies.&nbsp;We're moving from a world where information is passively consumed to a digital ecosystem where users engage in rich, vibrant, and personalized conversations with the help of semantic concepts and structured data.&nbsp;Modern Architecture for Generative AI AppsThe emerging architecture for LLM applications is a fascinating blend of new and existing technologies. I live the AI hype and the evolution of its stack with similar enthusiasm that I had back in the mid-nineties when Mosaic was the interface to the Internet.&nbsp;Large Language Models (LLMs) are a powerful new tool for building software, but their unique characteristics require a combination of old ETL techniques and innovative approaches (embeddings, prompting, intent matching) to leverage their capabilities fully. The reference architecture for the LLM app stack includes standard systems, tools, and design patterns used by AI startups and tech companies.The architecture, as depicted by a16z, is primarily focused on in-context learning; this is the ability of LLMs to be controlled through clever prompting techniques and access to private \u201ccontextual\u201d data.&nbsp;The&nbsp; architecture can be divided into three core areas:data preprocessing/embedding. This is where our KG enters into action along with the new connector. It\u2019s within the preprocessing stage that semantic data can be used and sliced before being passed through an embedding model and a set of indices (vector stores being the most common type).&nbsp;In the prompt construction stage, a series of prompts are compiled to submit to the LLM. The prompts combine a hard-coded template, examples of valid outputs, information from external APIs, and relevant documents retrieved from the vector database.&nbsp;In the inferencing stage, the prompts are submitted to a pre-trained LLM for prediction.LlamaIndex, LangChain, Semantic Kernel and other emerging frameworks orchestrate the process and represent an abstraction layer on top of the LLM.&nbsp;The WordLift connector loads the data we need from the knowledge graph using GraphQL, a query language introduced by Facebook that allows for precise, efficient data fetching. With only a few lines of code, we can specify exactly what data we need by extracting from our KG the sub-graphs we want. We do this by using specific properties of the schema.org vocabulary (or any custom ontology we use).GraphQL enables the connector (WordLift Reader) to stay updated with the latest changes on the website without the need for crawling, ensuring that all conversations are always based on the most current data. This seamless integration via GraphQL between our KGs and Llama Index (or LangChain) enables the connector to transform static, structured data into dynamic, interactive conversations.Modularization: Tailoring Conversations to User NeedsWe are incorporating the concept of modularization into the new AI generative stack for SEO. We can see blocks like the \"TalkMe\" widget introduced in my previous blog post to \"modularize\" conversations; the connector has been designed to use different sub-graphs and provide specific responses. This feature allows us to tailor conversations to the specific needs of users.In the example below, a Shopping assistant is built by accessing the following:schema:Product for product discovery and recommendation;schema:FAQPage for information on the store return policy.&nbsp;Let\u2019s review the dialogue intents that we can address using only product data and using product data and Q&amp;A content.&nbsp;The power to leverage your Knowledge Graph built using schema.org for LLMs. On the left the AI uses only schema:Product; on the right the AI uses schema:Product and schema:FAQPage. Here Is How To Connect With Your Audience Using AI AgentsThe notebook below provides a reference implementation that uses our demo e-commerce website. To see how things work, open the link and follow the steps.&nbsp;Ready to jump to the code? \ud83e\ude84 wor.ai/wl-reader-demo&nbsp; (here is a Colab Notebook to see how things work).\ud83d\udcd6 Here is a link to the documentation.We\u2019ll build an AI-powered shopping assistant using LlamaIndex and the Knowledge Graph behind our e-commerce demo website (https://product-finder.wordlift.io/). You must add your OpenAI API key and WordLift Key to run this tutorial. We\u2019ll begin by setting up the environment and installing the required libraries like langchain, openai, llama-index, and API keys.The code's core part is focused on using the WordLiftReader class to build a vector index of the shop\u2019s products.We\u2019ll also see how to create multiple indices based on different schemas classes like schema:Product and schema:FAQPage. This allows the AI agent to handle different types of user queries effectively. For example, the agent can suggest products based on user preferences or provide information about the shop's return policy.To see our connector in action, watch the video with Andrea Volpini, Teodora Petkova and Jason Barnard. Here, you can learn how to create an enriching and interactive experience using the data in the knowledge graph, bridging the gap between users and content.https://youtu.be/EBS-sPWzx_EWhere Data meets Human-Centric Approach [WEBINAR]ConclusionIntroducing our new connector marks a significant step in our mission to make the web smarter and more accessible. By transforming your knowledge graph into interactive conversations, we're enhancing the user experience and paving the way for more effective SEO implementations.We're excited to see how our users will leverage this new tool to create more engaging, personalized, and optimized web experiences.&nbsp;Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to innovate and push the boundaries of what's possible with a synergised combination of KG and LLMs!References and Credits \ud83d\udcdaWordLift Reader on LlamaHubOfficial documentationDemo Notebook (Colab)Great content to read to learn more about LLM + KG:From classic to modern era: what is a dialogue by Teodora PetkovaAI is like an Iceberg by Tony Seale (a survival guide)LLM Ontology-prompting for Knowledge Graph Extraction by Peter LawrenceFAQs How is LlamaIndex different from LangChain?LlamaIndex and LangChain are two open-source libraries that can be used to build applications that leverage the power of large language models (LLMs). LlamaIndex provides a simple interface between LLMs and external data sources, while LangChain provides a framework for building and managing LLM-powered applications. In summary, LlamaIndex is primarily focused on being an intelligent storage mechanism, while LangChain is a tool to bring multiple tools together. At the same time, you can build agents using only LlamaIndex or LlamaIndex as a LangChain agent tool.&nbsp;What orchestrators are available to interface a large language model?Different orchestration frameworks like LangChain and LlamaIndex can help us abstract many of the details of prompt chaining, interfacing with external APIs and extracting knowledge from different sources. The most famous are the Semantic Kernel by Microsoft, FlowwiseAI, Auto-GPT, AgentGPT and BabyAGI. Similar solutions include JinaChat or the Italian Cheshire Cat AI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;",

        "text": "Embracing the Future: How Generative AI is Transforming Publishing for Success Table of contents:Defining Generative AI for PublishersDo I really need a generative AI strategy for my publishing business?How can you integrate generative AI into your content marketing strategy and toolkit?How WordLift is moving in this direction to help publishers use generative AI?Defining Generative AI for PublishersGenerative AI, in the context of search engine optimization (SEO) for publishers and news businesses, refers to the use of artificial intelligence techniques to create original and high-quality content that aligns with the preferences and demands of search engines and users.In the modern AI world, generative AI has tremendous implications for publishers and news businesses. It enables them to streamline and enhance their content creation process, leading to improved search engine rankings, increased organic traffic, and better engagement with their target audience.By leveraging generative AI, editorial teams have the potential to automate whole parts or certain segments of their content generation process, such as articles, blog posts, and product descriptions. This technology utilizes advanced algorithms and natural language processing models to understand the underlying structure and context of the desired content. It then generates human-like text that is coherent, informative, and tailored to specific topics or keywords.Generative AI empowers publishers and news businesses to produce a larger volume of content in less time, allowing them to keep up with the ever-increasing demand for information. It also helps in addressing content gaps and optimizing for specific search queries. You can achieve this by generating relevant content that caters to the interests and intent of their target audience.Moreover, generative AI can aid in personalization efforts by creating customized content based on user preferences, search history, and other available data. This personalized approach enhances user experience, increases engagement, and encourages repeat visits, resulting in higher user satisfaction and loyalty.However, it's important to note that while generative AI can be a valuable tool, it should be used responsibly and ethically. Publishers and news businesses must ensure that the generated content is accurate, reliable, fact-checked, and compliant with journalistic standards. Human oversight and editorial judgment are crucial to maintain credibility and trust with the audience.Do I Really Need A Generative AI Strategy For My Publishing Business?We have been involved in the publishing industry since the inception of the content marketing era, and that is exactly what we practice daily with our WordLift team.

AI, knowledge graphs, and linked data with generative AI have been a thrilling journey to create scalable content that genuinely benefits users.Publishers like yourself are also exploring the possibility of training content and AI models using their content.&nbsp;We strongly advocate for transparency and wholeheartedly support returning control to publishers themselves. In addition to investing significantly in innovative tools and cutting-edge end-to-end SEO solutions for content marketing and publishing businesses, we advocate for implementing \"no AI\" tags and a more detailed definition of what can and cannot be done with content through schema markup strategies.&nbsp;We are actively staying informed about the latest content and AI regulatory initiatives spearheaded by other influential content and AI industry figures. Both Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) and IPTC, the global standards body of the news media, are currently working on various options in this field. We anticipate the introduction of additional subsets of properties soon, specifically in terms of schema markup.How Can You Integrate Generative AI Into Your Content Marketing Strategy And Toolkit?Establishing the proper working framework and internal processes and fostering effective team partnerships is crucial in business and life. Implementing a framework solution, such as a content knowledge graph, empowers you to develop more relevant generative search experiences that are future-proof and enable resilience.Based on our past client experience, this is easier said than done for medium-sized and large companies. They often need to catch up in anticipating these emerging search developments and addressing their users' needs. If your company falls into this category, investing in organizational change, revamping workflows, and even redefining concepts will be essential for your content business.&nbsp;Particularly from a search perspective, it's important to note that SEO has evolved beyond search engine optimization. We are now in the era of organizing and optimizing search experiences. What we used to know about how SEO worked by 2022 already belongs in the past. You need a holistic strategy that covers your content business as a whole, not just some random ChatGPT experimentation done on an individual level.The process of developing content workflows and suitable models to integrate generative AI into your content marketing strategy and toolkit involves several key steps.Define Objectives: Begin by clearly defining your objectives and goals for incorporating generative AI into your content marketing strategy. Determine the specific outcomes you want to achieve and how generative AI can help you in reaching those goals.Assess Data Availability: Evaluate the availability and quality of data that will be used to train the generative AI models. Identify the relevant datasets that align with your content marketing needs and ensure they are comprehensive and representative.Model Selection: Choose the appropriate generative AI model that aligns with your objectives and the nature of your content. Consider factors such as the model's capabilities, performance, and compatibility with your existing toolkit.Data Preprocessing: Prepare and preprocess your data to ensure it is in a suitable format for training the generative AI model. This may involve cleaning and organizing the data, removing any inconsistencies or biases, and transforming it into a format compatible with the model.Training the Model: Train the generative AI model using the preprocessed data. This step involves feeding the data into the model, adjusting parameters, and iteratively refining the model's performance through multiple training cycles.Evaluation and Fine-tuning: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics and validation techniques. Identify areas for improvement and fine-tune the model accordingly to enhance its output quality and relevance.Integration and Workflow Development: Integrate the generative AI model into your existing content marketing workflow. Develop a streamlined process for generating AI-driven content, incorporating the model's outputs into your content creation and distribution pipeline.Monitoring and Iteration: Continuously monitor the performance and impact of the generative AI integration. Gather feedback from users and stakeholders, and iterate on the model and workflows as needed to optimize results and adapt to evolving needs.Throughout this process, it is crucial to maintain ethical considerations, ensure transparency in the use of generative AI, and comply with any relevant regulations and guidelines governing AI technologies.How Wordlift Is Moving In This Direction To Help Publishers Use Generative AI?We've been privileged to work with small and medium-sized companies but also huge brands that were pioneers in innovating intelligent customer experiences in the new generative AI search era.&nbsp;We've also been very fortunate to have an internal team of highly-skilled flexible professionals that know our customers' needs by heart and pride themselves in growing an online publishing business like yours.Here's how we develop our product for the generative AI era.Creating KG-powered Agents to give the reader the opportunity to talk with an article and its authorWe are exploring AI-driven experiences to assist news and media publishers and e-commerce shop owners. These experiences leverage data from a knowledge graph and employ LLM with transfer learning in context.&nbsp;An example is in this article written by Andrea Volpini. In it, you can try the 'AskMe' widget, a function powered by the knowledge graph data embedded in the blog. You can ask questions such as \"What is this article about?\" or \"What are Andrea's thoughts on structured data?\". This is a first step towards empowering authors, putting them at the center of the creative process, and keeping them in complete control.&nbsp;Introducing the Content Generation Tool by WordLiftThis new feature is designed to allow our clients to create high-quality content at scale. This new feature leverages data from the Knowledge Graph, allowing you to generate compelling and customized content for your brand. With it, you can use a query to extract data from your KG and create a customized prompt template to generate engaging content. We have incorporated a robust validation process&nbsp;where you can define your rules to ensure the highest quality and alignment with your brand identity. These rules allow you to fine-tune the generated content, ensuring that the result perfectly encapsulates the desired tone, style, and messaging.Adding the content expansion to the SEO Add-on for Google SheetsWe are working on adding a new function to our SEO Add-on that will allow you to create content parts containing entities you select because they are considered most relevant to your business. This will make optimizing your website's content easier and faster to rank higher in Google right from the start.&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a fine-tuned model to generate descriptions for products and snippets of text that can cover long-tail intentsIt is all about your data. In this case, you can customize the template in its final part and train it using the best content already produced for your brand. For example, we used GPT-3 to generate product descriptions for an e-commerce shop automatically.&nbsp;And so much more! These were just the latest developments\ud83d\udc4fOther Frequently Asked QuestionsHow can generative AI benefit publishers?Generative AI can aid publishers in developing content workflows and content strategies at scale. Combining the right team, organizational culture, tooling, expertise, SEO and AI best practices will be crucial for success.Can generative AI replace human writers in publishing?If your intention is to generate content on a large scale without taking user intents into proper consideration or devising a dedicated content strategy, then the answer is yes. However, if you prioritize high-quality content publishing, a human-in-the-loop approach is essential. This involves leveraging the expertise, best practices, and internal collaboration among teams to facilitate scalable, human-centered content creation.Are there any ethical concerns with using generative AI in publishing?Yes, standardization teams are actively working to determine the most suitable approach for labeling generative AI content, particularly with regard to author rights and addressing misinformation. This is why the combination of human expertise alongside technology proves to be the most effective approach at this current juncture.How can publishers measure the effectiveness of their generative AI strategy?This depends on different business setups and objectives but there are several ideas on how to achieve this. Publishers can measure the effectiveness of their generative AI strategy by analyzing content performance metrics, conversion rates, user feedback and satisfaction, SEO performance, and cost efficiency, conducting a comparative analysis, and monitoring the long-term impact on brand reputation and customer retention. A combination of quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback should be used to obtain a comprehensive evaluation of the strategy's performance.[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "How to Use AI to Optimize Your Content for Voice Search The way we conduct internet searches is rapidly evolving. And we have smart devices and artificial intelligence (AI) to thank for that.&nbsp;Recent reports estimate that at least 50% of the US population uses voice search features daily, and 34% use them at least once a week. What does this mean for your marketing strategy?This shift towards voice search is a golden opportunity for you to fine-tune your content to make it easily accessible to your audience, no matter how they choose to engage.So, how do you rise above the rest in this voice search revolution? It begins with an expertly crafted strategy to optimize your content for voice search. And that\u2019s where AI can help make your content more accessible and engaging for voice search users.In this article, we\u2019ll explore some groundbreaking strategies for using AI to optimize your content for voice search, helping you not only join the conversation but lead it.Understanding AI and Voice SearchAI and voice search technology are no longer concepts of the future \u2014 they're here to stay.&nbsp;In fact, 71% of people would rather use a voice assistant to search for something rather than the traditional way of manually typing it into a search engine.&nbsp;(Image Source)But what exactly are these technologies, and how do they intersect?Artificial intelligence is a broad field that involves the development of tools and systems capable of performing tasks that usually require human intelligence. Or, 54\u201358 in other words, it\u2019s the driving force behind voice search.&nbsp;In fact, AI powers the voice assistants we've come to rely on, like Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant, and Apple's Siri. These voice assistants utilize AI to interpret and respond to voice commands. They can understand natural language, learn from interactions, and even adapt their responses over time.&nbsp;AI algorithms are smart enough to analyze voice data, convert it into text, comprehend the request, and then provide the most relevant response or action. Pretty crazy, right?So what does this mean for SEO? Well, a lot.When users perform a voice search, their queries mirror the natural, conversational language we use in everyday speech. On the contrary, when typing, users often adopt a more formal, concise tone.Screenshot by Jeremy MoserThis key distinction emphasizes the importance of adapting your content strategy to infuse conversational keywords (read: long-tail keywords) to get your content to align with this new style of querying information. More on this in a bit.Identifying Voice Search IntentAt this point, you may be asking yourself, \"Is there really a difference between voice search queries and text searches?\" The answer is a resounding yes.As we've briefly mentioned, voice search queries are far from \u200cmere replicas of text searches. They're more conversational, often longer, and usually phrased as questions. For example, \"Where's the nearest Italian restaurant?\" or \"How's the weather today?\"&nbsp;But don't let this intimidate you. This difference provides an opportunity for you to create content that answers these questions directly, satisfying your audience's immediate needs and capturing their attention in an increasingly competitive digital space.So, how do you analyze user intent for voice search? Start by examining the questions your audience is asking. Look for patterns and common themes.&nbsp;Are they seeking product information like prices or looking to make a purchase? The answer to this question will provide valuable insight into their intent, allowing you to tailor your content accordingly.(Image Source)Tools like Surfer SEO, which uses AI and machine learning for SEO, also help you to gain a deeper understanding of user intent behind each query and effectively optimize your articles for voice search. More on that next.&nbsp;Optimizing Content for Voice SearchAre you still with us? Now that you\u2019ve identified the search intent behind common voice searches in your niche, it\u2019s time to optimize that content to perform well.&nbsp;Here\u2019s what you need to know.&nbsp;Step 1: Keyword ResearchLike every other piece of content that you create online, the first step is keyword research. But in this case, the primary focus is conversational language. In other words, long-tail and natural language phrases.&nbsp;&nbsp;AI-powered tools like AnswerThePublic or Google's People Also Ask feature can provide a wealth of data on the types of questions users are asking related to your niche.Screenshot by Jeremy MoserOh, and don\u2019t overlook keyword research tools like Ahrefs or Semrush. They can be particularly useful to help you find focus on long-tail keywords that often resemble the more conversational tone of voice search. Look for conversational phrases that begin with question words like \u201cwho,\u201d \u201cwhat,\u201d etc.And finally, you can always scour for questions related to your niche within popular forums like Quora and Reddit. By simply examining the thread titles, you\u2019ll unlock a treasure trove of information.Step 2: Leverage Structured Data to Land Featured SnippetsIn the era of voice search, where people rely on voice assistants in their daily lives, optimizing your content for this evolving landscape is more crucial than ever.&nbsp;So why not leverage Google's featured snippets? Google displays these coveted featured snippets at the top (or sometimes top right of) organic search results. They could appear as simple text definitions or bulleted or numbered lists.&nbsp;Screenshot by Jeremy MoserBy structuring your content to answer commonly asked questions, you increase the chances of your content being picked up for these snippets.\u200b\u200bWhile we can't make any promises that your content will certainly snag that snippet, we do have a handful of savvy tips to increase your odds:Aim for brevity and precision in your answers to common questions \u2014 keep them within 54-58 words.Always be on the lookout to incorporate question-based queries into your content.Include step-by-step instructions to empower searchers in solving their issues.Use headers and paragraph tags to streamline your page structure.Embrace the definition-style approach when it's relevant.And if your eyes just rolled to the back of your head. Don\u2019t worry. That\u2019s where a tool like WordLift really shines. WordLift is an AI-powered SEO tool that analyzes your text and adds structured data to your content without requiring any extra work or technical knowledge.(Image Source)In other words, WordLift can do the heavy lifting for you. And now, your content is more understandable for search engines and can rank better in SERPs.&nbsp;The result? A boost in organic traffic to your website and a better chance of driving more sales. In fact, we\u2019ve seen a US retail customer increase impressions by 85% and clicks by 18%. Not too shabby.&nbsp;Step 3: Prioritize Mobile Optimization for Voice SearchKeep in mind that most voice searches are conducted via mobile devices. So don\u2019t skimp out on mobile optimization.&nbsp;Making sure that your website is mobile-friendly and loads quickly can significantly enhance the user experience and improve your chances of appearing in voice search results.Need some inspiration? Research indicates that, surprisingly, dentists are the top businesses optimized for voice search. Crazy, right?&nbsp;So let\u2019s turn to a shining example of mobile and speed optimization with DentalInsurance.com. They've taken proactive measures to optimize their page for mobile devices, resulting in impressive results.&nbsp;As shown in the screenshot below, their dental insurance in Florida page scored 87/100 in the Pingdom speed test. This successful optimization has led to improved rankings for multiple local keywords in voice searches, resulting in high-quality traffic and valuable leads.(Image Source)Step 4: Streamline the Publishing ProcessYou've put in the effort, and finally, your content is optimized and ready to shine in the voice search realm. Exciting, right? But wait, before you dive headfirst into the publishing process, have you considered how you can make this process smoother and more efficient?Think of all the hours you've spent in the past painstakingly copying and pasting content, fixing formatting errors, and adjusting headers. Now imagine bypassing all that. Sounds tempting, doesn't it? Enter Wordable. With Wordable, you can effortlessly publish your content while preserving all the formatting and optimization in one click.(Image Source)Simply put, with all your content optimized for voice search, it's worth it to employ Wordable to speed up the publishing process. And you\u2019ll even be maintaining your meticulous optimization. It\u2019s about working smarter, not just harder.Technical Considerations for Voice Search OptimizationNow, let\u2019s dive into some of the technical aspects.Have you heard of schema markup? If not, don\u2019t worry. It's a type of vocabulary that you can add to your website to enhance how search engines read and represent your page in SERPs.&nbsp;It helps Google understand your content better, thus increasing the likelihood of your content being picked up for voice searches. And as we mentioned earlier, WordLift will do the semantic SEO heavy lifting for you.Similar to text-based searches, page load speed is also crucial. Nobody likes a slow-loading page, right? The same goes for smart devices.&nbsp;Use tools like Google's PageSpeed Insights to analyze and optimize your load speed. Ideally, your page should load in three seconds or less. And thankfully, Google tells you exactly how to achieve these results.&nbsp;And don't forget about site accessibility. Make sure your site is accessible to all users, including those using screen readers or other assistive technologies.Creating Voice-Friendly ContentIt's time to humanize your content. Write in a conversational tone, as if you're speaking directly to your target audience. Include commonly asked questions and provide concise, straightforward answers. And don't forget to use structured data for FAQ content, helping search engines understand your content better.Here\u2019s an example of a FAQs section by BriteCo, optimized for search questions around jewelry insurance and their specific policy.(Image Source)Adding a dedicated FAQ page is the secret sauce for landing those coveted spots on Google\u2019s featured snippets.&nbsp;Leveraging Voice Search Platforms and DevicesDifferent voice assistants interpret queries in unique ways. So why not optimize for specific voice assistants like Siri or Google Assistant?&nbsp;Additionally, take advantage of the surge in smart speakers and voice-enabled devices. Remember, voice search isn't just on mobile \u2014 it's all around us.So incorporating AI into your content strategy entails more than just optimizing text. It also entails optimizing content distribution across these smart devices.&nbsp;That\u2019s where an AI voice generator tool comes in handy. These tools can convert your text material into natural-sounding voice overs, making the experience more immersive and accessible for consumers that prefer audio content.&nbsp;(Image Source)Not only would employing an AI voice generator tool improve your content for voice search, but it'll also cater to a broader audience, including people who are visually challenged.&nbsp;Moreover, with AI applications such as AI caption generators, voice searches have become even more accessible. This technology can generate accurate, word-by-word subtitles for videos or audio content.&nbsp;This not only makes sure that voice searches are more accurate, but also returns more useful search results. The benefits of this to your audience are twofold: it enhances accessibility for users who rely on subtitles and improves the precision of voice search results.Measuring and Tracking Voice Search PerformanceSo, how do you know if your voice search optimization strategies are working as you\u2019d hope? It's all about keeping track of the proper metrics. Start by identifying voice search traffic in your analytics.&nbsp;You can also keep a close eye on your search engine results, rankings, and featured snippets. The higher you place on the SERPs, the more organic traffic you'll generate.&nbsp;And, of course, always listen to user feedback. Think of these nuggets of information as invaluable insights into your voice search performance.Future Trends in AI and Voice SearchArtificial intelligence is no longer a buzzword. In fact, there\u2019s no sign of investor slowdown in pouring money into AI tools. And it\u2019s changing the world and our consumer behaviors as we know it.The result? Added fuel for the continued advancements in natural language processing that\u2019ll revolutionize voice search, voice commerce, and voice-activated transactions.&nbsp;And did you know that nearly 43% of users already use their voice-enabled devices to shop? People of all ages are turning to their devices for online purchasing. And as we look ahead, voice is on track to become a major player in the market, hitting $40 billion in 2022.(Image Source)Therefore, to tap into this lucrative growth opportunity, it's crucial that marketers today tune in and truly understand the voices of their consumers. It's not just about catching the wave \u2014 it's about riding it to success.Will AI-driven voice search leave traditional SEO in the dust? Probably not. But that doesn't mean there\u2019s a one-size-fits-all solution. The key is to prioritize both forms of SEO to meet your consumers using their preferred form of search.Wrapping UpAs we pull the curtain on this journey through the realm of AI-optimized voice search content, let's not forget the importance of this rapidly growing sector. With voice search becoming a staple in our lives, it's crucial to align your content and SEO strategies to fit this new norm.&nbsp;By understanding voice search intent and optimizing content using conversational keywords, you can ensure your content is heard loud and clear across mobile and smart devices.&nbsp;And let's not shy away from the change in consumer behaviors. Instead, embrace it, adapt, and let your content voice echo in this new era of search. So, are you ready to make the leap into the world of voice search optimization? Let AI guide you on this promising path.[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "Intertwingularity The word intertwingularity was coined by internet pioneer Ted Nelson to represent the idea that everything in the universe is deeply interconnected.Intertwingularity is not generally acknowledged, people keep pretending they can make things deeply hierarchical, categorizable and sequential when they can't. Everything is deeply intertwingled.Ted NelsonThe concept appears within Nelson\u2019s quest to creating a system that empowers creativity and understanding for everyone by allowing them to easily find and make connections.It was in 1960 that Ted Nelson became \u00abinflicted with ideas and designs for non-sequential literature and media\u00bb, as reads the reprinted (in his book Geeks Bearing Gifts) letter he published in 2006 Lost in Hyperspace.Knowing that a better version of computers and programs exist to help us connect the dots, most simply put, Nelson founded Project Xanadu. For various reasons the project had little success and failed to take off, but the deeper constructs Nelson envisioned together with his ideas that everything is connected and that computer systems are yet to become able to represent this interconnectedness, are still what Nelson passionately advocates.In that same letter, he writes:These would facilitate an entire form of literature where links do not break as versions change; where documents may be closely compared side by side and closely annotated; showing the origins of every quotation; and with a copyright system for frictionless, non-negotiated quotation of any amount at any time.Ted Nelson,&nbsp;Lost in hyperspaceThe Promise of IntertwingularityEverything, from code to culture, is connected and the potential of a linking mechanism that can map this connectedness is as fascinating as it is hard to implement.Conceptually, intertwingularity is about multifaceted understandings and multilayered descriptions existing on multiple levels.In practice, the premise is simple: we need to keep track of things, in our writing, reading, and research. But instead of being able to rely on one network that has it all, where all things are linked, we have separate notes, stored in all kinds of different states. This weakens the power of the points of our knowledge-to-become pieces. The real issue is to put all these pieces together without losing track of their sources and relationships with other things.And this is what succeeding to translate intertwingularity into a system will be about: a space which allows us to jump across points of knowing and be able to get back any time, from anywhere. Such infinite connectedness will be a means by which we can meaningfully plug into the accelerating complexity of emerging cyber ecosystems and ideate powerful digital constructs. And it is thinking about and working towards a Web as an intertwingular whole that will broaden and deepen the way we understand and create all things digital, where everything is \u201ckind of a similar and kind of the same, and yet different\u201d.Everything Flows Into Everything: Interconnection, Representation, Sequalization All Similar to the Issue of WaterIn a beautiful metaphor, talking about his experience with the flow of water, Ted Nelson illuminates the concept of intertwingularity though the essence of water, its flow and the interconnectedness in nature.It was an experience of water and interconnection [...] I was trailing my hand in the water and I thought about how the water was moving around my fingers, opening on one side and closing on the other. And that changing system of relationships where everything was kind of a similar and kind of the same, and yet different.That was so difficult to visualize and express, and just generalizing that to the entire universe that the world is a system of ever changing relationships and structures struck me as a vast truth. Which it is.So interconnection and expressing that interconnection has been the centre of all my thinking. And all my computer work has been about expressing and representing and showing interconnection among writings, especially.And writing is the process of reducing a tapestry of interconnections to a narrow sequence. And this is in a sense elicit. This is a wrongful compression of what should spread out.Ted Nelson in Herzog's \"Lo and Behold\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bqx6li5dbEYThe citation above is part of the movie Lo and Behold directed by Werner Herzog and is one of the most succinct description of intertwingularity and of the conceptual understanding needed for building robust and effective computer systems.Understanding the concept of intertwingularity and applying it in our digital activities can bring beautifully much of what we do in cyberspace together, allowing for a space of shared information, knowledge and experience and to emerge.",

        "text": "Unveiling the Power of SEO: A Legal Funding Company's Journey - Case Study As you know, it is crucial for companies to build a brand reputation and reinforce their authority. And having an effective SEO and content marketing strategy means gaining greater visibility on Google and other search engines, which translates into more leads and new customers.&nbsp;You can have a visually pleasing website and offer the best legal, financing and other services, but if the customers looking for them cannot find you, all your efforts are in vain. That is why you must have a state-of-the-art SEO strategy, because only then can you improve your ranking in search results and attract people interested in your services. How can you do this?&nbsp;In this SEO case study, I show you how Express Legal Funding, a Texas-based pre-settlement funding company, achieved a positive impact on website traffic. As the image below shows, looking at the period from November 2022 to June 2023, there was an exponential growth in its organic visibility.&nbsp;Introducing the companyExpress Legal Funding is a reliable pre-settlement funding company with a strong commitment to financially assist injured and damaged plaintiffs throughout their legal claim journey. Based in Plano, Texas, it is dedicated to providing essential financial support to those seeking compensation from the party responsible for their loss. The process involves the company making a non-recourse advance to purchase a stake in the potential case proceeds&nbsp; from a personal injury claim and various types of civil lawsuits.When I met Aaron Winston - Strategy Director at Express Legal Funding - he told me that before meeting the WordLift team, he had created quality site content, and he is well versed in SEO, achieving good results. However, he realized that in order to further optimize and make the most of what he was doing, there was still a piece missing. He knew it was important to educate Google and give it the information it needed to understand who you are and what you do to get more visitors and better rank website content in search results and become an authoritative voice in the industry. He was looking for a sustainable, future-proof, and easy-to-implement solution that would give him an immediate competitive advantage that, once in place, could not be undone. And that's where the WordLift team came in to help Aaron make a difference with his SEO strategy.The request&nbsp;Aaron Winston, as Strategy Director and a legal funding expert, had a clear vision for his online presence. He aimed to improve his website's E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) to establish himself as the go-to authority in the field.&nbsp;The website was already thriving with well-implemented structured data, providing a sturdy groundwork for his digital journey. It's essential to give a shoutout to Aaron's exceptional content, which is undoubtedly top-notch, contributing significantly to the overall outstanding performance of the website.To achieve his goal, Aaron knew he needed to take things to the next level and do what others weren\u2019t. One of his key aspirations was to obtain a knowledge panel\u2014an impressive feature displayed on Google's search results, showcasing essential information about a recognized entity or individual.Obtaining a knowledge panel would not only enhance his online credibility but also boost his website's visibility and attract a wider audience. Aaron realized that this would be a pivotal step in cementing his reputation as \"The Legal Funding Expert.\"What has been done&nbsp;We have implemented several SEO measures to enhance the online presence and authority of Aaron Wiston and Express Legal Funding.&nbsp;First, we implemented Author markup for all writers on the website. This step makes sure that each author's credentials and expertise are very visible, which makes them more credible to visitors and search engines. We developed Person Entities for the entire team to reinforce the website's Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness (E-A-T). By linking these entities to their respective user pages on WordPress, we enabled search engines to collect comprehensive information about each author. This data is integrated into the structured data of their articles, adding another layer of authority to their content.\u00a0To further optimize and create a stronger entity presence, we created a Kalicube account for Express Legal Funding and Aaron in particular. This helped us to create uniform information across all of Aaron\u2019s websites and entities, and give the boost needed to get a Knowledge Panel. This can help AI ecosystems and search engines to better understand Aaron\u2019s entity. This ensures that search engines can accurately associate all relevant information with Aaron, improving his individual and overall online presence. As a result, Knowledge Panels appeared in Google search results, providing concise and informative snapshots of each author's background and contributions.&nbsp;Together with Aaron, we had many exciting learnings on this journey. It was evident how important it was for search engines such as Google to extract information to create a KP from a page that can be controlled &amp; managed by Aaron. By this, what we mean is how all relevant info tied to Aaron must be present on a dedicated page, such as an About Page, and how using structured data and consistent data across social profiles helps to disambiguate Aaron from others, make his entity stand out, and ultimately bag him a KP. Aaron\u2019s book also helped to disambiguate his entity from many others and make it truly unique. We utilized book schema markup to achieve the same.To further optimize the website's visibility, we built a comprehensive knowledge graph (KG) and established strong interlinks between the main website and the blog content. This strategic approach enhances the website's overall authority and facilitates the discovery and indexing of valuable information by search engines.In addition to the above efforts, we integrated Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) based on the \"People Also Ask\" feature. By addressing common queries related to our client's domain, we enhance the website's relevance and cater to the needs of users and search engines alike.When we analyzed the results consistently, we were able to find out using analysis that the pages where WordLift was implemented saw ~53% increase than the ones without it. This helped us to navigate our efforts in the right direction, and also measure the impact of our efforts.&nbsp;Overall, our combined efforts have significantly improved our client's Google E-A-T standing, increased the visibility of their website, and provided a more informative and engaging experience for their audience.Challenges &amp; Opportunities&nbsp;In the journey we made together with Aaron, there were two major challenges we encountered that made our work harder but also more exciting. I will tell you about them below.&nbsp;As we saw before, to get Aaron's Knowledge Panel, we started with Kalicube account and created consistent information about him across different profiles. We also created a Wikidata page with all the necessary info. We saw a basic Knowledge Panel appear for Aaron in no time, and everything worked great. Unfortunately, the page got deleted within a few weeks, and we lost the Knowledge Panel too.\u00a0We gathered all the information about the client in the structured data. We turned the \"AboutPage\" into an entity collector and went about building a coherent digital identity.&nbsp;Even then, since many people had the same name, search engines needed help to disambiguate Aaron's entity and identify him as a Legal Funding Expert.&nbsp;When Aaron published his book a few months later, we utilized this to distinguish his entity and establish him as an author. All his personal entities were updated to match this, and we got the Knowledge Panel back.&nbsp;Aaron continuously posts&nbsp; top-notch, original content that is helpful for readers and those seeking legal funding help. The growing traffic proves this. Another challenge to overcome was other websites plagiarizing the content on Express Legal Funding and ranking.&nbsp;These sites took a significant percentage of traffic until legal action was taken, and the infringing pages were taken down. The original content within the site is created after extensive research and efforts and is protected fiercely against copyright infringement.Results&nbsp;In June 2023, our efforts yielded remarkable results across different aspects of the business.&nbsp;Regarding traffic, there has been an important 48.8% increase in impressions and a 46.13% increase in clicks compared to the previous three months.The rise in traffic has been complemented by a substantial boost in editorial work.One notable achievement is the successful completion of the \"doxxing article.\" In this endeavor, we have found ourselves competing with major players like Avast and Kaspersky, targeting a highly competitive, short-tail term. Remarkably, our page's performance has been nothing short of outstanding, especially when compared to its published time. These results speak to the impressive E-A-T that Express Legal Funding has gained, as it was able to hop into another industry's topic, which it had never written about, and quickly rise to the top search engine rank positions.This article is now ranking not just for long-tail terms but also for the high search volume term \u2018doxxing\u2019 in the 5th position, also getting FAQ rich results. The traffic is also growing well when we compare over a 28-day period.&nbsp;Overall, these outcomes demonstrate the efficacy of our initiatives in driving traffic and optimizing content for improved search rankings and user engagement.\"Working with WordLift has been great for us at Express Legal Funding. It was the last missing key needed to get a Google knowledge panel for myself. The AI software has built upon the success I already had as an author establishing myself as a topical authority about pre-settlement funding. Since working with WordLift, the daily website traffic and quality of the leads we have received from Google have increased, enabling us to be more effective in our underwriting process, which is a top goal of a legal finance company.\"Aaron R.

        "text": "How to Improve PPC with Structured Data Table Of ContentHow Does Ai Affect Paid Campaigns?Performance OptimizationAd creation and ManagementHow Structured Data Can Make A Difference In PPCHow Does AI Affect Paid Campaigns?McKinsey Global Survey on artificial intelligence (AI) suggests that organizations are using AI as a tool to generate value. Increasingly, that value is coming in the form of revenue.&nbsp;As this data shows, AI for advertising allows you to increase your return on ad spend (revenue) and reduce the amount of money you spend on staff time and ineffective ad budgets.Suppose we take Google Ads as an example. Before using AI and then the automation that comes with it, you needed to invest a lot of time and effort in finding keywords, devices, targeting, messaging, and bidding to get more leads, sales, and subscriptions. Work that was being done manually by humans.&nbsp;Today, all this is outdated. With AI-based solutions, you can improve the efficiency of various aspects that affect paid campaigns, not only on Google Ads but on the various platforms available.&nbsp;Budget optimization and targetingPerformance optimization is one of the prominent use cases of artificial intelligence in advertising. Machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze ad spreadsheets and get tips on optimizing them, either by automating previously manual actions or highlighting issues you didn't know you had.&nbsp;In more advanced cases, AI can automatically manage ad performance and spend optimization, allocating budgets across channels and audiences and letting humans focus on more strategic tasks.&nbsp;Similarly, you can use AI to analyze audiences used in previous campaigns and optimize them based on past performance data. In this way, you can also identify new audiences interested in the business.Ad creation and managementThere are systems based on artificial intelligence that can create partially or completely ads for you based on your goals. This feature is already present in some social media advertising platforms, which use intelligent automation to suggest ads that you should run based on the links you are promoting.But it also exists in some third-party tools, which use intelligent algorithms to write the ad copy for you. These systems leverage natural language processing (NLP) and natural language generation (NLG) to create texts that perform well or better than the human-written copy.How Structured Data Can Make A Difference In PPCStructured data is crucial for organic search but equally decisive for paid campaigns.&nbsp;Structured data enrich your content with the information necessary to make Google and search engines understand what you are talking about. It makes your data more accurate and more appealing. This means that when you add structured data to your website, you enrich your dataset and, by using your first-party data, you push input into ad systems that are read correctly because they contain all the required attributes and allow you to get better performance from your paid campaigns.&nbsp;We asked Frederick Vallaeys, CEO at Optmyzr, a few questions on this topic. Frederick was one of the first 500 employees at Google, where he spent ten years building AdWords and teaching advertisers how to get the most out of it as Google's AdWords Evangelist.Specifically, I asked Fred, how you can use structured data to optimize feeds and ad components to have better results.&nbsp;\u201cAs Google Ads become more automated, the ways we optimize PPC are changing and structured data plays a big role in that. Rather than managing details inside the ads system, we have to shift towards managing the inputs into the ads system so that the automations can handle the details correctly.&nbsp;Think of ads for example. Advertisers used to write separate ads for every ad group but now with&nbsp; Responsive Search Ads (RSA), they can re-use the most powerful ad components across many ad groups while changing just a small subset of ad assets for each. In effect, ad text has become a form of structured data and in our analysis it can drive significant incremental conversions.&nbsp;One of our clients wanted to deliver automotive leads to their dealership clients at a lower cost. They had the structured data on the website. Through this and Optmyzr's Campaign Automator, they were able to decrease cost per acquisition (-25%) and increase ROAS. In addition, they could save over 50 hours per month by keeping prices, colors, and trim levels up to date for their automotive customers.&nbsp;There are many other ways in which structured data impacts search advertising, from Dynamic Search Ads (DSA), to shopping ads driven by merchant feeds, local ads driven by business feeds, dynamic ads driven by ad customizers, etc.&nbsp;Knowing how to feed better structured data into the automations will be critical for continued PPC success\u201d.[et_pb_section global_module=\"21007\"][/et_pb_section][wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

NLG is related to human-computer and machine-human interaction, including computational linguistics, natural language processing (NLP), and natural language understanding (NLU).Sophisticated NLG software can be trained on large amounts of data, large amounts of numerical data, recognize patterns, and information in a way that is easy for humans to understand.&nbsp;What is the difference between Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Natural Language Generation (NLG)?NLP (Natural Language Processing) uses methods from various disciplines, such as computer science, artificial intelligence, linguistics, and data science, to enable computers to understand human language in both written and verbal forms. NLG (Natural Language Generation) is the process of producing a human language text response based on some data input. So, NLP accurately converts what you say into machine-readable data so that NLG can use that data to generate a response.Originally, NLG systems used templates to generate text. Based on certain data or a query, an NLG system filled in the blank text. Over time, however, natural language generation systems have evolved to allow more dynamic, real-time text generation through the use of neural networks and transformers.How can NLG help improve SEO?Natural language generation has some incredible implications for your SEO strategy.&nbsp;By using NLG systems, more content can be created faster. Not only does this save time, but it allows website owners, especially in e-commerce, to create content on a large scale.&nbsp;However, when working with AI text generation for SEO, we need to be even smarter and more critical than usual. To create tangible and sustainable business value, we need to create workflows where humans collaborate with machines.&nbsp;This means that we should not (yet) use GPT-3 or other transformer-based language models by letting them run free. We need to keep \"control\" over content quality and semantic accuracy to avoid unwanted biases and prejudices. Within this workflow, humans have the main task of nurturing semantically rich data in Knowledge Graphs.The human side can be encoded in a knowledge graph. When we look at embedding the Knowledge Graph behind our blog for an entity like AI, the closest relationship in our small world leads us to SEO. Editors over the years have established this relationship between AI and SEO on our blog, and we can now use it to \"control\" content creation around one of these concepts.In WordLift, we have developed a sophisticated approach to AI-generated content where we move from initial data collection and enrichment to active learning where the model is improved and the validation pipeline is also improved. The workflow consists of 4 steps as shown in the figure below.To learn more about automatically generated content in SEO, I recommend you take a look at this webstory.What Google says about AI-generated contentGoogle's Helpful Content Update, released in August of this year, has reignited the discussion around AI-generated content and how Google is addressing it.&nbsp;Although not explicit, in the update Google confirms its aversion to AI-generated content and talks about content that is high quality and meets the needs of users, content that is written by people for people. Google wants to avoid low-quality content written for search engines and not for users.&nbsp;The reasons for Google's aversion to AI-generated content may be many, but the fact is that there are some truths to consider. The first is that AI-generated content performs well in search if it is of high quality. The second is that AI-generated content is still not easy to scale. Training the models is very tedious and there is still not complete confidence in the results obtained.&nbsp;So what makes the difference? What makes high-quality AI-generated content that does not risk Google (and user) penalties? The answer is simple: data. As Kevin Indig also said: The biggest differentiator will be what inputs (data) companies can use to create content. And that's where structured data comes in.&nbsp;Data-to-Text GenerationThe key is to build a large dataset that you can keep adding to and that can provide potential insights. GPT-3 will help you extract valuable insights from it.Daniel Ericksson, CEO at Viable.The crucial part of using NLG for AI-generated content in SEO is semantically rich data (that might also be beneficial for structured data). Language models trained on billions of sentences learn common language patterns and can generate natural-sounding sentences by predicting likely word sequences. However, when generating data in text, we want to produce language that is not only fluent, but also accurately reflects the content.&nbsp;Structured data makes this possible. They are semantically enriched so that they provide the model with the information and attributes that can make content generation more accurate. In the case of GPT-3, for example, any data is converted to text to make it more usable, but without the structured data and the information it contains, GPT-3 would confuse even the best prompts. If you use structured data instead, you can achieve better results and outperform the competition, which is very large in this area, considering how many open automated content writing tools are available online.Building a Knowledge Graph is essential for the effective use of NLG systems such as GPT-3. The Knowledge Graph is the dynamic infrastructure behind a website. It represents a network of entities - i.e., objects, events, situations, or concepts - and illustrates the relationships between them. Structured data is used to describe these entities. This way, your content is more easily understood by search engines and ranks better on Google.&nbsp;With the Knowledge Graph, you then have the semantically enriched dataset you need to train models and create unique and original AI-generated content that respects brand identity and tone of voice.Try our AI question answering tool to extract relevant questions from URLs and then automatically answer!AI-generated Content For SEO: A Real-World CaseHow We Used NLG For E-CommerceHere we would like to show you a real world case of how we used AI to create content that had a positive impact on SEO. In this case, we are talking about what we did for a corporation that includes some of the biggest international brands for accessories. So let us talk about AI-generated content for e-commerce.This experiment proves that customized AI Product Descriptions can bring measurable SEO value to product detail pages (PDP). With AI-generated content, each variant of the same product gets a personalized description, whereas with standard workflow, all variants share the same description.&nbsp;The experiment began a year and a half ago. In the first step of the workflow, we collected all the data we needed to better train and enrich the model. Thus:&nbsp;Product feeds to describe.Actual product descriptions or examples of product descriptions with the brand's ToV;Other content with the brand's tone of voice (e.g., social feeds).Brand kits and other materials related to the brand.Then we selected the attributes. These must be available in the dataset provided and relevant to the product. The list of selected attributes was used to create the prompt.&nbsp;To customize the model, fine-tuning is the way to go. We use the provided examples with product descriptions. This way, the content generated by the AI matches the products, brands, and tone of voice of the client. Once the prompt is ready, we can start creating the product description. The completion is renewed until we reach our goal that the product description is correct and validated in terms of number of characters (between 190 and 350). We will check the output with a native English speaker who will correct the generated text.The validation process is an important step in automating the verification of the attributes described in the compilations. This way we can check the product description to see if all attributes are correct or missing. Once the compilation is validated, we share the output with the internal teams involved in the project, who approve and possibly integrate the descriptions before they go online.An important step was to involve the internal editorial team from the beginning. Our goal is to improve their work, but they are the ones who have the rudder and need to be able to steer the boat in the right direction with the necessary adjustments.After some testing:We determined that we could have a consistent model across the group of sites, with TOV customized for each brand.We have improved the level of validation and are becoming more flexible in handling the content rules we receive from the editorial and SEO teams.Two key components are improving the quality of the data used to train the model and interacting with the content team.As for validation, experiments with StableDiffusion and DALL-E 2 can help validate the overall quality of the final description.With the first test conducted on one of the group's websites, we achieved a 43.73% increase in clicks. By looking at the increase in the sales, the team estimated a potential double digit growth of the annual revenues.&nbsp;Another test was performed on another site with a variant group compared to a control group. In this context, we saw a +6.19% increase in clicks. In this experiment, AI content was added to canonical URLs (which already contained a description).To learn everything you need to know about GPT-3 for e-commerce, read our article.&nbsp;How To Use NLG To Create SEO-Friendly ContentNLG applications use structured data and turn it into written narratives, writing like a human but at the speed of thousands of pages per second. NLG makes data universally understandable and aims to automate the writing of data-driven narratives, such as product descriptions for e-commerce.Content CreationContent creation is something that almost all e-commerce store and blog owners need to constantly invest in to produce fresh, high-quality content. Content can take many forms, including blog articles, product descriptions, knowledge bases, landing pages, and many other formats. Creating good content requires planning and a lot of effort.With the help of AI and natural language generation models, it is possible to produce good content while dramatically reducing the time it takes to create it.Remember that human monitoring, refinement, and validation remain critical to delivering excellent AI-generated content with current technology.Generate E-Commerce Product DescriptionsYou can use GPT-3 to generate product descriptions for e-commerce. Based on data provided to it during training, GPT-3 can predict which words are most likely to be used after an initial prompt and produce good human-like sentences and paragraphs. However, this is not an out of the box solution. To adapt GPT-3 to your specific needs and produce good product descriptions for your online store, you will need to go the fine-tuning route.&nbsp;If you want to learn more about using GPT-3 to create product descriptions, I recommend you read our article.Make your e-commerce 404 pages \u201csmart\"You can create a recommendation engine for your e-commerce that suggests products on the 404 error page. You can design the layout of the page using DALL-E 2 and create the error message using GPT-3. This way, your ecommerce 404 pages, which are among the most visited pages on your website, will help provide a relevant and optimal user experience.&nbsp;[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "Local SEO in 2023: 7 Simple Ways to Dominate Local Search As a local business owner, sometimes it feels like your back is against the wall when trying to compete with global brands. You're working with a limited geographical reach and\u200c an even tighter budget. But what if you could take what seems like a disadvantage and flip it into your secret weapon?That's exactly the magic of local search. So, this is your sign to use your local focus as a strength (not a weakness) and level the playing field with the big dogs. In this article, we'll explore seven simple ways to dominate local search, helping you climb to the top of Google's first page and drive organic (digital and foot) traffic to your business. Let's dive in\ud83d\udc40Table of content: What Is Local SEO?How to Dominate Local SearchMake Your Google Business Profile AwesomePerfect Your Local Keyword ResearchPublish a Robust Library of Local ContentAdd Specific Location Pages to Your WebsiteLeverage Local Structured Data MarkupMake Your Website Mobile FriendlyVet Your Information Using Local Citations and Business DirectoriesWrapping UpWhat Is Local SEO?Local search engine optimization (SEO) is a tried and true strategy to help increase the online visibility of businesses in a specific geographic area. The goal? Convert traffic into paying customers.Local SEO is particularly relevant for small and medium-sized businesses that operate on a regional level \u2014 rather than a national or global scale. In other words, it should be your go-to marketing strategy as a local business.Here's a simple example of what a local search looks like on Google:Screenshot by Jeremy Moser.So, how does Google determine local rankings? It focuses on three key elements:Relevance: how well a local Business Profile matches search intent.Distance: how far each result is from the location of the searched keyword.Prominence: how well-known the business is to residents or visitors.With these elements at the forefront of your local SEO strategy, you can appear on the first page of Google in two different ways: in the local pack or in organic search results.Here's the difference:Screenshot by Jeremy Moser.The local pack displays Google Business profiles and a Google Map. The pack appears below \u200csponsored ads but above \u200corganic search results.Organic searches are those blue hyperlinks that we know and love. In a non-local Google search, these tend to be our go-to sources for information.&nbsp;In fact, after analyzing over 4 million search results, Backlinko confirms that the first result on Google scores an average click-through rate (CTR) of 27.6%.In the SEO world, any CTR above 3% is a homerun. So 27.6% is considered a world series title.How to Dominate Local SearchIt's time to roll up your sleeves and boost your traffic. Here's a roadmap to kickstart your local SEO journey.1. Make Your Google Business Profile AwesomeThink of your Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) as your digital storefront.It's one of the first things users see when they search for services or products in your area, so giving it the attention it deserves is key to standing out. Oh, and Google mentions it's one of the most important tasks on the local SEO checklist. So don't skip this step.Here are a few simple tips for optimizing your business profile:Claim your listing. If you haven't already, create and claim your Google Business Profile to take control of your business's online presence.Provide accurate information. Include all the vital details like your business name, address, phone number, website, and operating hours. Don't forget a brief description.Add high-quality images. A picture is worth a thousand words. Include high-resolution images of your products, services, or even your team to give potential customers a visual insight into what you offer.Encourage reviews. Reviews act as social proof, building trust with potential customers.Screenshot by Jeremy Moser.2. Perfect Your Local Keyword ResearchKeyword research is the cornerstone of any effective SEO strategy. If you're unsure what your target audience is searching for, how can you cater to their wants and needs?Start by identifying who your local customers are and what they're actively searching for. What terms or phrases will they type into Google when looking for your products or services in your niche?For instance, let's say you own a flower shop in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. You'll need to identify the specific needs and interests of your local Fort Lauderdale customers seeking floral arrangements.Here's an example of how you can identify terms or phrases they might use:Target customers: individuals celebrating special occasions (like anniversaries, birthdays, or weddings), businesses needing regular floral arrangements, people expressing sympathy or love, flower enthusiasts, and holiday shoppers.Search intent: fresh flowers in Fort Lauderdale, wedding bouquets, birthday flowers, sympathy arrangements, local flower delivery, and seasonal blooms.Potential terms or phrases: By clearly outlining your audience and their specific needs, you might target keywords like:\"Fort Lauderdale florist\"\"Fort Lauderdale flower shop\"\"Wedding flowers in Fort Lauderdale\"\"Same-day flower delivery in Fort Lauderdale\"\"Flower shops near me\"Once you have a rough idea of the terms your target customers are searching for, you can leverage SEO tools like Ahrefs, Semrush, and Google Search Console to understand the monthly search volume and keyword difficulty (KD).These tools can also \u200cinspire you with other keywords to target by looking at matching or related keywords. Here's an example of related terms for \"fort lauderdale florist.\"Screenshot by Jeremy Moser.Pro tip: If this is your first time performing keyword research for a new website, look for long-tail keywords with at least 100 monthly search volume and a keyword difficulty under 20.These criteria will give you the best chance of ranking in the search results, as the big players aren't likely to target this low-hanging fruit.And remember that keyword research is only the first step in the long game known as local SEO. You'll need to strategically incorporate these keywords into your website and Google Business Profile for search engines to find you (and recommend you).So take a page from Watermill Flowers' book for stellar on-page SEO. They incorporate variations of the Fort Lauderdale florist keyword throughout titles, meta descriptions, and product pages.(Image Source)That's exactly what search engines are looking for. And it helps the user instantly know they've landed on the right website page for their search intent.Follow this same method for your own website, and say hello to higher traffic and conversions. Music to any business owner's ears.3. Publish a Robust Library of Local ContentContent is king. In fact, at least 70% of marketers use content marketing in their overall marketing strategy.And with a 91% success rate (according to Semursh), it's worth dedicating time and effort towards content creation. What is the best way forward? Writing more content and publishing it more often.(Image Source)By focusing on building a library of local content, you're doing more than optimizing for search engines \u2014 you're connecting, engaging, and becoming a vital part of your community.This approach helps your local SEO strategy and sets you apart as a business deeply embedded in the local culture. It's a powerful way to dominate local search and forge lasting customer relationships.So how do you go about weaving your business into the fabric of the local community? Use these simple tips:Identify local topics of interest. Find out what your community cares about. Are there local events, cultural traditions, or seasonal considerations relevant to your business?Create blog posts and expert guides. Focus on informative blog posts and guides that address these local interests. Whether it's a guide to the best dining options in your area or tips on buying a house in your state, these resources can position you as a local expert.Keep content fresh and updated. The local scene is always changing, and so should your content. Regular updates, new insights, and timely articles keep your content library fresh and relevant.Balance evergreen and time-sensitive content. Cater to immediate local interests while also providing lasting value. Striking a good balance enhances your position in local and regular search results.Feature local insights and stories. Share success stories, testimonials, or insights from local customers or clients. Real experiences resonate with local audiences and add authenticity to your content.Now, let's look at an example in action. Young and the Invested has generated 173,000 monthly organic traffic to its website.Screenshot by Jeremy Moser.The key to their success?Prioritizing on-page SEO best practices like adding keywords to meta descriptions.Finding the optimal equilibrium between evergreen and time-sensitive content.Publishing expert guides that help young people improve financial literacy.Featuring local stories and insights to spark community connections.The result? A spot at the top of Google's coveted first page for the competitive keyword \"debit cards designed to help teens.\"Screenshot by Jeremy Moser.By following a similar approach and targeting appropriate keywords, your business can enhance its online visibility and attract potential customers specifically searching for your products or services.Remember, selecting the right keywords and optimizing your meta descriptions can substantially impact your local SEO success.And if you're ready to publish dozens of articles per month to achieve the same success as Young and the Invested, let Wordable do the heavy lifting for you. You can export Google Docs to WordPress with one simple click.(Image Source)And you'll never lose the on-page SEO efforts you've worked so hard to incorporate. A true win-win scenario.4. Add Specific Location Pages to Your WebsiteIf your business serves multiple locations, adding specific location pages to your website is a must. Think of each page as a unique digital storefront tailored to a neighborhood or area.(Image Source)Start by creating individual pages for each location. Add \u200cunique details like your address, phone number, hours, and even specific offers or testimonials from that community.Don't forget to optimize these pages with relevant local keywords that reflect the particular area, such as \"best BBQ restaurant in [neighborhood name].\"And if you really want to stand out, take your static images up a notch and try adding video and live-stream productions to these pages to showcase the local vibe.With pre-recorded videos, you can share behind-the-scenes details on how you created an award-winning menu. Or you can give a tour of a new restaurant that's about to have a grand opening.With a live video stream, you give your audience a real-time update on crowd levels and the current vibe to entice people to join the festivities. Or you can host virtual happy hours with special guests. The options are endless!(Image Source)Videos are worth over a thousand words and can amplify your community's voice. Plus, it's a fun and unique way to put a face to your brand. And stand out from the other local business vying for attention.5. Leverage Local Structured Data MarkupThink of structured data markup as speaking the search engines' native language.Adding structured data to your website helps Google quickly understand and present your business information in local search results. And you have a better chance of appearing in those prized rich snippets.Oh, and this markup doesn't just improve your visibility. It enhances the user experience by providing concise and relevant information right where your customers are looking for it (read: right place, right time).If all of this technical jargon went straight over your head, you're not alone. Thankfully, WordLift has harnessed the power of AI and can do all of this for you. The best part? It doesn't require any technical knowledge.(Image Source)You can sit back, relax, and watch WordLift improve impressions by 85%. That's not a drop in the bucket. And you didn't have to do any of the heavy lifting. What's not to love?6. Make Your Website Mobile FriendlyMobile optimization is a vital part of the local SEO puzzle \u2014 especially in light of the growing swarm of mobile users relying on \"near me\" searches. You must roll out the red carpet with a mobile-friendly user experience to capture this on-the-go audience.Speed is the name of the game. We're all busy people, and we (sadly) don't have the patience to wait for slow pages to load. So keep things as zippy as possible.Thankfully, the Google PageSpeed Insights tool spells out everything you need to do to help speed things up. Paste in your website URL and hit the analyze button. Within a few seconds, you'll receive a passing or failing score. If your website passes, you're off to the races.If you fail, don't worry. Fix the issues that Google highlights and try again.Screenshot by Jeremy Moser.An intuitive user interface (UI) also plays a significant role in mobile optimization. A clear and easy-to-navigate UI helps your mobile users find what they need without the hassle.This simplicity translates into visitors sticking around on your website and taking the actions you want (making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter, etc.). Plus, nobody likes a cluttered, eye-straining mess. It's confusing and one of the easiest ways to lose trust in a brand.And last (but certainly not least), adding features like click-to-call buttons and optimizing your Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) are key touches in this mobile-friendly mix.Screenshot by Jeremy Moser.Click-to-call buttons simplify the process for mobile users to reach out to your business, increasing conversion opportunities. And a well-maintained Google Business profile with accurate information can boost your standing in local search results. It's a win-win.7. Vet Your Information Using Local Citations and Business DirectoriesAs the saying goes: garbage in, garbage out. It's the number one rule when you learn how to clean data.And accurate data about your business is of the utmost importance to Google. Here's a direct quote from their page on how to improve your local rankings:Local results favor the most relevant results for each search. Businesses with complete and accurate information are easier to match with the right searches.You can vet that your business information is accurate in two key ways. You can verify your business with Google.(Image Source)Or you can leverage local citations and business directories to signal to Google that your business information is accurate.Sometimes these are called \u200b\u200bNAP citations or online mentions of your business's name, address, and phone number (NAP).\u200b\u200bWhy are NAP citations important? Google uses them to confirm the accuracy of your business details. They help cross-reference the information you present about your business online and ensure it's genuine.For example, you might see a NAP citation on a site like Tripadvisor:(Image Source)The principle here's straightforward: the more Google encounters consistent NAP citations with your information, the greater its confidence that your business is authentic and reliable.So, your goal should be to secure consistent citations across as many reputable websites as possible.

SEMANTIC SEO: The Semantic-aware SEO workflowAuthor: Alexander Rodrigues SilvaKey TakeawaysThis book was born from the author's desire to document his experience in search engine optimization and the insights he gained while studying librarianship at the University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Taxonomies, ontologies, and SEO are three elements born to coexist. But before delving into the beautiful world of semantic SEO, you need to know more about what website optimization was like before using semantics, and this book will help you do that.The process described in this book, the semantic SEO workflow, increases the relevance of published content by providing metadata that generates meaning and semantically links data. This process helps resolve ambiguities when answering a query with a specific search intent.[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "Fine-Tuning GPT-3.5: Unlocking SEO Potential with Structured Data IntroductionThe GPT-3.5 Turbo model by OpenAI has been a game-changer as it democratized access to large language models on an unprecedented scale. At WordLift, we've been intensively investing in fine-tuning these language models to meet the unique needs of our enterprise clients. Our focus is on enhancing the quality of the generated content and ensuring that it aligns seamlessly with an organization's core values, tone of voice, and content guidelines.In this blog post, we'll delve into the fine-tuning process of GPT-3.5 Turbo and explore how surprisingly simple it can be, particularly when integrated with WordLift's knowledge graph or any existing structured data.Jump directly to the Colab \ud83e\ude84https://wor.ai/fine-tuning-demoThe Imperative of Fine-Tuning for SEOWhile the base GPT-3.5 Turbo model is incredibly versatile, it often serves as a generalist rather than a specialist, particularly in the nuanced field of SEO. Fine-tuning The Fine-Tuning Process. Fine-tuning solves this challenge by allowing us to train the model on specific data sets. This enhances its ability to generate optimized content and ensures that it resonates with your organisation's unique style, tone, and guidelines, much like an in-house writer would.The Fine-Tuning ProcessFine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo is straightforward and I added a few parameters to make the  process customizable. You can directly jump to the Colab Notebook; here are the steps:Data Preparation with WordLift:GraphQL Query: We start by using a GraphQL query to extract content from our blog. Since this content has already been marked up with Schema, the query will return a curated selection of articles.Segmentation and Chunking: Next, we segment these articles by looking at the headings and apply a chunking method, as described in the code, to prepare the data for training. You have the option in the code of adding multiple sentences (4 is the default value) within each chunk, right after each heading.Data Validation and Token Estimation:Before proceeding, we use a function provided by OpenAI to validate the prepared data and estimate the total number of tokens in our training dataset.API Calls for Fine-Tuning:With the validated and token-estimated dataset, we then use OpenAI's API to fine-tune the model.Quality Testing:For the initial evaluation, we take a comparative approach. We generate content using a given prompt for both the fine-tuned model and the standard GPT-3.5 Turbo model. By analyzing the output from both, we can assess how well the fine-tuned model aligns with our SEO and content quality standards, as well as how it maintains the unique style and guidelines of your organization. We will also use the fine-tuned model in the context of a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that uses WordLift LangChain / LlamaIndex connector.A Python script provided by OpenAI to find potential errors, review token counts, and estimate the cost of a fine-tuning job.SEO-Centric Use Cases and WordLift's Content Generation ToolContent Generation: Produce SEO-optimized product descriptions, introductory text for category pages and many SEO programmatic tasks where you can use structured data in your prompts.Keyword Analysis: Generate keyword-rich content that aligns with search engine algorithms and your written content. Dynamic Link Building: Automatically create and manage internal links for SEO optimization, as our blog post explains.Beyond these use cases, the fine-tuned model can be seamlessly integrated into a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that I have built using the WordLift connector for LlamaIndex. This allows for even more advanced SEO-centric applications, such as contextual query answering, content generation and semantic search optimization. Testing the new fine-tuned model with RAG and LlamaIndexHere are a few examples demonstrating how the newly-created model operates within an Agent. This Agent is built using LlamaIndex and Chainlit, a Python framework designed for constructing conversational user interfaces, and it's integrated with the knowledge graph of this blog.We can add in Chainlit the option to choose different models for our RAG Agent, this is a quick way to validate the results of a fine-tuned model with different queries.WordLift new Content Generation toolOne of the most exciting applications of our fine-tuned models is their integration with WordLift's new content generation tool. This tool leverages the capabilities of the fine-tuned model to produce high-quality, SEO-optimized content that aligns perfectly with your organization's unique voice and guidelines. For more information on how to make the most of this innovative tool, check out the WordLift Content Generation Documentation. We'll dive deeper into a next blog post!Code update \ud83d\udd25: taking the fine-tuning one step furtherI have added a new section in the Colab where you can explore a different approach to fine-tuning. We start, also in this case, from content marked up as a schema Article, but, this time, we use\u00a0Llama Index, a robust framework for interacting with large language models, and the WordLift Reader (a connector for Llama Index) to:Extracting documents from the Knowledge Graph (KG).&nbsp;Creating a dataset of questions using ChatGPT 3.5 based on the articles from the blog.&nbsp;Utilizing GPT-4 to answer the generated questions using an index of all the pieces.Here, we can see the process of generating synthetic questions that will be answered to create a new fine-tuning file.Incorporating Llama-Index into the fine-tuning process adds another layer of sophistication, enabling us to create a more accurate content generation system.Once again, multiple strategies can be combined to find the best mix of samples for a given website.ConclusionFine-tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo, particularly when integrated with WordLift's knowledge graph or any other structured data, opens a new era in SEO optimization and content creation. Structured data markup not only serves as an invaluable resource for preparing the training dataset but also aids in quality validation, minimizing the model's potential for generating inaccurate or \"hallucinated\" content. A few key findings emerged from this initial experiment:Minimal Training Examples Needed: Unlike with previous GPT models, we found that only a few training examples are needed to get started. The model's robustness can be scaled up as we progress; I observed noticeable differences even with just 50-100 samples.Strategic System Prompts: Given that we're dealing with a chat model, the role of the system prompt becomes strategic, especially during the fine-tuning process. I've added a feature in the Colab notebook that allows you to configure the system prompt according to your specific use-case.Enhanced Nuances in RAG Systems: When the fine-tuned model is used within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, it receives additional context. This makes the model more adept at detecting subtle nuances in the content.Looking ahead, OpenAI has announced that fine-tuning capabilities for GPT-4 will be available later this year, offering even more opportunities for SEO-focused customization. The future is indeed promising!If you're interested in learning more about how to leverage structured data for content generation, we invite you to contact us. Stay tuned for more exciting updates on Generative AI for SEO!It's worth mentioning that the allure of creating your customized ChatGPT model does come with a financial consideration. While fine-tuning itself may not break the bank (as costs are relatively limited), it's important to be aware that the token costs for inferencing on a fine-tuned model are eight times higher than those for the standard model![wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]ReferencesHere is a list of a few relevant articles:\"OpenAI Lets Developers Customize GPT-3.5 Turbo with Fine-Tuning\" on Search Engine Journal\"GPT-3.5 Turbo Fine-Tuning and API Updates\" on OpenAI Blog\"Dynamic Internal Links in SEO\" on WordLift Blog\"Knowledge Graph and LLM\" on WordLift Blog\"Preparing Your Dataset for Fine-Tuning\" on OpenAI Platform Docs\"WordLift's Content Generation Tool Documentation\" on WordLift Docs\"Fine-Tuning GPT-3.5 Turbo: A Costly Mirage?\" on Jina AI Blog ",

        "text": "Artificial Intelligence Artificial Intelligence (often shorten with A.I.) is a field of computer science and research which aims to develop intelligent machines, computer systems, and agents able to perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence.What is intelligence, anyway? The Stanford University defines it as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world\". In an article written in 1950, Alan Turing discussed the conditions for considering a machine to be intelligent: according to his work, when a\u00a0machine could pretend to be human to an actual human, then it certainly should be considered it intelligent.Is this enough? Well, it is arguable. In 1998 Daniel Dennett\u00a0implemented various Turing's tests and it turned out that some people are easily led into believing that a rather dumb program is intelligent.[wl_navigator]How can artificial intelligence help writers?While NLP (natural language processing) is evolving into NLU (natural language understanding), we are facing a huge revolution in writing and - especially - web\u00a0writing. Artificial Intelligence is already able to write news stories starting from different sources, edit articles and review their grammar and wording, quickly scan articles to find relevant information. These technologies are going to simplify the repetitive tasks for content writers, helping them focus on what they care most: writing good stories, suggesting to their readers well-informed opinions, and writing critics and comments.On the other side, the semantic web is feeding search engines with meanings and data, which help them compute information, interpret users' intent, and serve them with the most fitting and useful results. Google's machine learning algorithm, RankBrain is a bright example of how quickly search engines are evolving in this scenario.If you are interested in this topic, read this article by Ben Dickson about the impact of AI on professional writing.How is WordLift using AI?WordLift uses NLP, which is an intersection between AI\u00a0and linguistics, to suggest content editors relevant information, images and links by analyzing the pages and articles they write.To be more specific, WordLift uses Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) to extract Named Entities from textual contents. Editors can reconcile entities extracted from their posts and pages with equivalent entities available on other sources.In this way, WordLift helps machines (such as computational search engines, personal assistants, and more) unambiguously interpret the context to whom the content belongs.\u00a0Jeff Dean, Senior Fellow and SVP at Google announced the introduction of\u00a0Pathways: a new AI architecture multi-tasking, multi-modal, and more efficient.Pathways will handle thousands or millions of tasks, understand multiple types of data, and do so with remarkable efficiency. It will move us forward from the era of single-purpose models to one in which more general-purpose intelligent systems reflect a deeper understanding of our world and adapt to new needs.To find out more about\u00a0Google Pathways, check out our Web Stories\u00a0here.[wl_navigator]",

Once you have trust, selling your products and services will be easier.Of course, building a relationship through content takes a lot of time and effort, and here is why you'll betterWhy a blog is&nbsp;an excellent&nbsp;media for content marketingA research produced in 2023\u00a0by Content Marketing Institute and Marketing Profs state that\u00a090%\u00a0of marketers use blogs to distribute their content\u00a0\u2014 and, even more importantly, 60% of the most successful marketers think that a blog is one of the most effective formats.If you have a WordPress website, creating a collateral blog and start producing content is quite an easy job. The hard part is to understand which kind of content is more effective for your marketing goals. Here is a list of types of content that can be useful for your readers and that usually work.Case studiesTell your audience the results generated by your product or service. Collect results and use storytelling to make your clients' success stories more interesting and easier to understand.Tip: to make your case studies more engaging, put the light on your customers and their success either than on your product or service.Ebooks and whitepapersCollect your experience and knowledge into downloadable ebooks and whitepaper and share them for free. Useful content will help your&nbsp;brand turn into a trustable friend.Tip: ask your readers to opt-in your mailing list in order to download your content. It's a fair price for a useful content, and it will help you build a tighter&nbsp;connection.How-TosIf you have a know-how, share it with your audience. Tell them exactly how to do something, step by step. Even if it's a simple process, someone maybe is looking for how to do it for the first time.Tip: remember your first time and be as detailed as possible. Consider that there are a lot of marketers out there who use how-tos to attract readers: differentiate your content crafting the most accurate&nbsp;article out there.InfographicsSimplify the knowledge around a specific topic building a visual overview on it. Good infographics are very appreciated on social media channels: share it on yours.Tip: reach out other bloggers and influencers in your niche, asking them to share your work.

        "text": "Accelerated Mobile Pages What is AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages)?AMP is an open source library that allows developers creating web pages that load almost instantaneously on mobile browsers. It has been launched by Google and adopted by giants of the web publishing industry such as The Guardian and the CNN, top social media websites such as Twitter, and world famous e-commerce&nbsp;websites such as eBay.In this 6 minutes video, Paul Bakaus, Developer Advocate at Google, explains AMP in plain words. Have a look!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBTCB7yLs8YTechnically speaking, AMP pages are built with 3 core components: AMP HTML (which is basically HTML with a few restrictions that can guarantee better performances), the&nbsp;javascript library AMP JS, and AMP cache.Why is AMP so important?Speed is the crucial factor that AMP aims to optimize. In fact, a great page speed is what can really make the difference between a poor and an excellent the user experience, especially on mobile devices.When a web page takes too long to load, most of the users will&nbsp;abandon it&nbsp; - and, for sure, those who have the patience to stay don't engage with the website and its content as much as they could if it the pages were loaded faster.Why? Today users navigate mostly via&nbsp;mobile devices. Just to make an example, iPhone users log into their smartphones about&nbsp;80 times a day for super short sessions that last 30 seconds on average. Yep, 30 seconds.If you had 30 seconds to spend reading web content, how long would you wait for a webpage to load?Well, according to Google, 53% of the users leave web pages after 3 seconds of loading. The reason is obvious: hanging there in front of a loading web page looking at a tiny display is frustrating. You really feel you're losing your time and therefore you most probably choose to lose that specific piece of content and maybe go and look for something similar that is not that slow.Consider that 75% of mobile websites need more than 10 seconds to load, and you'll get the measure of the issue, here.In this context, AMP pages that can load instantaneously are a godsend. On one hand, they will help you build a compelling user experience&nbsp;lowering the friction of the loading time and still offering the user the same exact content and actions. On the other hand, AMP pages help you distribute your content, allowing it to be featured on the news carousel and appearing between the first results on the SERP.This is not just a matter of UX: it has been demonstrated that websites that load in 5 seconds have 2x the revenues of those which load in 19 seconds. Look how page speed impacts the bottom line of these three well-known brands in terms of revenues, conversions, and traffic.0.1 second is worthed 1.2 billions per year! That's huge!&nbsp;Since Google started&nbsp;rolling out its mobile-first index, having AMP pages has become even more important for SEO rankings - you can't really postpone its implementation anymore.How can you furtherly optimize your AMP pages?If you have already implemented AMP pages on your website, chances are that you are looking to optimize them even better.Lucky you! We've recently written an article about optimizing AMP pages&nbsp;using schema.org markup. Enjoy!",

        "text": "Google Web Stories: Everything You Need to Know What are Google Web Stories?Web Stories are an extraordinary visual storytelling format that can help you make your Google results irresistible.Inspired by the stories available on various social media, Google Web Stories offer users a fully immersive, swipe-based, full-screen experience. This innovative visual format allows you to combine text, audio, video, images and animations to create a slideshow to explore a specific theme from a multisensory perspective.Web Stories (formerly AMP Stories) are a fast-loading technology designed for mobile devices and based on full-touch interactions. It's an accessible (open web) format, and anyone can use them on their website to build engaging and inspiring visual narratives. In addition, sharing Web Stories is effortless, really affordable for everyone!Where do Web Stories show up on Google?Let's focus now on SEO. One of the most exciting aspects of Web Stories is, in fact, the potential for organic visibility on mobile.Web Stories can appear:Google Search results;Google Images results;Google Discover;Google App.Why are Web Stories useful to your content marketing and SEO strategy?Here's how Andrea Volpini, our CEO, answered this question:\u201cFor your best-positioned articles, Web Stories are like trailers for movies: a thoughtful selection of \"shots\" through which to inspire your readers and entice them to dig deeper. Google will trust your Web Story because your article (or your web page) on that topic has already been assigned a good ranking. Also, there is no risk of cannibalization, if anything, the opposite. The Web Story is connected with the article, and Google does a fantastic job contributing to both\u201d.&nbsp;&nbsp;Andrea Volpini (source)In other words, using Google Web Stories provides more exposure for your site and your articles. They can be shown in different positions on Google: as a rich snippet in SERPs, as a Web Story Grid, on Google Discover, and among Google image results. The benefits of this format don't end there. Let's analyze them together.Content OwnershipUnlike social media stories, Web Stories are embedded on your site and are owned by you. This gives you more freedom and control over your content.User EngagementWith Web Stories, you can create a truly interactive and immersive experience to attract and engage your audience on your website.No Time LimitUnlike social media stories (and certain Google content, such as Google My Business posts), Web Stories have no time limit or expiration date. Once published on your site, they will stay there as long as you want :)MonetizationGoogle has made available new ads formats based on web stories. Have fun trying them out!External LinksWeb Stories can receive incoming links from any site and can, in turn, contain a link to any web page.KPIsWeb Stories support Google Analytics and all types of Google tracking.Live StoriesWith the \"live stories\" attribute, you can notify your users that you have added a new Web Story. Very useful for bloggers and media people.How to create your first Web StoryAre you eager to jump into the fray and work on your first Web Story?Awesome! Let's take a look at how to do it.Depending on your skills, you can choose one of two ways:If you're not a developer and want to focus primarily on content and design, you can use a third-party tool like MakeStories or Newsroom AI. If you use WordPress, Google's Web Stories Editor is a great choice \ud83d\ude09On the other hand, if you are a coding expert, you can do it yourself by following the guidelines and tutorials on the AMP website.The Google plugin for WordPressSEO tips for your Web Stories: what Google wantsThrough Web Stories, Google wants to provide users with interactive and engaging content that can increasingly \"position\" the search engine as a source of inspiration and discovery, in a push and no longer (only) pull perspective.Google Stories tickle users' curiosity, so for Google, they represent the perfect bait to capture readers through interest-based content.10 examples of inspiring Web StoriesWatch this video to discover 10 captivating Web Stories selected directly by Mr Google!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLJwFYbpkqI&amp;t=1sGoogle's technical guidelines for Web StoriesTo appear on Google, Web Stories must follow a set of guidelines provided by the search engine itself. Here are some of the requirements to keep in mind to help your visual content succeed in SERPs:1) CompletenessMake sure that your Web Stories are genuinely complete, that they tell a story in its entirety and that they are not overly commercial. So avoid building Web Stories where users have to click on links to get essential information or Stories that contain more than one external link or attachment per page.2) AffiliationIf you use affiliate links in your Web Stories, our suggestion is not to exaggerate: limit yourself to a single link per Story. Also, be careful to respect the Quality Guidelines for affiliate programs.3) Story LengthWe recommend that you create Web Stories between 5 and 30 pages. Even better if they are between 10 and 20 pages \ud83d\ude014) Title lengthUse short titles! Our suggestion? Stay under 40 characters.5) TextWrite less than 200 characters on each page. Focus each slide on a single idea, like a social post.6) VideoVideos can give movement to your Story, but be careful, don't overdo it! The ideal would be a video of 15 seconds per page (and never more than 60 seconds). PS. don't forget the caption.Our experience with Web StoriesLast year we published our first Web Story on one of our articles... and it was the biggest hit of the year! The page saw a spike in organic traffic of +540%.If you want to learn more, we recommend reading the article on creating an SEO-friendly Web Story and our other successful experiences boosting organic traffic using this format.Clicks generated in one week on Google Discover with the Web Story on SEO Trends 2021And now... get to work!Google gives a lot of exposure to Web Stories, so it's time to start experimenting with this format.Web Stories can create a bridge between Google and your web pages.

        "text": "Measuring SEO effectiveness using Causal Impact Analysis If you are an SEO, you constantly struggle to measure your strategy's impact in the most precise and irrefutable way; Causal Impact, a methodology originally introduced by Google, helps you exactly with this. In this blog post, I will share a Colab notebook that will help you, starting from data coming from the Google Search Console (GSC), to run a Causal Impact Analysis. I present you in the code two options:download data from GSC and upload it on Google Sheetsget data directly from GSC using the APIs and a great library by Josh Carty \ud83d\ude4f. When following this option, we will also be able to provide a list of URLs for which we want to run the analysisThe data on Google Sheet linked in Colab is related to a LocalBusiness markup optimization task. What is Causal Impact Analysis?It\u2019s a statistical analysis that builds a Bayesian structural time series model that helps you isolate the impact of a single change being made on a digital platform.Let\u2019s say you have decided to improve the structured data markup of a local business and you want to know how this particular change has actually made impacts on traffic that we see coming from Google.This sounds simple because you could just compare the measures before adding the new markup and after the change. But, it\u2019s actually hard to measure in the real world because there are so many attributes that could influence the end results (e.g. clicks from Google). The so called \"noise\" makes it hard to say - yes, this actually has created a positive impact.Google had the same problem and Kay Brodersen and the team at Google built this algorithm called Causal Impact to address this very challenge and open-sourced it as an R package. In the code I provide you here I am using a library called pycausalimpact developed by William Fuks \ud83d\ude4cLet's look at the code 1. Install libraries Installing pandas, numpy and causalimpact and the library to access GSC2. Download data from Google Search Console and publish it using Google Sheetspublishing the CSV downloaded from GSC using Google Sheets (Dates.csv is the file we need)3. Download data using GSC APIRemember that this is an alternative step to the previous one but it has the advantage that will allow you to selectively choose the URLs that you wish to analyze. In order to get access to the data in GSC we will need to go through the authentication process. Getting access to GSC APITo access the Google Search Console API, you\u2019ll need to create the Google Developer Console credentials. As it\u2019s quite a detailed process, I suggest you follow the&nbsp;awesome SEO, Jean-Christophe-Chouinard. Jean has detailed the instructions and you can follow&nbsp;his guide.Reminder #1:&nbsp;the user interface in Developer Console changes with time so that navigation elements might change; however, you must follow the steps described in the link above. Reminder #2:&nbsp;Please note that you should be logged into the Google Developer Console with the same Google Account you\u2019ll want to access Google Search Console.When done, download and save a JSON copy of your \u201cclient secrets\u201d file from the Google Developers Console, it\u2019s also a good idea to keep a copy of this file somewhere for safekeeping on your hard drive as you can reuse it for all your work with GSC API in the future.GSC AuthenticationAdd the domain name as you see it in the list of connected domains in the form, also. Add the number of days for which you will need to extract the data. For example, to get the data from the last 60 days, we will write -60.Setting the domain name and the time frameIn the step below we can paste the list of URLs that we want to analyze. Just remember this will be a comma separated list of urls. Add here a list of urls (i.e. https://wordlift.io/blog/en/linked-data, https://wordlift.io/blog/en/structured-data, ...) 3. Plot dataHere we only want to make sure we're getting the right data into the analysis. Plotting Clicks and Impressions4. Configure pre and post periodsHere you will need to be careful and configure the dates before (pre_period) and after (post_period) the change.Keep in mind that CI will create a prediction by analyzing the data in the pre_period and it will subtract the prediction from the post_period to see the actual impact.  4. Run the analysis and get the responseWith a few simple instructions you will get:the graphical response as well as the detailed summary of your experiment in written form.

Such programs are often designed to engage in small talk with the aim of passing the Turing test by fooling the conversational partner into thinking that the program is a human. However, chatterbots are also used in dialog systems for various practical purposes including customer service or information acquisition. Some chatterbots use sophisticated natural language processing systems, but many simply scan for keywords within the input and pull a reply with the most matching keywords, or the most similar wording pattern, from a textual database. The term \"ChatterBot\" was originally coined by Michael Mauldin (Creator of the first Verbot, Julia) in 1994 to describe these conversational programs.",

For this reason, to take full advantage of this tool on a website, it is important to take care of the pages of the entities and to provide a useful definition in the first few lines, but which can also stimulate the user to go further and visit the entity's page. .",

        "text": "Semantic Publishing Semantic publishing\u00a0or dynamic\u00a0semantic\u00a0publishing, refers to\u00a0publishing\u00a0online documents along with the linked metadata that describe them.\r\rAdding machine-readable metadata helps crawlers and software agents\u00a0to understand the meaning, structure, and context of a piece of information.\rWhat is Semantic Publishing?\rIt was back in 2001 when Tim Berners-Lee in\u00a0a publication of Scientific American\u00a0that later became a milestone for the Web industry first introduced the term\u00a0Semantic Web.\rThe Semantic Web will bring structure to the meaningful content of Web pages, creating an environment where software agents roaming from page to page can readily carry out sophisticated tasks for users [.....].\u00a0The Semantic Web is not a separate Web but an extension of the current one, in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation.\rThe limitations of the Web as a collection of\u00a0documents and links\u00a0have been well known for quite some time.\r\rWay before the WWW was born - back in 1960 - a visionary called Ted Nelson introduced\u00a0the idea of a\u00a0\"digital repository scheme for worldwide electronic publishing\". Nelson\u00a0introduced a machine-language program which would store and display documents, together with the ability to perform edits.\r\rWhen in the 80s Berners-Lee began structuring the WWW as we know it today, a rivalry emerged: Nelson had a strong and justified reaction when Wired magazine published in 1995 a controversial article titled \"The Curse of Xanadu\". \r\rNow - without getting into too many details - one of the differences between WWW and Xanadu, the system that Nelson envisioned, is that information from one document can be embedded into another document (a mechanism known as \"transclusion\") with explicit permission given by the author of the document. This mechanism of sharing information in a consistent way between parties was lost with the implementation of hyperlinks and HTML web pages that we use today.\r\rWeb pages have been originally designed to display information for humans and had little or no information to help machines process, sift and organize this information. Hyperlinks also have been originally conceived as free pathways from one document to the other without requiring any specific logic and/or approval by the linked party as it was with Xanadu's transclusions. \r\rThe Semantic Web addresses these concerns and extends the World Wide Web by\u00a0making information machine-readable, specifying\u00a0provenance and allowing software agents to automatically accomplish complex tasks\u00a0such as text mining, categorization, and search. The linked metadata introduced by semantic web technologies also helps search engines understand the content being indexed and provide more accurate results to their end-users.\r\r Hyperlinks are an essential feature of the World Wide Web but provide no meaning on why two pages are connected. A machine when analyzing a\u00a0hyperlink can only see that the first page is promoting the second one and is using a specific keyword to enable the link. There is no way that the machine can grasp why that link was created and by whom. The Web is a large graph of connected pages made of unspecified links.\r\r\r\rIn the Semantic Web each node has a unique identifier and the relationship with the other nodes helps computers\u00a0understand the meaning and the structure of the content. In semantic web publishing, the nodes are represented by core concepts or entities that are unambiguously connected\u00a0with shared definitions, accessible to everyone on the Internet. \r\rWait a second where is this information stored? \r\rEntities are stored publicly on the Web\u00a0using a set of best practices\u00a0for publishing and connecting structured data\u00a0known as linked data.\u00a0Linked data entitles several techniques\u00a0to help machine analyze\u00a0content, index it and fetch answers back to users. In semantic publishing, the metadata describing an article is stored using linked data. \u00a0\u00a0\rWhy large media companies invest in Semantic Publishing?\rIt has been quite some time since large online publishers have begun advocating semantic publishing.\u00a0Web publishing is going through a significant transformation and the driving forces of this transformation are:\r\r \tMobile users are on the rise and content is consumed contextually and on-the-go\r \tThe attention span is shrinking. In a recent consumer research study, Microsoft claims that the average human attention span is down to 8 seconds, down from 12 seconds in 2000\r \tLong formats have become popular online and have negatively impacted advertising metrics. They are more expensive to produce and generate less engagement in terms of page views.\r \tSEO is a must and machines have become more demanding in terms of the metadata they require, editors, are challenged by the evolving algorithms and content marketing techniques.\r \tSocial Media are driving more referral traffic than search engines. Initiating conversation online and nurturing the audience requires ready-to-use actionable\u00a0information\r \tFake news are\u00a0undermining the work of journalists.\u00a0In world where \"everyone is a publisher\" true journalists strive to remain authoritative voices. Professional journalists often become\u00a0prey of all kind of manipulation.\u00a0\r\rIn this context semantic publishing represent a concrete solution to tackle these challenges.\u00a0Here are some of the reasons:\r\r \tMore compelling and authoritative content can be created with the help of semantic publishing\r \tContent, published with semantic markup, drives more engagement (have a look at one of our use cases to see how\u00a0dwell time and organic traffic have been increased) and helps users discover content more quickly\r \tSearch engines promote semantically marked up content in various ways as they can better understand the context of it.\u00a0Google Rich Snippets are an example. Several studies demonstrated how Rich Snippets boost\u00a0CTR on SERP pages by 30%\r \tLinked metadata provides completely a new way to craft a personalized reading experience with meaningful recommendations and a logical linking structure\r \tThe editorial productivity in small to mid-sized editorial teams is increased as entities become a shared knowledge base within the newsdesk\r \tThe structured metadata allows publishers to package content in easy to us\u00a0API-driven feeds (here is a simple example of a feed containing all the persons we talked about in this blog). \r \tSemantic publishing enables the most contextually relevant ads that match articles, therefore, increasing CTR on advertising and business value.\u00a0\r \tSemantic publishing reduces the amount of manual work required by editors by automating tagging, linking, SEO tasks and categorization.\r \tAs content is sliced and categorized using concepts and topics new interactive ways of interacting with it are presented to the user. Topical pages (such as the one you're reading now) represent a new interactive glossary and replace traditional tag pages adding widgets to discover new content (see the example below).\r\r\rHow does Semantic Publishing work?\rThere are three major components in a semantic publishing architecture:\r\r \tText mining. The\u00a0technology required to extract information from a text written using natural language.\r \tA graph database. This is the repository of all the semantic information. Typically structured in a graph (triple store) the databases uses linked data technologies and stores information in triples (a data structure made of\u00a0three components: the subject, which is a\u00a0URI reference or a blank node. the predicate, which is a\u00a0URI reference. the object, which is a\u00a0URI reference, a literal or a blank node).\r \tA content discovery engine. This provides the data to discovery widgets and search engines to help users find the content they want to read.\r\rWordLift helps you structure content by extracting named entities and concepts and linking them with publicly available Linked Data graphs along with your custom datasets. The extracted data is stored in a triple store and injected as JSON-LD using the schema.org vocabulary for improving the SEO of the content.\r\rWordLift enhances articles and pages by using several NLP tasks including:\r\r \tLanguage Detection\r \tNamed Entity Recognition\r \tNouns Recognition\r \tEntity Linking\r \tTopic Annotation\r \tContent Classification\r\rAre You Ready to Give Semantic Publishing a Try?

        "text": "E-commerce SEO: how to drive organic traffic to your store What is SEO for e-commerce?When we talk about SEO for e-commerce, we mean the set of actions that aim to make an online shop more visible in the results pages (SERP) of Google or Bing.To influence the visibility of an e-commerce site is primarily the position within the SERP. If your site or your products appear at the top of the results page, it is much easier for users to buy from you.Why is it essential to take care of the SEO of your e-commerce?SEO is essential for your online store because, as we said, it makes your site visible to users who are looking for products like the ones you sell. In other words: you can have the best e-commerce in the world, but if no one knows you exist, it won't be easy to do business!Working on the SEO of your e-commerce has other benefits as well. Thinking about your website in terms of SEO can help you make it more transparent, provide complete information, and simplify the process of choice and purchase for your users.If the store is easy to navigate, if users have no doubts about using the products, if you can answer all the questions that could stop people before the fateful moment of payment, users will be more likely to trust you and buy to the joy of your turnover \ud83d\ude01How can you improve the SEO of your e-commerce?To get more organic traffic to your shop, you can work on two fronts:On-page SEOOff-page SEOOn-page SEO includes all those actions that you can implement directly within your website. Central will be the choice and use of keywords in titles, meta titles, meta description and in all the textual content of your pages (including product pages). On-page SEO is the crucial difference between you and your competitors, and it is from here, you must start to get noticed by users.On the other hand, Off-page SEO is about those activities you go to show the search engine that others rated your store positively. This is why the ultimate off-page activity is link building. When search engines detect a link to your shop within other authoritative websites with a good reputation, part of that authority is transferred to you. Let's say it's a bit like getting a good recommendation!Similarly, if you receive links from dubious and suspect websites, some of that bad reputation will fall back on you, leading to a decrease in your authority and visibility.Social media also plays a significant role in off-page SEO, despite not being a direct ranking factor. Links to your site shared via social can be judged as authoritative inbound links, with all the benefits we just discussed.In addition, social profiles can position themselves on the Google or Bing results page and become entry points on a path that leads users to your shop.Finally, we must consider that more and more people search for the products they need directly within social platforms. So we can say that social media are turning into real search engines!How to improve the SEO of product pagesOptimizing your product pages is essential for your products to appear in a good position in SERPs. Several factors can affect the ranking of a product page on the store. Here we try to summarize the principal elements and give you some valuable tips to increase your ranking.1) Write an exhaustive title and description of the product.&nbsp;Considering the search intent of your users, you provide all the information needed to get people to complete the buying process.2) Optimize images and videos.Make clever use of the headline and ALT text at your disposal.3) Include customer reviews.Testimonials from previous buyers can convince potential customers and will make them trust you more.4) Add related products.&nbsp;A section with suggested products can guide people to discover items that are similar or related to those they've already targeted and thus increase the value of the cart.5) Add the FAQ section.&nbsp;Adding a section with Frequently Asked Questions can solve the most common doubts that stop users before purchasing.SEO for e-commerce: advanced toolsNow it's time for the real pro tips. Do you know what is better for the organic visibility of your online store? Structured data. You may have heard them referred to as schema markup as well.Structured data allows you to communicate with Google by \"speaking its language\". If you use this metalanguage, you can ensure that Google accurately categorizes all the information about your products and content.Adding structured data to your e-commerce means getting an immediate boost in organic visibility, as well as much more exciting and magnetic previews in SERPs for users, such as rich snippets.To learn how structured data can make your shop pop in the SERPs, we recommend this article.And if you want to understand how to use schema markup for your e-commerce, you can talk to our experts!Book a Demo[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "An SEO Passport for your Products: the Unique Product Identifier Providing accurate, high-quality product data to search engines helps your customers have a smooth shopping experience and enables you to improve your products' visibility via free product listings and ads on search engines such as Google and Bing. Google has lately re-stated the importance of accurate product listing and correct use of unique product identifiers (UPIs).&nbsp;What are Unique Product Identifiers (UPIs)?Global Trade Item Numbers (GTINs), Manufacturer Part Numbers (MPNs), and brand names are all examples of UPIs. A UPI is a number or code that uniquely identifies the product in the eyes of the customer. A UPI helps us identify a specific type of product or a colour variation for that product worldwide.What is a GTIN, and why are they so important for Google?GTIN is the acronyms for Global Trade Item Number and is an identifier for products, developed by GS1; a standard organization focused on business communication.While Amazon uses its unique identifier within its network called ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number; a 10-character alphanumeric unique identifier assigned by Amazon.com), Google, since 2015, has been using GTIN for product identification. The main advantages being:Each code is unique - across an entire value chain, a specific product will always have the same GTIN code;Using GS1 and accredited global registers, there is always a way to check where each product is coming from;It works globally. A product created in Australia, when sold in Italy can always be \u201crecognized\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing you should know is that a GTIN consists of a combination of 12-13 or 14 numbers and letters and has incorporated other standards such as ISBN (International Standard Book Number), IAN (International Article Numbers), UPC (Universal Product Codes) and many others product identifiers.&nbsp;Let's take, for example, the GTIN for the Diet Coke 600ml bottle sold in Australia. This product has the following GTIN: 9300675009775 and this translates in the barcode below.Behind this GTIN/barcode, we can immediately learn new things about the product.For example, we can see that the product was manufactured in Australia by a Coca-Cola branch and that the plastic bottle contains 600 ml of Diet Coke.GTIN, besides barcode, can also be encoded in an QR-Code/EPC/RFID tag. By scanning the barcode/QR-Code or EPC/RFID tag, companies can efficiently and accurately process products and related information. Read more about GTIN on the GS1 website. What product identifiers are used by eBay?eBay, much like Google, uses an item\u2019s brand, manufacturer part number (MPN), and global trade item numbers (GTINs) for product identification. Here is all you need to know about eBay and UPIs.&nbsp;Why is a GTIN important for the SEO of your E-Commerce?GTIN provides accurate and rich product information to Google, Bing and other marketplaces. You can feed product information using both Structured Data and Google Merchant Center (the platform Google uses to ingest product data from retailers) or Microsoft Merchant Center. When you add a unique GTIN for each of your products, it will be much easier for Google and other marketplaces to match your products with other sellers' products. This will also make it easier for potential buyers to find exactly what they're looking for.&nbsp;When adding GTIN information to all your product pages using structured data markup, you effectively help search engines connect searcher for that specific product with the content on your web page. Let\u2019s look at another example this time starting from Google\u2019s SERP.Here we have a pair of Oakley sunglasses that appear when using GTIN code 888392335937 directly in Google\u2019s search. If we look at the Shopping tab, we immediately see the associated product information page from Oakley. Now, if we look at the structured data behind this page on the Oakley website, we find the same GTIN that we used in Google\u2019s search \ud83d\udc47.What if I don't have a unique product identifier for all my products?If you are a manufacturer of the product you can get your unique product identifier from GS1 directly - here is how. Alternatively, you can of course create your own codes and adopt a proprietary product identification system using unique Stock Keeping Unit numbers (SKUs) or Manufacturer Part Numbers (MPNs). As you can imagine, adopting a global standard like GTIN makes things a lot easier. If you are reselling products created by others, then it is best to check the manufacturer's website to see the correct product identifier.&nbsp;Can GTIN become accessible as a Web URL?Yes, GS1 Digital Link standard has been created to extend the power and flexibility of GS1 identifiers by making them part of the web. If you\u2019re adding a QR code or NFC tag to a product, using the GS1 Digital Link standard means sharing the same data you have on your E-Commerce site in the physical world.Can I share structured data in the physical world? How?We call it Physical SEO and it is the way to link product metadata, commonly used on the&nbsp; E-Commerce website, with the real world. Using GS1 Digital Link we can bring the same information that we publish using structured on the product\u2019s barcode (NFC or QR-Code).&nbsp;We do this by adopting GS1 standard to turn a GTIN code, like the one used for the Holbrook sunglasses, into a Web Address.&nbsp;Here are the HOLBROOK\u2122Here is the GTIN: 888392335937And here is the product data behind their Digital LinkImagine a GS1 Digital Link as a companion for the product that carries the same information that we have on the E-Commerce site.[et_bloom_locked optin_id=\"optin_7\"] Read more about GTIN and GS1 Digital Link for your omnichannel marketing here.&nbsp;&nbsp; [/et_bloom_locked]If this is something you would like to talk about in more detail, drop us an email.

        "text": "What are embeddings? In natural language processing the goal is to have machines understand human language. Unfortunately, machine learning and deep learning algorithms only work with numbers so how can we convert the meaning of a word to a number?This is what embeddings are for. Teaching language to computers by translating meanings into mathematical vectors (series of numbers). Word embeddingsIn word embeddings, the&nbsp;vectors of semantically similar terms are close to each other. In other terms, words that have a similar meaning will have a similar distance in a multi-dimensional vector space. Here is a classical example - \u201cking is to queen as man is to woman\u201d encoded in the vector space as well as verb Tense and Country and their capitals are encoded in low dimensional space preserving the semantic relationships.Knowledge graph embeddingsWe can use the same technique used for words also for analyzing nodes (entities) and edges (relationship) in a knowledge graph. By doing so we can encode the meanings in a graph in a format (numerical vectors) that we can use for machine learning applications.  https://wordlift.io/blog/en/?post_type=post&amp;p=18740You can create graph embeddings from the Knowledge Graph that WordLift creates by reading the article above.In the following presentation, I introduce the concept of multidimensional meanings using a song from \"The Notorious B.I.G.\", undoubtedly one of the biggest rappers of all time. The song is called What\u2019s Beef?\". In the text of the song, there is a play on the homophones \u201cI see you\u201d and \u201cICU\u201d which is the acronym for intensive care unit most interestingly the word Beef assumes different meanings in every sentence. As we can see meanings change based on the words of each sentence. The idea that meanings can be derived by the analysis of the closest words was introduced by Firth, an English linguist and a leading figure in British linguistics during the 1950s.  Firth is known as the father of distributional semantics a research area that develops and studies theories and methods for quantifying and categorizing semantic similarities between linguistic items based on their distributional properties in large samples of language data.&nbsp;It is using this exact framework (studying semantic similarities between terms inside a given context window) that we can train a machine to understand its meaning. Cosine similarity When we want to analyze the&nbsp;semantic similarity&nbsp;of two documents (or two queries), and we have turned these documents into mathematical vectors, we can use&nbsp;the cosine of the angle&nbsp;between their respective vectors.The real advantage is that two similar documents might still be far apart when calculating the Euclidean distance if they use different words with similar meanings. We might have, for example, the term \u2018soccer\u2019 that appears fifty times in one document and ten times in another. Still, they will be considered similar when we analyze their respective vectors within the same multidimensional space.&nbsp;The reason is that even if the terms used are different, as long as their meaning is similar, the orientation of their vectors will also be similar. In other words, a smaller angle between two vectors represents a higher degree of similarity.Embeddings are one of the different techniques we can use to analyze and cluster queries.

        "text": "Entity What is an entity in the Semantic Web?In the Semantic Web an entity is the \u201cthing\u201d described in a document. An entity helps computers understand everything you know about a person, an organization or a place mentioned in a document. All these facts are organized in statements known as triples that are expressed in the form of subject, predicate, and object.Take for example an article on the Chinese invasion of Tibet that refers to the prophecies that [Thubten Gyatso] made twenty years before the invasion. [Thubten Gyatso] as a string is composed by two separate words but as an entity it has a much richer meaning. [Thubten Gyatso] is a person, more specifically he\u2019s the 13th Dalai Lama who was born in the Tsang-\u00dc province in Tibet on the 12th of February 1876. In the context of Semantic Web, an article annotated with the entity of [Thubten Gyatso], conveys all this information about the 13th Dalai Lama in a way that computers can understand it and, as you might suspect, computers might not be too familiar with the history of Tibetan Buddhism.Every document on the Web is about many different kind of \u201cthings\u201d. Entities describe content using knowledge models known as graphs that help computers \u201cthink\u201d the way we do and that help us, in return, find information more efficiently.Entities are linked to one another. Each entity holds the information required to provide direct answers to questions about itself (i.e. \u201cWhen was&nbsp;Thubten Gyatso born?\u201d) and questions that can be answered by looking at the relationships with other entities (i.e. \u201cWas Trinley Gyatso his predecessor?\u201d).What is an Entity in WordLift?Entities in WordLift are web pages that describe the \u201cthings\u201d that we talk the most in our website. All the entities are organised in a vocabulary within WordPress. Each entity is a web page and corresponds to a data point that WordLift creates in the web of data.WordLift publishes entities and their properties in an intelligent model \u2014 technically called \u201cgraph\u201d \u2014 designed to help computers understand real-world \u201cthings\u201d and their relationships to one another. The graph is published using linked data and it is used, in WordLift, to enrich all content published on a website.Let\u2019s take this page as an example. This is the entity page to describe what entities are. You are reading content from this webpage, a hypertext document that is connected to the World Wide Web. At any time a crawler, a smart agent or a chatbot can read this same information by looking at the structured data that WordLift has created for this entity.While humans can read a web document, for a computer is way easier to read semantically-rich data linked to other data published in openly available datasets.How is an entity different from an article or a web page?WordLift uses Entities in three ways:Entities describe the \u201cthings\u201d that you talk about in your articles using 5-stars linked data so that search engines can unquestionably understand what you\u2019re writing aboutEntities help organize the content that you\u2019re writing. As you annotate an article with an entity, WordLift creates a relationship between the article and entity in such a way that a computer can understand it. These relationships are stored in the graph of the website and are used to provide meaningful recommendations to your readersEntities provide contextual information to the audience. Take for example Linked Data - this is a concept that I used in this article and you might not be familiar with. In this case, WordLift helps me create a link so that you can find out more what linked data is and avoid jumping on another website to get the same information.Entities have to be relevant to the content that you\u2019re writing and in a way define your content strategy and the knowledge domain you\u2019re addressing with your website.What are the guidelines for creating new entities to annotate a blog post or a page?A basic guideline for adding a new entity is:\u201cI should create entities that a librarian would plausibly use to classify the content I am writing as if it was a book\u201cIn some cases key concepts that are important for our audience are not automatically detected by WordLift. In this case, we can create them and teach WordLift - as well as search engines, so that they will be able to recognise them in the future.Let me give you an example. When a new concept was introduced to describe PASO an acronym for Personal Assistant Search Optimisation, I created a new entity on this website and described it using structured data with WordLift.As you can see in the video below, the entity, after few weeks, became a featured snippet. By doing so Google Home was able to provide a simple definition of PASO using the content from this same website.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAHmR7tPggII have already several articles that could be used to organize the content on my website, can I turn them into entities?Yes, you can now convert your existing articles or pages into entities with a simple click. This helps you reuse your cornerstone articles to reorganize the content on your website and improve the search rankings of these pages. Cornerstone articles are usually meant to describe the \u201cthings\u201d you care the most and are a perfect match for becoming entities.&nbsp;How Can I Link Entities With One Another? &nbsp;According to Schema.org the sameAs property is: URL of a reference Web page that unambiguously indicates the item's identity. E.g., the URL of the item's Wikipedia page, Wikidata entry, or official website.It is like you're saying to the search engine \"this is the same thing as the one you find at this address.\" Today only between 10,000 to 50,000 domains use this property. That is also why you can make a difference for your SEO strategy by using it.However the sameAs property alone might not be enough if you need to query the data that you\u2019re publishing (or simply if you want others to query the data that you\u2019re publishing across multiple datasets). You need something more. You need to publish data following the so-called five-stars open data scheme introduced by Berners-Lee, that requires you to link every piece of data with other data.Here is where the owl:sameAs property comes into play.How Can you Link Entities from your WordPress Site to the Linked Open Data Cloud?Imagine we want to explain to a search engine Matt Mullenweg is and link the page I have for him on my blog with entities in the LOD cloud. How do I do that on my WordPress website?As you can see above, I used WordLift within my WordPress to create a page about Matt Mullenweg. That page is set up as a Schema Entity Type \u201cperson\u201d. To make it clear who I am talking about I run a search using WordLift that taps into giant graphs published in LOD and in a snap I can get the reference to the entity of Matt Mullenweg on Freebase, Wikidata, and DBpedia. Once I update the page, the Schema sameAs, and the owl:sameAs properties are automatically added by WordLift and made available to search engines.We can now use the Structured Data Testing Tool of Google to see how the search engine sees the page:The structured data has been created without writing a single line of code and now Google can crawl and index that page way more efficiently. However, there is also more to it.Now my data is interoperable with other datasets and published also off-page in an RDF-based knowledge graph.

        "text": "Google Knowledge Graph What is the Google Knowledge Graph?\rThe Google Knowledge Graph is a system added to Google Search and launched by Google on May 16, 2012. It is a knowledge base to provide more useful and relevant results to searches using a semantic-search technique. Knowledge Graph Panels have been added to the SERP of Google to provide links to external websites, general information (such as locations, reviews, opening hours etc.) and direct answers to questions. Information embedded in the Google Knowledge Graph is extracted from multiple sources, including structured data encoded in web pages using Microdata and JSON-LD formats.\r\rThe primary function of the Google Knowledge Graph is to learn about general facts of the world, organize these pieces of information together and understand how they can connect with each other. These ideas and information are organized into entities, each presenting different kinds of information and how each piece of information embedded within it can connect to another entity. For example, if you look up the search query \u201croman forum,\u201d you will find a knowledge panel that provides a plethora of relevant information about the ancient forum. This includes things such as: photos, reviews, the option to buy tickets online, operating hours, an address and even related search queries of other major attractions in the city of Rome like the Trevi Fountain and the Pantheon. For Google to understand the Roman Forum as an entity, it connects it to other entities like Rome (as a city), Ancient Rome (as a subject), Place (as a visitable location), as well as a\u00a0 LocalBusiness (where you can buy tickets, attend events and has operating hours).\r\rThese entities and the Google Knowledge Graph\u2019s use of these entities are not only a means for Google to organize this information, but it\u2019s also essential in presenting this information on mobile results and through voice search. The Google Knowledge Graph organizes this information not only to be informational but conversational as well. On mobile, this information can be delivered in a more presentable and easier to digest manner than a series of blue links and small text. For voice, a user can tell Google, \u201cBook three tickets to the Roman Forum and Colosseum for next wednesday.\u201d Google can understand what the user is asking by knowing that the \u201cRoman Forum\u201d and \u201cColosseum\u201d are both attractions and local businesses as well as that next wednesday means April 17th. From there, Google can take this information to complete a task or ask the user for more information or clarification if not enough has been provided.\rFrom \"strings\" to \"things\": Google's endless quest for clarity\u00a0\rNo one really knows for sure when and why languages arose in human history. As British anthropologist, Robin Dunbar suggests, language may have emerged to allow humans to build, foster and maintain relationships. That is what the \u201cGossip Hypothesis\u201d states. Whether or not this theory holds true, we cannot deny that we live in a world filled with small talk. Yet, through chit-chatting we strive for clarity. When we ask a question, we don\u2019t want answers. We want the answer! That is what Google Knowledge Graph has been attempting to do since 2012. If out of the blue I say \u201cyou\u2019re like Socrates,\u201d chances are you\u2019ll be thinking about the greek philosopher. Yet if I said that while playing soccer with my friends that would change everything. Why? Because Socrates + Soccer = Brazilian soccer player That may sound trivial for humans as we do it naturally, but not for search engines!\r\rThe Google Knowledge Graph leverages on the relationships between words and concepts to understand the context, thus assigning a specific meaning to a word.\r\r\rHow to get on the Google Knowledge Graph\rTo get your entities embedded in the Google Knowledge Graph, you will need to establish an online presence and become an authority on your subject. Establishing an online presence is easy, such as creating website content with structured data, registering your site with Google My Business and Search Console and any other important platforms such as Facebook and YouTube. To become an expert on your subject (in the eyes of the Google Knowledge Graph Team), create content using keyword research and structured data. Doing these can help Google create entities using your content and the knowledge you\u2019ve provided.\r\rGoogle has introduced a new way for any person, brand, company, organization, sports team, event and media property with an existing Knowledge Panel, to get verified and to suggest edits to the information presented by Google. It is a very simple process and the most direct way to suggest edits that will be added to the Google Knowledge Graph.\r\rYou can start by clicking on the phrase that starts with \u201cDo you manage the online presence for\u00a0xyz?\u201d\r\rHow to claim your entity on Google\r\rYou will be required to share with Google your social profiles (by taking a screenshot of the browser window where it appears you are logged in) and a photo of yourself holding an identity card. Once this step has been completed, the The Google Search Team will verify the information and\u00a0\u00a0you will receive an email from them (mine arrived after two weeks)\u00a0that will allow you to keep the data on Google always up to date.\r\rThe email from The Google Search Team after being verified.\rUpdating your entity in the Google Knowledge Graph\rOnce you\u2019re on the knowledge graph, you will be able to click the Suggest an edit link (or suggest edits if on mobile) at the top of the knowledge panel and from there click the information that you want to change and propose the changes. In the response box you shall write a short description that:\r\r \tClearly state your suggested change\r \tExplain why your suggestion is correct and should replace the existing content\r \tInclude a publicly accessible URL that confirms your suggested change\r\rIf there are multiple changes or suggestions you\u2019d like to make, make sure you submit the necessary feedback for each change you plan on making.\r\rYou can update your featured image\u00a0and some of the properties being displayed accordingly to each entity type (read here for more information).\rThe Google Knowledge Graph Search API\rThe Google Knowledge Graph Application Program Interface (API) enables you to find entities embedded within the Google Knowledge Graph using schema.org markup.This can be used to: get a ranked listing of notable entities in a certain criteria, completing entities in a search box, and annotate/organize content. The API can be found in Google\u2019s API explorer.\r\rUsing the API to find entities is relatively easy. Providing information for the different strings can help you find the thing you\u2019re looking for. For example, if you\u2019re looking at the knowledge cards for british monarchs, you can fill out the strings for the query \u201cPope\u201d and the type \u201cperson\u201d to find information about Pope Francis, previous Popes, the Vatican and the Catholic Church. The API then provides data on all the different, relevant entities that exist for the Pope.\r\rFinding entites on the Google Knowlede Graph Search API.",

A seminal paper introduced in 2017 by the Google Research team (\u201cAttention is All You Need\u201d) introduced a new neural network architecture for natural language understanding called transformers that can generate high quality language models with significantly less time for training.I worked on a presentation for Brighton SEO to get you started with Transformer-based language models:[Presentation] - SEO Automation Using GPT3 and Transformer Based Language Models Slides&nbsp;[Colab] - Code to understand how things work behind the scenesThese models have been harnessed to tackle a wide range of problems, from open-ended conversations to solving math problems, from poetry to SEO tasks like writing product descriptions. Generative AI comprises, alongside text generation, other abilities that a powerful new class of large language models enables: from writing code to drawing, from creating photo-realistic marketing materials to creating 3D objects, from producing video content to synthesizing and comprehending spoken language with an unprecedented quality.This blog post provides an overview of Generative AI and how it can potentially be used in the context of SEO.I have been generating synthetic images for almost two years with diffusion based models. Our team here at WordLift creates thousands of AI content snippets every month, from product descriptions to FAQs, from short summaries to introductory text. We actively collaborate with companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Jina AI to scale these workflows for our clients (SMEs and enterprises).&nbsp;Satya Nadella and Sam Altman from Open AI during Microsoft Ignite 2022 (WordLift is there!!)Here is the table of content, so you can skim through the article:Generative AI: the uncanny ability to generate\u2026everythingIntroducing Generative AI for SEOAI-Powered SEO WorkflowsText modelsInternal linksFAQ generationProduct descriptionsSummarizationIntroductory textStructured Data automationChatbot\u200b\u200bCode modelsText to Regex Text to Structured Data Image modelsSuper ResolutionVisual InferenceGenerating Product ImagesVideo models Speech models3D models Generative AI strategyThe flywheel of SEO success Anatomy of the perfect promptGetting started with prompt engineering Fine-tuning the models - the cover experiment The feedback-loop is King (or Queen or both)How can we help creators interacting with an AI model? Future workWhat is a Data Fabric? Credits and special thanksIntroducing Generative AI for SEOOne way to look at the evolution of Generative AI is to map key innovations in the field of LLMs and see how they can be potentially used in specific SEO workflows.Below, I highlighted the foundational models that can have an impact in the different areas of SEO (from entity SEO to programmatic, from Google Lens to 3D Serps) and the potential workflows that we can build on top.&nbsp;Generative AI for SEO landscape.AI-Powered SEO WorkflowsText ModelsThis is where the state of art is the most advanced, and the adoption is increasing faster. Models are incredibly diverse, and each one has its characteristics, but generally speaking, depending on the workflow, you can either start with a simple prompt (also called zero-shot), provide a more elaborate set of instructions (few-shots training), or fine-tune your model. Here is how you can use generative models that work with text.Internal LinksIn SEO, internal links remain a valuable asset as they help search engines understand the structure of a website and the relationships between different pages. They also help to improve the user experience by providing a way for users to navigate between the different pages. We can take into account semantic similarity, entities and what people are searching on our website to make these links effective. Here is a blog post about automating internal links for eCommerce websites using LLM.FAQ GenerationAdding content in the form of questions and answers has become a great tactic in SEO. As Google becomes more conversational, questions and answers marked up with structured data provide searchers with more relevant content in various contexts: from the people also ask block to FAQ-rich results, featured snippets, and even the Google Assistant.An example of automated FAQ for a luxury brand.Workflows here have become highly sophisticated and take advantage of multiple AI models to help editors in the different areas of the work: from researching the topic to planning, from writing the answer to reviewing it, adding internal links, and validating the tone of voice.Product DescriptionsLanguage models are perfect for creating high-quality product descriptions for eCommerce websites to fuel sales. The short form and stylized nature of product descriptions are an ideal fit when combined with the time and cost pressures on editorial teams working on thousands of products daily. The game-changer when creating product descriptions using models like GPT-3 by OpenAI or J1 by AI21 is the vertical integration of product data and the ability to craft UX patterns for fast feedback loops.&nbsp;SummarizationStarting in 2019, I began using BERT-like models for automating the creation of meta descriptions. We can quickly summarize a lengthy blog post. Can we help editors accelerate their research by summarizing the top search results? The impact of text summarization in SEO is enormous.&nbsp;How WordLift uses extractive summarization to improve the UX on blog posts.Introductory TextCan we describe the content of a category page using a fine-tuned LLM? Is it possible to personalize content to make it more likely to be of interest to a specific target audience? Generating short form content is a great way to use foundational models.Structured Data AutomationGraph enrichment is becoming essential to gain new features in the SERP and to help search engines understand the content and the relationship between entities. From named entity recognition to topic extraction, we can turbocharge schema markup with the help of RoBERTA, spaCY, and the WordLift NLP stack.ChatbotLLMs are becoming strategic in conversational AI or chatbots. They have the potential to provide a better understanding of conversations and context awareness. One of Google\u2019s engineers was even (wrongly) convinced that an LLM like Google LaMDA could be considered conscious. SEO is an important aspect when creating a conversational experience. Why? As we work extensively to train Google with question-answer pairs, we can re-use the same data (and the same methodology) to train our own AI system.The chatbot on our documentation website (on the left) extracts answers from the blog post (on the right) and helps users find the right information. It works like a search engine and like every search engine, SEO is a blessing.One way to provide contextual information when constructing an AI-powered conversational agent, such as a shopping assistant, is to combine the structured world of knowledge graphs with the fluent, context-aware capabilities of language models (LMs). This fusion, which we call neurosymbolic AI, makes it possible to transform the user experience by creating personalized conversations that were previously unthinkable.We have developed a new connector, WordLift Reader, for LlamaIndex and LangChain to transform static and structured data into dynamic and interactive conversations. With only a few lines of code, we can specify exactly what data we need by extracting from our KG the sub-graphs we want. We do this by using specific properties of the schema.org vocabulary (or any custom ontology we use).The connector uses GraphQL to load data from the KG, this ensures conversations are always up-to-date with the latest changes to the website, without the need for crawling.The following example is a shopping assistant built using this approach. As can be seen, the combination of multiple schema classes helps the AI to respond to multiple intents:schema:Product to recommend productsschema:FAQPage (on this site) to answer questions about the store's return policy\u200b\u200bCode ModelsThey are already having a significant impact on developers\u2019 productivity, as demonstrated by a recent study by GitHub. Developers feel more fulfilled when they use AI in pair-programming mode. There are still several concerns about IP violations that models like GitHub Copilot introduce, and too little has been done to address these problems. Nevertheless, also in the SEO industry, they are starting to play a role.&nbsp;Text to RegexOne very simple use case is to convert plain english to regex to help you filter data in Google Search Console. Danny Richman got you covered and if you want to learn more here is his recipe.&nbsp;Text to Structured DataI trained the first model a couple of years ago using GPT-2 and right now using Codepilot things are getting a lot simpler. These solutions are very helpful to sketch the JSON-LD that you would like to get.&nbsp;Image ModelsGenerative AI models for image generation are revolutionizing the content industry. We have seen AI-generated images going viral in only a few months and even winning fine art competitions. Each model has its unique touch; you will get more fantasy-like images from Midjourney and more realistic results from DALL\u00b7E 2 or Stable Diffusion. All models share the same understanding of the world, and this is encoded into CLIP, a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training by Open AI trained on a vast amount of (image, text) pairs. CLIP can be instructed to analyze the semantic similarity between an image and a text. If you genuinely want to understand how AI models for generating images work, CLIP is where to start.Here is an introductory Colab that you can use to see how CLIP works (powered by Jina AI):[Colab] - Code to experiment with CLIP&nbsp;Super ResolutionOne very simple thing to do, in the context of SEO, is to use AI models to increase the resolution of images associated with blog posts or products. &nbsp;SEO image optimization, especially when combined with structured data, helps increase click through rate.&nbsp;Here is a blog post and the code to get you started with image upscaling:[Blog Post] - AI-powered Image Upscaler&nbsp;[Colab] - Code to upscale images in batchesVisual InferenceImagine the potential to automate extensive evaluation on large product catalogs by training a model that can analyze images and verify that there is a correspondence with the text that describes each product. This is what we are doing using pre-trained CLIP models.Generating Product ImagesInvesting on image quality for retail stores is usually an easy win for SEOs. The technology is not yet there but there are some interesting startups like vue.ai focusing on this use case and I expect we will have something ready for our clients within a few months. Typically you will focus on:Generating images in different context (changing the background, changing the style)Generating on-model product imageryCreating images from different anglesVideo ModelsProgress made on the text-to-image generation field paved the way to text-to-video generation. There are models already in this field by Microsoft, Meta and recently also Google. Make-a-video by Meta AI is an interesting experiment that present the state of the art in this sector.&nbsp;Speech ModelsAs CLIP has been revolutionary for images, Whisper, a general-purpose speech recognition model by Open AI, is impactful for audio and audio video. Whisper has been trained on 680,000 hours of multilingual and multitask supervised data, bringing automatic speech recognition (ASR) to a new level. You can, as in the example below, automatically add subtitles in English to a video in German or summarize it in a few sentences.Here is the code to get you started with Whisper and YouTube optimization:[Colab] - Code to transcribe a YouTube video, produce subtitles, generate a summary and extract questions and answers.&nbsp;3D ModelsGoogle and NVIDIA have introduced foundational models to populate virtual worlds and enrich AR/VR experiences. A notable example is GET3D which can generate diverse shapes with arbitrary topology, high-quality geometry, and texture. This area will expand as 3D results on Google will increase. Just recently, Google introduced support for 3D shows models. Google\u2019s senior director of product, shopping Lilian Rincon, has also confirmed that Google is actively working on a technology to facilitate the creation of 3D models more straightforwardly.Is it already time to talk about Metaverse SEO? For sure AR/VR is becoming an important acquisition channel. &nbsp;Generative AI StrategyThe flywheel of SEO successGenerative AI is still in its early stages. The model layer is becoming effective thanks to open-source (think of the impact of Stable Diffusion, CLIP, Whisper, and many other freely available models) and well-invested startups like OpenAI, Jina AI, and Hugging Face. However, even when we look at the SEO industry, the application space has barely scratched the surface of what is possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of the applications that we are building look like the first mobile applications for the iPhone or how websites looked in the nineties. It\u2019s a pioneering phase and an exciting time to live.To create a sustainable competitive advantage, we are focusing on our niche: AI-native workflows for SEO. As much as the potentials are broad, we don\u2019t see value in doing everything for everyone. We must focus on marketers, content editors, and SEOs to make a real impact. To win, based on the experience we did so far, organizations shall focus on the following:&nbsp;An exceptional data fabric. Value is extracted when we can fine-tune models and iterate at the speed of light. If we have a knowledge graph, we have a starting point. The chatbot on our website is trained in minutes, with data ingested using a simple query that gets all FAQ content from our blog and all pages inside Read the Docs. When working on an eCommerce website, to validate AI-generated product descriptions, you need a data repository to verify the information quickly. If your data is still in silos, build a data layer first. Integrate this data in an enterprise knowledge graph. Prompting without semantically curated data does not scale. &nbsp;Continuous prompt improvements and user engagement. You need a magic loop to unleash human creativity and blend it with Generative AI. When people talk to me about AI today, I am primarily interested in two aspects:What is their interaction paradigm (how humans are involved in the process), and&nbsp;How is content evaluated? What does the validation pipeline look like?&nbsp;Ethical values. Potentials are impressive and so are the threats behind these large language models. We need to take great care in planning how to use generative AI. We need to be strong. There are many uncertainties on copyright issues, toxicity, cultural biases and more. We have to be conscious and make sure that users are informed when they read or interact with synthetic content (watermarks for images are a good practice that could be introduced, we might also need to add something specific in schema markup etc.).Anatomy Of The Perfect PromptEvery model is a snapshot of the Web (or the chunk of the Web used for its training). Prompting (or prompt engineering), in its very essence, is a reverse-engineered version of the Internet. In a way it reminds us of search engines in the early 2000 where only with the right keyword you could get to the desired results. In prompting,&nbsp; we need to understand what keywords characterize a given expression or an artistic style that we want to reproduce.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an early preview elaborated by David McClure of the corpus of data used for the training of BLOOM - an open source LLM created with the help of EU fundings and HuggingFace. This is a sample of 10 million chunks from the English-language corpus that represent only 1.25% of the information behind BLOOM!As models become larger their ability to provide accurate answers with simple prompts increases.GPT-3 has revolutionized NLP by introducing the concept of few-shot settings. From the original paper by OpenAI we read:&nbsp;\u201cWe train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting.\u201dSince then a lot has changed but few principles remain valid across the different models. These principles are applicable for the generation of text as well as images. Let\u2019s review them:&nbsp;Meta instructions: these are particularly important when using text-to-text models. Things like \u201cSummarize this for a second-grade student\u201d or \u201cwrite the following text as if you were an expert SEO\u201d. By doing this we can help the model understand the expected output. These initial instructions are becoming more relevant as models evolve. We now have models like FLAN-T5 by Google that are solely trained on instructions and the performances are impressive. Research done on LLM has also exposed the emergent features of these models that can be best expressed by using expressions like \u201cA step by step recipe to make bolognese pasta\u201d or sentences like \u201cLet\u2019s think step by step, what is the meaning of life\u201d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;https://twitter.com/arankomatsuzaki/status/1529278580189908993?s=20&amp;t=hH_9R1OH8OSsRDEBIlODhQContent type: these modifiers are very helpful when dealing with CLIP or other models trained with both images and text. For example if I want CLIP to extract features from the image of a product, I will start with \u201ca photograph of\u201d. This will help CLIP understand the type of content I am expecting to analyze or to generate. &nbsp;Description of the subject: here we want to be as descriptive as possible. This is where we need the Knowledge Graph the most. I need a robust taxonomy with all of its attributes to create a solid description of let\u2019s say a product.&nbsp;Style: when writing text the style of the writing will be part of the meta instructions. \u201cI want to write [a,b,c] with the style of Allen Ginsberg\u201d would be a good example. When generating images we can refer to the style of a famous painter or a photographer.When dealing with the generation of images it is also a good practice to&nbsp; injecting materials and techniques using the same language used on well known imagery websites:&nbsp; Digital art, digital painting, color page, featured on pixiv, trending on deviantart, line-art, tarot card, character design, concept art, symmetry, golden ratio, evocative, award winning, shiny, smooth, surreal, divine, celestial, elegant, oil painting, soft, fascinating, fine art.Format: are we composing poetry or are we generating the cover of a magazine like the digital artist Karen X. Cheng did for the Cosmopolitan? What is the expected format for the generated content? One important part of the prompt would do just that. Helping us define the composition. If we deal with an image this will include aspects like image ratio, camera angle, resolution and even type of lenses or rendering details: ultra wide-angle, wide-angle, aerial view, high-res, depth of field, massive scale, panoramic, fisheye, low angle, extreme close-up, tilt and shift, 4k, 8k, octane rendering. Here is an example of format when dealing with poetry. I just made it up but if you need a rabbit hole, dive into AI poetry generation by the brilliant Gwern.&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional parameters and weights: every system has its own set of arguments that can be attached at the end of the prompt. To give you a simple example when using Midjourney we can specify the version of it by adding \u2014v 4 or we can typically change the starting point by applying --seed. Also we can define weights for each word inside our prompt. In Stable Diffusion for example anything after ### will be interpreted as a negative prompt (something that we don\u2019t want to see). In GPT-3 we can use a function called logit biases to prevent or to incentivize the use of a set of tokens. As models evolve it is interesting to exploit these new areas of opportunity. With the latest version of Midjourney or DALL\u00b7E 2 for example we have now the support for image prompts or even multiple prompts at the same time.&nbsp;Images or other files: we can also add in the prompt a set of images and blend images with text. The model will bring embeddings from both images and text within the same vector space. This opens tremendous opportunities as we can work with multiple modalities. As long as we can compute the embeddings of a file we can use it in a prompt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting Started With Prompt EngineeringCrafting the perfect prompt is becoming an art form and a meaningful way to boost productivity across many fields, from programming to SEO, from content writing to digital art. In the last two years, I have been doing all I could to learn and share the craftsmanship of using prompting. It is a skill for literally anyone. These days, things are evolving fast, and there are new and emerging capabilities in these models that are yet to be discovered, but we also have better tooling to get us started. Here is my list:Here is an amazing 82-pages long free eBook on prompt for DALL\u00b7EBuilders to help you with modifiers and parameters like https://promptomania.com/ or https://promptdeck.io/Apps like the CLIP Interrogator that helps you extract (using CLIP by OpenAI) the description of an image (and unveil how contrastive models work)Directory of AI generated images and their prompts like https://prompthero.com/, https://lexica.art/, https://promptsea.io/ and even marketplaces for selling and buying prompts like https://promptbase.com/&nbsp;And models that helps us with the creation of the prompt like https://huggingface.co/spaces/doevent/prompt-generatorFine-Tuning The Models - The Cover ExperimentGenerating featured images for editorial content such as blog posts and news articles is an important part of SEO. Working professionally with foundational models means creating high-quality training datasets. These can be done, only initially manually and eventually needs to scale using semi-automatic workflows.&nbsp;Results from research by Gao et al., 2022 on the improvement of fine-tuning for increasing accuracy of the model.Now, suppose you have a particular type of image that you would like to generate. The best option is to fine-tune an image generation model like Stabe Diffusion to generate these types of images. Here below you can see a few examples of the work I am doing with Seppe Van den Berghe, the fantastic illustrator behind our blog covers.&nbsp;The model creates something similar but it is still far from being as good as Seppe. It lacks semantic compositionality in most cases.You can replicate the same workflow using the code kindly provided as open source by TheLastBen here.The exciting result so far is that Seppe realizes the possibility of these models and how his creative workflow can change. As usual, while working with generative AI, the journey is more important than the destination. AI-powered art won\u2019t replace illustrators anytime soon. However, illustrators like Seppe realize that technology is close enough that they can adopt some form of AI-assisted tool to innovate their craft.The Feedback-Loop Is King (Or Queen Or Both)When working with Generative AI, we create things and make the work of humans more impactful. Rarely in the last months have we started a project where creators (content editors and SEOs) didn\u2019t change their objectives during the project. We typically begin by replicating their best practices and things they learned from past experiences, and we create something entirely new.The core of our work is not to replace humans but to expand their capabilities with the help of AI.&nbsp;How Can We Help Creators Interacting With An AI Model?Sometimes it is as simple as summarizing search results for a query with the right tone of voice and re-training the model using the provided feedback (i.e., \u201cthis is good,\u201d \u201cmhmm, this is not so good,\u201d \u201cThis is okayish but not ready for prime time\u201d).Sometimes it is about turning data into text and encoding existing editorial rules into validation workflows (i.e., \u201cit is ok to use this expression, but we rarely use it,\u201d \u201cdon\u2019t mention this when you mentioned that,\u201d etc.). As users interact with your AI model to flag inaccuracies or to check on the quality of the output, your training data becomes more robust, and the quality increases.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the positive side, LLMs improve significantly as the quality of the training data increases. With a robust model, you can use a limited number of samples (200-400 items can be enough); as the editors provide more input, your training data grows (to thousands of examples), and smaller models can be used. As new models are trained, the validation automatically improves its ability to flag inaccuracy, and more synthetic data can be added to the training. &nbsp;Future WorkGenerative AI in SEO is a strategic asset for online growth. Having a Generative AI strategy in place means focusing on your data fabric and the interaction patterns that help you train small and highly specialized models. Bridging the gaps between LLMs and enterprise business problems is an SEO task.&nbsp;In its inner nature, SEO is about extensive metadata curation (from nurturing knowledge graphs to publishing structured data) and content optimization. Both skills are in high demand to unlock a wide range of complex enterprise use cases.&nbsp;We see LLMs evolving into agents and being able to interact with external cognitive assets such as knowledge graphs. Multi-prompt is clearing, opening a new wave of usage patterns for AI models.&nbsp;&nbsp;What Is A Data Fabric?A data fabric is a modern data management architecture that allows organizations to quickly use more of their data more often to fuel generative AI, digital transformation, and, last but not least, SEO. Data fabrics are a newer idea, first formally defined in 2016 by Forrester Analyst Noel Yuhanna in his report \u201cBig Data Fabric Drives Innovation and Growth.\u201dHow Can I Make My AI-Generated Images?For anyone willing to test text-to-image generation or even image-to-image generation here is a list of tools that you can use:Dream Studio by the same team that released Stable Diffusion;Diffusion Bee (Mac only) brings you Stable Diffusion on your local computer, this can be helpful when dealing with private images;&nbsp;DALL\u00b7E 2 by Open AI, the AI system to create realistic images;Midjourney my favorite pick for AI art generation;&nbsp;Replicate a startup simplifying the access to AI models by providing an API.How Can I Optimize My Prompt?Prompt engineering is a unique interface to foundational models. I don\u2019t expect to see creators disappear, but I hope to see creators at the top of their games becoming very familiar with AI tools and the intricacies of prompt engineering.

        "text": "Rich Snippet What is a Rich Snippet?\rA rich snippet is a specialized form of snippet result that seeks to provide information and deliver answers to inquiries directly in the SERP. Rich snippets are generally considered more reliable and engaging compared to regular blue links. These snippets can be interacted with and provide a variety of differing functions. While these snippets are more convenient and useful, they can also be more complicated and require some work to implement them. Often times, they may require structured data markup in order for a website\u2019s content to appear in a featured snippet.\rHow a Rich Snippet differs from a Regular Blue Link\rWhile the standard blue links can be found all over the SERP and contain little more than a title, URL and meta-description, a rich snippet provides much more specialized results. They can feature more information, a longer description, pictures, ratings, sitelinks and more. Rich snippets almost always appear at the very top of the SERP, even above the first blue links results. Rich snippets are more engaging and appealing to users as they both deliver queries directly and are more trusted by Google compared to standard blue links.\rTypes of Rich Snippets\rThere are a wide variety of rich snippet types and even more variations of these types to perform different functions. There are a few primary ones that carry over into many subcategories and varying types. Among these include:\r\r \tPeople Also Ask - A Question and Answer type that asks commonly inquired questions from other users and answers using information from third-party websites.\r \tFAQ - A Question and Answer type that provides questions and direct answers from a specific website.\r \tHowTo - A box providing a step-by-step instructions to a problem, commonly provides technical answers and advice.\r \tKnowledge Card - A card displaying the entity of a search query from the Google Knowledge Graph. Applies to people, brands, companies, organizations, sports teams, events and media properties.\r \tCarousel - A selection of scrollable cards displaying entities of people, locations, dishes, or other objects tied together by a shared entity or piece of information.\r \tSiteLinks - Links to different sections on a single website.\r\rA SERP featuring many different types of rich snippets, like a knowledge card, video carousel, image carousel, and people also ask.\r\rThere are also many, many more types of featured snippets for more specialized functions. Examples can include: Movie Carousels for movies of a specific genre or feature the same actress, Recipes to display different online recipes for a specific dish, or Flights which display a series of flights to a specific destination or similar destinations. Each have their own use and their own requirements for your content to be featured on the SERP.\rThe Relationship between Rich Snippets and Structured Data\rWhile some content can be featured on it\u2019s own or through information from existing entities, others require structured data in order to be utilized. In the latter case, a specific type of structured data must be added using the required markup from schema.org. You can do this with WordLift, which makes things far easier than having to code everything yourself.\r\rDifferent types of rich snippets may require different markup for structured data. Some types may match the name of the rich snippet, like the HowTo snippet uses HowTo markup. However, others may use less obvious types or multiple markup types at once. What you need depends on the kind of content you want to provide and what rich snippet you want to feature. You can search for different vocabulary types on the Schema glossary.\r\rIf you would like to learn more about rich snippets and how to implement them using the schema markup on your website using WordLift, check out our spectacular guide here on the WordLift blog.",

        "text": "Google Voice Search What is Google Voice Search?&nbsp;Google Voice Search (also known as Search by Voice) is a Google technology that allows you to use Google Search by speaking with a mobile phone or with a computer. This technology is available anywhere: you have to click or tap on the microphone icon in the Google bar and speak out loud about your query.This technology has many upsides. Its main advantage is that you can search hands-free, which means you can be multitasking and do whatever you want while Google replies to your questions.Also, voice search appears to be faster because most people speak faster than they type. No more typing, hands-free, direct answers: voice search is user-friendly because it resembles a natural conversation.When a search is not enough to give you the correct answer straight away, Google Actions come in handy.What are Google Actions?Google Actions are apps that extend the native voice search results on the Google Assistant to help users get things done using their voice. Rather than tapping on your phone as we usually do with Apps, an action lets us accomplish tasks mainly using our voice through a natural-sounding conversation.For example, you can ask Google to turn on the light or play a song, a podcast or a radio channel.How many languages does Google Voice Search speak?Once only available for American English, commands are now&nbsp;processed in 60 different languages, plus their local varieties.Since August 2014, Google app users can choose up to five languages and the app will automatically recognize the spoken language. This feature is perfect for polyglots who speak more than a language fluently and need to find localized content.How can you select multiple languages on your Google Voice Search?To select multiple languages, open the main Google app settings and open the Voice section. The menu item you\u2019re looking for is called&nbsp;Languages. This will open up a new selection menu containing all the languages supported, each with a checkbox. You can select up to five of them for your phone to recognize on the fly, but make sure you long-press to pick a default language as well.How do you use Google Voice Search?Android Devices: Android users can turn on Google Voice Search anytime saying \"OK Google\". You can use it to give voice commands to the device, find any information, and get directions.iOS Devices: iPhone and iPad users can activate voice search on Google App saying \"OK Google\".Chrome: desktop users can activate Google Voice Search on their computers on Chrome browsers.Google Maps: mobile users can use voice commands to get directions and other information from Maps.YouTube: English-speaking users can use a derivation of Google Voice Search to add text captions on videos.Google Home: the newborn home assistant by Google is powered by the same technology.How can you optimize your content for Google Voice Search?If you are a content marketer or a journalist, you may find&nbsp;this handy checklist helpful to&nbsp;optimize your content for voice search. Start with our 5 steps checklist.1. Answer questions (and do it accurately)Many voice searches are questions that start with&nbsp;the&nbsp;5W + H&nbsp;(if you don\u2019t remember from your school days, they are&nbsp;Who,&nbsp;What,&nbsp;When,&nbsp;Where,&nbsp;Why&nbsp;and&nbsp;How). Usually, the answers to questions that start with Who, What, When and Where are a single piece of information that can be isolated: that is why&nbsp;Google&nbsp;and Intelligent Agents tend to answer this kind of questions with instant answers. Owning or being the result picked as an instant answer is a strategic asset (the so-called Rank Zero&nbsp;case).WordLift offers you the chance to structure your content assigning a role to each piece of information using&nbsp;the&nbsp;Who,&nbsp;What,&nbsp;When&nbsp;and&nbsp;Where&nbsp;categories.2. Make your content easy to readOrganize the content of your page with&nbsp;subtitles,&nbsp;bullet points,&nbsp;tables, and some&nbsp;highlights: it will help machines understand the content on your page. Also, remember that many people tend to quickly scan a page before actually reading it: a neat content organization of your page will help your hasty readers and give them a reason to read your article thoroughly.3. Optimize for mobile and local&nbsp;searchMost times, voice search comes from mobile devices. Keep it in mind and consider that a mobile-friendly website is crucial for your&nbsp;SEO. Let\u2019s take a step forward and think about how proximity could eventually change the relevance of your content. If you own a local activity, it probably does:&nbsp;think about how your products or services may help people around you and structure your content accordingly.Think about the needs of people walking near your office and feed them with helpful information about your business.4. Add schema.org markupSchema.org&nbsp;markup helps you add a context to your content: you can use it to explicit the relations between information in your content, disambiguate the words you are using, and give structure to your pages. When using schema.org markup, you are communicating with machines through semantics instead of keywords: you are helping machines define the context around information to turn into valuable results for humans.WordLift&nbsp;creates a knowledge graph and adds Schema.org markup to your content: this is one of the main strength points of our&nbsp;plugin;&nbsp;learn more in this article.5. Embrace everyday languageDo you think that average users talk to their virtual assistants with complicated, hyper-specialized words? Wrong! They will most likely use everyday language or even slang to ask questions. So, more than ever, remember the KISS principle: \u201ckeep it simple, stupid!\u201c.&nbsp;Ask yourself what users who know&nbsp;nothing or nearly nothing about the topic you are writing about would search, and then write for them.Einstein used to say: \u201cIf you can\u2019t explain it simply you don\u2019t understand it well enough\u201c.How are people using Google Voice Search?In this infographic, you can find several data about how people use voice assistants. At a glance, you will see which commands are the most used, how different generations are performing different tasks through these technologies, how to use virtual assistants to be more productive, and which are the strengths, weaknesses, and differences between the most widespread solutions.In addition, in this article, based on Google\u2018s data, you can find out how people are using smart speakers, how this technology affects online shopping and consumption, and what kind of relation users have with this technology.10 actionable tips on how to optimize your content for Google Voice SearchStarting from what voice search is and why it is so crucial for your online business, in this Voice Search Guide, we will share 10&nbsp;actionable tips&nbsp;on optimising your content for voice search and different SEO techniques that can help you with this. You will also discover how to create&nbsp;content-based Google Actions&nbsp;starting with your news, podcasts, and recipes in order to open new access points to your content from the Google Assistant.Do you want to learn more about Google Voice Search?

        "text": "How To Increase Sales With Google Smart Shopping What is Google Smart Shopping?Google Smart Shopping is a new campaign on Google ADS that makes it easier to advertise products through artificial intelligence and automation. A Smart Shopping campaign creates ads in both Shopping and Display formats, which will be automatically distributed across the Search Network, Display Network, YouTube and Gmail.Google Smart Shopping ads are straightforward to set up, making them perfect for all those who don't have enough time, budget or skills to create more advanced ads. It will be Google itself that will test different combinations of text and images for your ad and then automatically show the best performing results. Another advantage of Smart Shopping campaigns is that Google manages the ad placements and bidding for each ad in complete autonomy, helping you optimize your budget and conversions.Google Smart Shopping campaigns can be activated by anyone with a Merchant Center Feed, limiting 100 campaigns per Google Ads account. They can also be easily integrated into third-party apps (such as the Shopify platform) to make ad creation and results tracking even more accessible.How does Google Smart Shopping work?By combining your product feed with Google's machine learning capabilities, Google Smart Shopping campaigns can create and display multiple ads across the search engine's many networks. Basically, the system extracts information from your product feed, generates different combinations with the text and images you provide, and then shows the most relevant ads on the various networks.For geo-localized campaigns in Europe, you can also have the ads appear on any Comparative Shopping Service (SSC). In this case, your ads will be displayed in Google networks and the results pages and specific placements made available by these services.Finally, as we've already mentioned, Google Smart Shopping automates the distribution of placements and manages your budget so that you get maximum conversion value.One last tip. Although each Google Ads account can trigger up to 100 such campaigns, Google suggests (where possible) that you merge them into a single campaign - this is because, quite simply, machine learning works best when it can tap into an extensive database.Of course, it's also true that profit margins can be very different when we're talking about different product categories. Instead, it will be appropriate to opt for several campaigns in cases like this, each with a bidding strategy linked to a different target ROAS (Return on Advertising Investment).The advantages of Google Smart Shopping campaignsThe most significant advantage of Google Smart Shopping campaigns can count on the power of Google's machine learning.Activate a campaign of this type. The platform will create the ads based on your product feed, show them in various formats across different networks, test the most performing combinations and calibrate the entire campaign to promote maximum conversion value.In summary, we can define 3 strengths of this new format:1) Effortless optimizationSmart Shopping campaigns create ads from your product feed. Google then uses powerful tools to test the various ads and show the ones that perform best.2) Automatic biddingBidding and ad placements are automated, aiming for maximum conversion value within your defined budget.3) Simple integrationYou can create and manage Smart Shopping campaigns through third-party platforms (e.g. Spotify or Woocommerce) to optimize your marketing and tracking activities.Why should you use Google Smart Shopping?Google Smart Shopping campaigns are the ideal solution if:You want to simplify the management of your ads campaigns. You can create ads quickly, and the ads require minimal management and maintenance.You want to improve the results of your already active Google Shopping campaigns. Machine learning can help you to intercept the right audience and achieve your goals.You have little time or experience in managing Google Shopping campaigns.What are the differences between Google Shopping campaigns and Google Smart Shopping campaigns?With Google Smart Shopping, you can use artificial intelligence to improve your existing Google Shopping campaigns. In the table below, we show you the main differences between a \"classic\" Shopping campaign and a Smart Shopping campaign:Remember, however, that in Google Smart Shopping campaigns, you can use only one landing page for each campaign (while in standard campaigns, you can correlate several landing pages to different ads). You will be forced to select a catalogue page as the landing page.How to set up and optimize a Google Smart Shopping campaignUse remarketing lists in your Google Smart Shopping campaign (and continually add new users to the lists). To ensure the best coverage for your ads, it's essential to have accumulated at least 100 active users in the last 30 days.Set up conversion tracking with specific transaction values and make sure you have at least 20 transactions in the last 45 days.Add a global site tag to your website to build your remarketing list. You can also connect your Google Analytics account and manage the tags directly from there.Want to go step-by-step? Leave your existing campaigns active (Shopping or Display Remarketing type) and try setting up the campaign on a specific product group. After 15 days - the time it takes to maximize conversions - compare the results of the different campaigns.Consider using bidding based on target ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) to reach your minimum daily goals.If you want to increase the volume of conversions, try lowering the conversion value you set as the target ROAS-based offer.Optimize your feed's titles, descriptions, and images based on relevance and work by the requirements and specifications provided by Google.How WordLift can improve your Google Smart Shopping campaignsWhen you set up a Smart Shopping campaign, the product feed is central. And that's why structured data becomes essential: the accuracy of the markup determines how your products will appear.Without structured data, the appearance of your products in ads will be decidedly poor. Conversely, adding structured data will allow you to communicate information such as product features, the category it belongs to, reviews, and availability.In this way, you will create a rich snippet with which your product will be more visible (and attractive) on the crowded Google Shopping page, making it even more suitable for your campaign!WordLift inserts structured data and extended product markup that allow your products to gain more visibility in the Google retailer directory.In addition to all this, E-Commerce SEO by WordLift (our plugin dedicated to online shops) allows you to access Google Shopping even without having created a custom product feed: the structured data of your product pages and category pages will allow you to appear in Google's product listings \u263aTo discover the other advantages of structured data for your e-commerce SEO, read this article.[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "JSON-LD What is JSON-LD?JSON-LD is a&nbsp;lightweight&nbsp;Linked Data format&nbsp;to easily&nbsp;read and write structured data on the web using open vocabularies&nbsp;like schema.org. Recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium, JSON-LD is the heir of the JSON format and allows linked&nbsp;data to operate in a Web-scale environment. The idea behind this notation is to provide search engines&nbsp;with&nbsp;contextual information&nbsp;about a web page using semantic web technologies. This helps to improve the match between the intent of the searcher and the content being published.How can I use JSON-LD on my website?JSON has been traditionally used by UX designers to feed widgets with data. With the advent of JSON-LD, developers can&nbsp;reuse this&nbsp;same data structures to create new front-end&nbsp;UI widgets as well as&nbsp;feeding&nbsp;search engine crawlers with the metadata that describe the&nbsp;exact meaning of page\u2019s content.JSON-LD uses the vocabulary of&nbsp;Schema.org&nbsp;to&nbsp;describe what a web page is about. A presentation layer can be added with&nbsp;custom UI elements developed in either&nbsp;Polymer&nbsp;or&nbsp;React components.&nbsp;How can I add JSON-LD to my WordPress website?There are various plugin to&nbsp;include&nbsp;Schema.org&nbsp;JSON-LD syntax markup to&nbsp;your WordPress website. WordLift is one of these&nbsp;options that above all has the advantage of adding this tags automatically based on the analysis of the content being written. WordLift uses Natural Language Processing to extract named entities that are proposed to the editor&nbsp;to tag his/her content.&nbsp;These entities have unique IDs (unique resource identifier) in the web of data, with this IDs WordLift extracts the information and automatically injects it in the web pages using JSON-LD.&nbsp;What if - instead - you'd like to give your readers the opportunity to go deeper into some entity, but don't want them to leave your article? Well, we are also thinking about that...How to reuse the metadata about an entity in the front-end of your websiteSee the Pen Parsing JSON-LD by nicola bertelloni (@wanbinkimoon) on CodePen.Why is JSON-LD the best format for structured data? The advantages of using JSON-LD to write structured data compared to other formats like microdata&nbsp;are the following: \tIt does not affect the performance of the page because it can be loaded asynchronously  \tIt is injected in the page without impacting on the existing HTML structure and tags  \tIt is easy to be reused by web developers as it follows the JSON syntax  \tIt leverages on linked dataThat is also why Google incentives websites owners to use structured data on a web page in the form of JSON-LD. This format allows entities, therefore concepts to become linked. ",

        "text": "What is a Knowledge Graph? A comprehensive Guide What is the technical definition of knowledge graph?A knowledge graph acquires and integrates information into an ontology and applies a reasoner to derive new knowledge.(Lisa Ehrlinger and Wolfram W\u00f6\u00df - University of Linz in Austria)Useful concepts, places, people, organizations, etc. are organized into entities that can be brought up to display important information about the entity from a wide database. These entities connect through each other through various relationships. It utilizes machine learning technology to develop applications to collect and display custom search engine results programmatically. Some knowledge graphs utilize special programming such as Google, which uses JSON API and schema.org markup to create schematic data that enables website content to be embedded in the SERP.The term knowledge graph has been frequently used in research and business, in close association with Semantic Web technologies, linked data, web-scale data analytics, and cloud computing. At SEMANTiCS, a&nbsp;few years ago, a research paper titled \"Towards a Definition of Knowledge Graphs\u201d by&nbsp;the&nbsp;Institute for Application Oriented Knowledge Processing&nbsp;of the University of Linz was presented to propose a definition of the knowledge graph that focuses on data modelling and reasoning.The popularity of the term is strictly connected with the launch of the&nbsp;Google&nbsp;Knowledge Graph in 2012 and by the introduction of other large databases by&nbsp;major tech companies, such as Yahoo, Microsoft, AirBnB and Facebook, that have created their own \u201cknowledge graphs\u201d to power semantic searches and enable smarter processing of data.In the context of the Semantic Web, a knowledge graph is a way of representing knowledge. In short, you start from a few triples and those triples are put in a relationship to build a graph. For instance, let's have a closer look - using Semantic Web&nbsp;technologies - at the Apology of Socrates entity on this blog:Source: LodLiveAs you can see we have a set of triples that tell us a story: The Apology of Socrates, also known as Apology of Socrates is about Socrates, has been written by Plato and mentions the concepts of Daemon and Socratic Dialogue.&nbsp;A knowledge graph doesn't speak any particular language. Language is human; a knowledge graph gets expressed in open linked data, which is the language of machines.Imagine your entire website built upon a large knowledge graph made of all the metadata that describes the thing that you write about. That knowledge graph becomes part of a larger graph that comprises the new web. That is the power of the Semantic Web.Is A Knowledge Graph A Graph?Knowledge Graphs are a way to store both information and its meaning. Imagine an Excel table, but with every line written according to a specific shared convention. More than this: imagine each line of this Excel table to be connected with many other lines.&nbsp;For now, I've asked you to imagine it as a table (an Excel table). Still, a good way of visualizing the relationships between information inside a knowledge graph is by laying out the information in a graph.&nbsp;What kind of graph? Imagine a family ancestry tree or even an organizational structure where each department head is linked to the CEO. These are simple graph representations that you can also use to display information in a knowledge graph.&nbsp;How Does A Knowledge Graph Work?&nbsp;A knowledge graph works by showing the relationships between each statement in it. We call the statements (or the lines in the Excel table) \"entities.\" And that's where a knowledge graph reveals its smarts. Once I put entities in a relationship with one another, I can feed this information to all sorts of machines that will instantly make meaning.If I write that Andrea is the CEO of WordLift, all of you human readers (and a part of the computers) will understand this statement. But suppose I use the \"Organization\" schema to store the same information in a knowledge graph. In that case, I will be 100% sure that all machines will comprehend this.&nbsp;How Do You Draw A Knowledge Graph?Computers are great at drawing knowledge graphs. They can trace the relationships between each entity as lines and each entity in the graph as a node. See the example below.&nbsp;How Are Knowledge Graphs Used In Machine Learning?Knowledge Graphs are some of the best training data you can feed to machine learning algorithms. The strong ties between entities help computers extract the meaning behind the data. Knowledge Graphs are a great way to train a model because of their semantic nature.&nbsp;What Is The Difference Between An Ontology And A Knowledge Graph?A knowledge graph is data organized following ontologies. The most widespread ontology is schema.org, adapted most importantly by Google for their Google Knowledge Graph.&nbsp;What Is Not A Knowledge Graph?Not every dataset is a Knowledge Graph. To be qualified as a knowledge graph, information needs to be both organized and connected. A knowledge graph's goal is always to make sense and meaning of its data and not just represent information.&nbsp;What Is The Google Knowledge Graph?In 2012 Google revolutionized its search engine by launching its knowledge graph. Their focus started a change from search terms to topics (or entities). We devote a whole article to describing Google's Knowledge Graph and its far-reaching consequences.&nbsp;Why Should I Pay Attention To Knowledge Graphs?The main reason all businesses should pay close attention to knowledge graphs is their role in SEO. Adding structured data to your web pages is a sure way of increasing your rankings and getting more organic traffic. E-commerce websites can especially benefit from Product Knowledge Graphs.That said, the advantages of a knowledge graph are far more significant: more and more companies are building their business around more innovative data stores. A knowledge graph allows them to find more customers and serve them better. Some companies even move their whole company database to the graph, making connections and meaning throughout their business. What Are Some Popular Knowledge GraphsThere are many different types of knowledge graphs developed by different companies that are used for different purposes. While many companies use an internal or smaller knowledge graph for online functions, some of the biggest ones are being used by many people all over the world. Below lists a selection of some of the largest knowledge graphs to date from Microsoft, Google, Facebook, IBM and eBay.DeveloperPurpose &amp; FunctionStage of DevelopmentMicrosoftUses knowledge graph for the Bing search engine, LinkedIn data &amp; Academics.Actively used in productsGoogleKnowledge graph is used as a massive categorization function across Google\u2019s devices and directly embedded in the&nbsp;search engine.Actively used in productsFacebookDevelops connections between people, events and ideas, mainly focusing on news, people and events related to the social network.Actively used in productsIBMProvides a framework for other companies and/or industries to develop internal knowledge graphs.Actively used by clientseBayCurrently developing a knowledge graph that functions to provide connections between users and products provided on the website.Early Stage of DevelopmentMost people conducting SEO will tend to focus on the Google Knowledge Graph as it\u2019s the most frequently used and relevant knowledge graph for SEO. As Google, being the most popular search engine and the driver behind a lot of search engine innovation, it\u2019s important to focus on developing entities and embedding them into the knowledge graph. Microsoft\u2019s knowledge graph is still something to pay close attention to, as while not as many people use Bing, plenty of people do use Microsoft\u2019s services, including LinkedIn. So while Google may be the primary focus of SEO and entity development, it\u2019s important not to forget about Microsoft. Thankfully, they both use schema markup, so developing entries for both of them shouldn\u2019t be too difficult.Other knowledge graphs may be useful in SEO in certain circumstances. For example, Facebook\u2019s knowledge graph might be useful for branding, local businesses, and people hosting events for embedding in their social network. IBM\u2019s knowledge graph might be useful in working within the internal knowledge graphs of other companies but may still hold value for SEO. The same goes for eBay\u2019s knowledge graph, though it is more uncertain as their knowledge graph is still in the early stages of implementation and development. There are also many more knowledge graphs not listed above that are used by many publishers and developers across many different platforms.What Is The History of Knowledge Graphs?Believe it or not, but the history of knowledge graphs and their use predates both search engines and the internet as a whole. Many of you may remember the graphs used in Geometry, Algebra and Calculus classes in high school or college. Knowledge graphs function in a similar manner, only instead of lines and shapes being used to connect points on a graph, entities are connected to other entities through lines of structured data and schema markup.In 1735, famous mathematician Leonhard Euler was presented with a problem in the city of K\u00f6nigsberg, Prussia in what is now Kaliningrad in modern-day Russia. There were 7 bridges in the city that connect through a central island and run across the Pregel River, and the challenge was whether or not it was possible to form a straight path where every bridge is crossed only once. Rather than making every possible walk throughout the city to figure this out, he chose to create the first chart and plot out the city and the endpoints of every bridge. While his ultimate conclusion was that this was not possible, he ended up inventing graph theory in the process.While Graph theory continued to develop throughout the centuries, the first major breakthrough in developing the basis of knowledge graphs came in 1966 with Joseph Weizenbaum\u2019s development of the ELIZA computer program. The program would use a system of code known as DOCTOR to conduct machine learning in a manner that would allow the program to communicate with humans as though it were an empathetic therapist. This enabled the software to conduct a primitive version of queries and delivering results. Although Weizenbaum began to question the nature of his program and the role of artificial intelligence, ELIZA laid the important foundations of knowledge graphs to come.Taking both graph theory and machine learning technology provided by ELIZA, the development of the enterprise graph was the next major step in the development of knowledge graphs. Enterprise graphs were developed to organize and identify all available information on a specific topic, field, person, product, etc. within an organization. Think of it as an internal knowledge graph or database utilized within a specific company, organization or industry. It\u2019s not known when exactly the first enterprise graph was developed, though the development of knowledge graphs by Google and Facebook in organizing their content and entities. While it took a while before knowledge graphs could properly get off the ground, they\u2019re certainly starting to shine today.What Is The Future of Knowledge Graphs?The first knowledge graph was launched by Google on May 12th, 2012 as a means of enhancing the value of the knowledge provided by the search engine. By using structured data through schema markup, a user could provide information in HTML code that could then be picked up and used in knowledge cards and the newly developing featured snippets. What this meant is that websites could gain traction by providing answers to queries directly on the SERP.Other search engines and companies began to also develop knowledge graphs. Some, like Microsoft, developed them for a similar purpose to Google; while others, like Facebook, have been developing them for different reasons, namely people and events as opposed to general knowledge about the world. When it comes to SEO, schema markup has expanded to be compatible with Yahoo and Microsoft Bing in addition to Google, making it easy to provide markup for the top search engines.Today, knowledge graphs are being utilized in many companies and provide a knowledge network for a variety of different functions. As knowledge graph technology continues to develop and evolve, it faces many new challenges. Issues like changing knowledge, potential consequences of machine learning, managing identities, as well as concerns regarding security and privacy are all ongoing issues facing many knowledge graph developers. These issues will continue to be a challenge for some time to come and perhaps more so in the future.[wl_chord]",

        "text": "Google Knowledge Panel Would you like to use the Google Knowledge Panel to your advantage?Well, you've come to the right place. In this article we will discuss all the most relevant aspects of the Knowledge Panel, we will explain how to get it and increase the visibility of your business or your brand.Let's get started!What is the Google Knowledge Panel?The Knowledge Panel is the information box on the right-hand side of some Google results pages (SERPs). A \"rich result\" summarizes the most relevant information related to a particular entity or topic.[Not sure what an entity is? Read our article on the Google Knowledge Graph]The content reported by the Knowledge Panel can come from various sources: structured data markup on web pages, data provided directly by websites using markup languages such as JSON-LD, or from other Google services.What are the different types of Google Knowledge Panels?There are two primary varieties of Knowledge Panels: the brand type and the local type.Brand panels include general information about the entity in question, such as links to social profiles, product descriptions, and the date of birth of the brand (among others). On the other hand, the local panels contain specifications related to the regional dimension, such as locations, addresses, reviews, or links to Yelp pages.But let's see in detail the differences.Local Panel Local Knowledge Panels are displayed when users enter a query with local search intent. Although the content may vary slightly depending on the activity, typically, local boxes contain information such as:opening hourslocationscontact informationreviewsimagesLocal boxes help users gather all the necessary information about a specific company or business before visiting it - and, in many cases, play a significant role in persuading users to see it!In fact, through the local panel, people can read reviews from other customers, ask questions about the business, call, make appointments, get directions, check product availability, order food to go, and more. All great levers to push them to get in touch with a business, don't you think?Are you wondering how to get your business to appear in Google's Local Knowledge Panel?While the exact workings of the Google algorithm remain a secret, we know that factors such as relevance, distance, and business importance impact visibility in organic search results.And before you ask: no, you can't pay to appear within this coveted box!Personal or branded Panel&nbsp;The Google Knowledge Panel can also take a different form and become a space that contains essential facts about an entity (a person, a concept, a brand).And, as you can imagine, appearing in the Google Knowledge Panel is a great opportunity to get visibility - and clicks - in organic results.The box's design can vary a lot depending on the scope and type of brand or entity being addressed. The same goes for the content: from Knowledge Panels that contain very little information to those that offer such a detailed overview that rival a Wikipedia page.TIP: The best performing Google Knowledge Panels are those linked to a Wikipedia page. The presence of a dedicated page on Wikipedia makes it easier to be approved by Google and increases the credibility and authority of the brand.Why is the Google knowledge panel important?By now, you should have understood: appearing in the Knowledge Panel is an opportunity for visibility not to be missed. In this way, in fact, not only does your business gain immediate prominence and relevance in Google SERPs, but it also attracts more clicks than a typical search result.So let's get to the most crucial question of all\u2026How do you get a Google knowledge panel?The Knowledge Panel appears when Google thinks that the box can provide helpful information about the entity (person, place, organization, etc.) that the user is looking for at that moment.In other words, Google Knowledge Panels are automatically generated when a person is searching for information about an entity in the Google Knowledge Graph.Does this mean you have to rely on the benevolence of the search engine? Not really. There are a few actions you can take to encourage Google to make your business or brand appear.Let's see them together.Step 1 - Make a Wikipedia and Wikidata pageWikipedia and Wikidata are the primary sources Google draws on to create its Knowledge Panels, so the first thing to do is build your online presence on both of these platforms.Step 2 - Be Active on Social Media PlatformsAs we have already mentioned, social profiles are linked within the information box. What's more, Google can use social media as a source to find out more about your brand, your services, and how it operates.Step 3: Implement a Schema MarkupImplementing structured data on your site allows Google to understand your web page content and structure effectively. Schema Markup can also improve your organic visibility and the CTR of your search results (to find out more read this article).Beyond structured data, we recommend using meta tags to provide as much data about your website as possible. You can optimize your meta tags by making sure to include your main keyword in the title and meta description. And don't forget to include some author information as well!How do you improve your Google Knowledge panel?Inserting Schema Markup on your site means to be sure that search engines fully understand your content, with stunning effects on visibility.Are you worried about the technical difficulty? Fortunately, WordLift makes it easy!Our suite allows you to add structured data to your site fully automatically. It works like this: artificial intelligence scans your texts and suggests topics relevant to your business. The issues are transformed into entities and form your vocabulary. At that point, WordLift allows you to create your customized Knowledge Graph.If you want to learn more, I suggest you read this article.NEW UPDATE: from the 12th of October 2021, Podcast Knowledge Panels live on Google Search!

This simple example will help you understand how linked data conveys concepts and connections.Let\u2019s say that on Website A we can present the entity Jason and the fact that he knows Marie. On website B we can provide all the information about Marie \u00a0and on the Website C we can find information about Marie\u2019s birthplace.Each page contains the structured data to describe an entity\u00a0(Jason, Marie and Italy) and the link to the entity that could be described\u00a0on a different page or even on a different website.\u00a0Below, you can find a real-life example of the linked open data graph visualization from the website of our client, Salzburgerland Tourism.What is the role of Linked Data?Back in 2006 Tim Berners-Lee described\u00a0linked data as follows:The Semantic Web isn't just about putting data on the web. It is about making links, so that a person or machine can explore the web of data. \u00a0With linked data, when you have some of it, you can find other, related, data.In computing\u00a0linked data describes a method of publishing and linking\u00a0data coming\u00a0from heterogeneous data sources that\u00a0can be interlinked and shared.Linked Data\u00a0builds upon standard Web technologies such as HTTP and URIs, but rather than using them to serve web pages for human readers, it extends them to share information in a way that can be read automatically by computers. This enables data from different sources to be connected and queried.Queries over linked data are made using\u00a0a semantic query language called SPARQL that allows\u00a0to retrieve and manipulate data stored in Resource Description Framework (RDF) format.Learn how we got to the Linked Data in SEO and why you need to build a Knowledge Graph side-by-side with your website to stand out in search results by reading our article.Linked Data ExplainedThis\u00a0great\u00a0introduction video\u00a0on linked data, the Google Knowledge Graph and Facebook Open Graph protocol was\u00a0done by\u00a0@manusporny.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x_xzT5eF5QWhy is it Important to Publish 5-stars Linked Data?Tim Berners-Lee suggested a 5-star deployment scheme for Open Data. Below, you can find examples for each grade in order to understand why publishing 5-stars linked data is so important:\u2605 Make your content available on the web with an open license.\u2605\u2605 Make your content available as machine-readable structured data (e.g., Excel instead of an image scan of a table). If you\u2019re using WordLift, you will also be able to enrich your structured data with more related pieces of information, the so-called properties.\u2605\u2605\u2605 Make your content available in a non-proprietary open format (e.g., CSV instead of Excel).\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Assign a unique and permanent URl to each entity to identify them and to make your content easily findable by people using stable IDs.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Link your data to other data to provide a context: now the web is connected and you\u2019ve reached the 5th star.Linked Data PrinciplesThere are four simple principles to follow when publishing data on the web (and yes, structured data is linked\u00a0open data as it is fully accessible). Use URIs as names for things (this is the unique identifier that we introduced above)Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those names (this means that the ID of every entity shall be accessible via HTTP URI) When someone looks up a URI, provide useful information, using the standards (Behind these URIs we need to publish data using a linked data standard called RDF)Include links to other URIs. so that they can discover more things (and here is where we need to add owl:sameAs property).To put it simply, a 5-stars open dataset is simply a way to publish metadata (using linked data standard) that makes it readable and accessible by machines.That is why by connecting a piece of text, written by a human with an open dataset created by a machine, our content becomes fully accessible and machine-friendly. Some of the primary datasets that implement the 5-stars linked data schema are foundational for the machine learning algorithms behind semantic search engines like Google and Bing as well as digital personal assistants like Alexa, Cortana, and the Google Assistant. These datasets (like DBpedia, Wikidata, Geonames just to name it a few) are all interlinked together to form a Linked Open Data Cloud.When you add structured data to your WordPress website using a plugin like WordLift, that structured data gets published as open linked data. In short, your WordPress website, and the metadata of your own content becomes part of that Linked Open Data Cloud. Thus by adding an additional layer to the Semantic Web your WordPress website also becomes part of it!

        "text": "Machine Learning What is Machine Learning?Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence for the studying of algorithms that computer systems can use to derive knowledge from data.Machine learning algorithms are used to build mathematical models of sample data, known as \"training data\", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.There are three different types of machine learning algorithms:Supervised Learning. The data is labeled with the expected outcome in a \"training dataset\" that will help the system train itself to predict the outcome on new (previously unseen) data samples.Unsupervised Learning. Here the machine has no inputs in terms of expected outcomes and labels but it simply gets the features as numerical attributes and will find the hidden structure of the dataset.Reinforcement Learning. It helps with decision-making tasks. The system gets a reward when it is capable of making measurable progress on a given action without knowing how to get to the end. A typical example is the chess\u00a0game. The system learns by evaluating the results of a single action (i.e. moving of one square the\u00a0horse).Machine learning is a subset of AI, which is an umbrella term for any computer program that does something smart.\u00a0In this blog, we focus on the use of machine learning for search engine optimization,\u00a0natural language processing, knowledge graph\u00a0and structured data.\u00a0Jeff Dean, Senior Fellow, and SVP at Google announced the introduction of Pathways: a new AI architecture multi-tasking, multi-modal, and more efficient.To find out more about Google Pathways, check out our Web Stories here.\u00a0[wl_faceted_search title=\"Read more about Machine Learning\"][et_pb_section global_module=\"10045\"][/et_pb_section]",

        "text": "Natural language processing What is natural language processing?Natural language processing (or NLP) is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics that has to do\u00a0with the interactions between computers and humans using natural languages. As such, NLP is related to the area of human\u2013computer interaction. Many challenges in NLP involve natural language understanding -- that is, enabling computers to derive meaning from human and natural language generation -- the ability to produce textual content.\u00a0How does Google use NLP?Since Google Knowledge Graph and Hummingbird were released, Google\u00a0reads human language, through Natural Language Processing.When I type in Google\u2019s search box \u201cmoon distance,\u201d that is what I get:You may think this is simple keyword matching, but it is not. In fact, if I ask \u201cHow far is the moon?\u201d I get the same answer.Google\u2019s ability to understand language goes further. If I search \u201cmoon distance in meters\u201d that is what I get:In short, Google knows I\u2019m referring to the same thing and gives me the proper answer. How does WordLift uses NLP?WordLift suggests to content editors relevant fact-based information, images and links by\u00a0analyzing content being written (either pages or post).WordLift uses\u00a0Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) to extract Named Entities from textual\u00a0contents.Editors can reconcile\u00a0entities extracted from their posts and pages\u00a0with\u00a0equivalent entities available on\u00a0other sources (i.e. DBpedia or Wikidata).\u00a0By automatically linking entities WordLift\u00a0helps machines unambiguously interpret the context of the content being written.This information, derived from these large open graphs such as\u00a0DBpedia, is also used by WordLift to\u00a0add the semantic markup using the vocabulary of\u00a0schema.org.What are Word Embeddings?Word embeddings (or text embeddings) are a type of algebraic representation of words that allows words with similar meaning to have similar mathematical representation. A vector is an array of numbers of a particular dimension. We calculate how close or distant two words are by measuring the distance between these vectors.Read more on how to optimize your Title tag SEO using text embeddings.Here is a quick intro to word and graph embeddings.[wl_faceted_search title=\"Read more about NLP and SEO\"]How does NLP help you with SEO?As we mentioned before in this article, NLP helps machines understand the context of what humans are writing. Combining NLP with semantic web technologies can significantly help you improve SEO and gain you a fair advantage over your competitors.

Natural language processing (NLP) is the artificial intelligence used by computers to interpret messages from humans into information, an example of that is the keywords used by search engines to retrieve relevant, information, graphs, and images.  What are Natural Language Processing Techniques? Natural language processing uses computers to process and understand language. NLP techniques are: Named Entity Recognition (NER) keyword extraction Stemming and Lemmatization Bag of Words Topic modeling Sentiment Analysis Sentence Segmentation  What is NLP Example? Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the communication tool between humans and computers, it exists in many forms such as spelling check, using google translate, and semantic search  Does Google use Natural Language Processing? Yes, Google uses Natural Language Processing, this is how Google interprets keywords to find the optimum and most relevant topic and show them in a specific sequence. Google uses NLP to automatically transform your search queries into actionable results  How does Google NLP work? Google uses NLP to understand the context of what humans are looking for using multiple NLP techniques. Keyword extraction can determine the topic and relevant results while the sentiments analysis determines the emotional attitude of the user. With the amount of information available on the web SERP analysis is an essential step in the process of content optimization to outrank the competition on Google.  Is Google NLP free? Yes, google NLP is free but with a maximum limit of 5000 units per month, additional units are chargeable  What is Human Language Processing?

        "text": "AI Text Generation for SEO: a practical example Transformer-based text generationIn recent years, there has been an increasing interest in open-ended language text generation (NLG), beginning with the release of OpenAI's famous GPT2 model. I have been following various approaches and network architectures with the same excitement I had when I used to play with my favourite model trains Lima. In this blog post, I will highlight some of the limitations of transformer-based text generation in the context of digital marketing tasks and present data-to-text as a possible solution to these pitfalls.&nbsp;The blog post contains a link to the code and the instructions to train your model using Google\u2019s T5 on generic data-to-text generation tasks that you can adapt to your own needs ?.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My beloved Lima trains ?Table of contents:Transformer-based text generationWhat is NLG?Introducing GPT-NeoLimits and pitfalls of automated text generation1. The proliferation of fake news and disinformation2. Unwanted prejudices and biases3. Inability to count and do math4. Limited generalization abilitiesCreating a simple model for data to text content generation using Google\u2019s T5Let\u2019s get started: the dataset (WebNLG Challenge)Fine-tuning the modelTime to automatically generate text Lessons learned and future workWhat SEO tasks can we automate using automatic content generation?What is NLG?Natural language generation (NLG) is a subfield of natural language processing, which is in turn a subfield of artificial intelligence research. Here below I will share the code that automatically transforms data coming from a knowledge graph into plain-English content. NLG can be used, in conjunction with your editorial team to, write sentences, paragraphs or even entire articles for you.Introducing GPT-NeoThanks to these sizeable transformer-based language models and libraries like Transformers by HuggingFace, state-of-the-art content generation has become as simple as writing two lines of code. The example below has been composed using GPT-Neo, a set of transformer-based language models that have been designed around the GPT architecture.You can play with the code I used for generating this example using the Google Colab notebook linked here. Here comes another example - using GPT-Neo - with an answer to my beloved question: \u201cIs SEO dead in 2021?\u201dThis approach of generating content is genuinely transformative for content creators, marketers, SEOs and has indeed generated tremendous hype.&nbsp;I began addressing writing meta descriptions using AI a while ago as I realised that this is one of these somehow tedious tasks that can be (semi) automated. Our content team logged tens of hours in creating these text snippets for our precious VIP clients. No kidding. Cutting down that effort by 60% has been an outstanding achievement.\u00a0Learn more about Prompt Engineering in SEO, what it is and how you can use diffusion models to make your SEO strategy different!Limits and pitfalls of automated text generation&nbsp;At the same time, and despite the hype, even advanced model architecture such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 have severe limitations that need to be taken into account when accomplishing even simple SEO tasks.&nbsp;1. The proliferation of fake news and disinformationOne of the risks is that even advanced language models have no understanding of the content that they produce. It is a fact that disinformation will get a boost as it gets straightforward to make false or misleading content that sounds credible (because of its style and choice of words).&nbsp;2. Unwanted prejudices and biases&nbsp;Another highly critical aspect is ethics. GPT-3, like most language models, is trained on human texts from various sources, and unfortunately, this also means that it reflects some of humanity\u2019s worst tendencies.Image is taken from GPT-3: Its Nature, Scope, Limits, and Consequences by Luciano Floridi &amp; Massimo Chiriatti. Paolo Benanti is Professor at the Pontifical Gregorian University and his insights on digital ethics are extremely valuable.3. Inability to count and do math&nbsp;Language models work on statistical patterns and can predict very well what the next word or sentence will be. Unfortunately, this doesn\u2019t mean that they can truly understand the question or the answer that they can provide. This also means that a language model cannot count or do any math operations that even a five-year-old would be able to do.&nbsp;If I prompt GPT-3 with simple mathematical operations such as (100*500)-2; while Google (or any other search engine) will answer in the blink of an eye, GPT-3 gets it wrong and goes off topic; it starts blathering about the power consumption of the light inside a fridge ?.&nbsp;While a language model shall not be compared to a search engine, it is clear that GPT-3\u2019s large brain will not pass the 1st Grade Math test.&nbsp;GPT-3 answering (100*500)-2In this other example, we see T5, brilliantly summarising web pages to answer a question about Modern SEO in 2020. Unfortunately, while it talks about 17 things to keep in mind (quoting the awesome Britney Muller), the list only includes 13 factors.&nbsp;4. Limited generalization abilitiesWhen we fine-tune a model, even language models like T5 or GPT-3 trained on a massive amount of content, we specialize it for a given use case (i.e. generating introductory text about companies in our database or product descriptions for our beautiful silk ties). In other words, the model that we obtain will only be valuable within that context and will not have optimal performances when used on other knowledge domains.In the example below, we can try to decrease the number of epochs to increase the generalizability of our model (an epoch in machine learning indicates the number of passes of the entire training dataset the&nbsp;machine learning&nbsp;algorithm has completed). Decreasing the epochs might harm the quality of the generated text, though.&nbsp; &nbsp;To learn more about SEO automation using GPT3 and transformer-based language models, check out Andrea's slides at BrightonSEO 2021 here.Creating a simple model for data to text content generation using Google\u2019s T5When working on SEO with automatically fabricated texts, we need to be even more intelligent and critical than usual. We want to create workflows where we collaboratively work with machines to create tangible and sustainable business value. This requires controlling content quality and semantic accuracy while limiting unwanted bias and prejudices.Due to the existing limitation of the technology, we cannot (yet) use GPT or other transformer-based language models by letting them run wild. We need to have a human-in-the-loop approach.For this reason, as deep learning is becoming more accessible by all means, I began experimenting with data-to-text generation approaches. Using a text-to-text transfer transformer like Google\u2019s T5 we will now fine-tune a model that will link structured information (i.e. metadata available in a knowledge graph about hospitals in Texas or product details for a merchant in New Zealand) with snippets of text.&nbsp;Jump directly to the code: T5 Data-to-TextIn a machine learning project, we use data for training and fine-tuning to convey the \u201crules\u201d of our system and to control the outcome.The project in Colab is self-explanatory but I will highlight some passages in the following paragraphs, and I encourage you to make a copy of the code and use it for your projects by replacing the training data. Mathew Alexander did the original work, and all the credit goes to him.&nbsp;&nbsp;Let\u2019s get started: the dataset (WebNLG Challenge)In the code, I provided we will use as a starting point the data from the WebNLG Challenge 2020.A snippet of code from the Colab that describes the data preparation phaseThe dataset comprises RDF triples (facts extracted from DBpedia) and their related textual description. In the Colab we will first download the dataset and then create a Pandas data frame with a prefix (webNLG), the input_text (these are the facts separated by \u201c|\u201d), and a target_text (this is the text that we expect to produce for that input_text).In the English corpus (there is also a Russian one that we will not consider) the data-text pairs are coming from 16 different DBpedia categories (or entity types): Airport, Astronaut, Building, City, ComicsCharacter, Food, Monument, SportsTeam, University, WrittenWork, Athlete, Artist, CelestialBody, MeanOfTransportation, Politician and Company.This is important because it defines the perimeter of the content that we will be able to generate. Also, we shall keep in mind that we\u2019re training a model using text from Wikipedia; therefore the tone of voice will be the one used by the encyclopedia (not necessarily a good fit for your website).&nbsp;Fine-tuning the modelHere I mount Google Drive that will be used to store the data and both the model and the tokenizer, once the training is complete. This requires you to authenticate and let Colab access Google Drive with your credentials. We will use Google T5-base as a starting point, and I have set 4 epochs for training.The training is done using PyTorch and, on a GPU machine, it will only take 50 minutes or so. Training is done using AdaFactor, and here you can find some helpful tips to experiment with the parameters.&nbsp;&nbsp;Time to automatically generate text ?Once the model is trained, it will be stored in Google Drive, and you will be able to load it directly from there the second time. Cell 4.1 of the Colab (as explained in the code) shall be run only if you have created the model in a previous session.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we see the first example on SEMRush CEO.[et_pb_section global_module=\"10498\"][/et_pb_section]Lessons learned and future work.The model is far from being perfect, and clearly, we would need a less generic dataset to obtain results that we can indeed use for SEO purposes. Nevertheless, as simple as this implementation can be, it helps us understand that we can \u201ccontrol\u201d a language model and how the content is generated as long as we have the correct data to train it on. We also need to focus on automatically validating the output of the generated text to prevent the risk of hallucinations (false statements and errors). Once again, if we have data organised in a knowledge graph, we can use this data to control semantic accuracy, mistakes and omissions of the generated text. In general, AI is a real game-changer in content marketing as long as we understand its limits. We need to create collaborative systems where humans are focused on high-level thinking (data preparation, training and validation) and AI does the heavy lifting (producing content on scale).What SEO tasks can we automate using automatic content generation?We are currently working on the following areas:Article first draft: writing content pieces that use text summarisation to provide editors with an initial text on a given topic.&nbsp;FAQ generation: finding the relevant questions for a given query and attempting to write the answer to these questions.&nbsp;Product description: writing targeted descriptions for products or categories of products for E-Commerce websites&nbsp;Introductory paragraphs: writing an introduction for category pagesWhat is your favourite use case?

It holds a central role in mathematics, holding many algebraic structures.\r\rThe word zero in English language comes from French\u00a0z\u00e9ro which comes from Italian\u00a0zero. The first use of zero in English was in 1598.\r\rLeonardo Fibonacci  (dated 1170\u20131250), an Italian mathematician who grew up in North Africa is the one who have introduced the decimal system in Europe along with the concept of void, for which he used the term\u00a0zephyrum.\r\rThe word zero is a transliteration of the arabic word\u00a0sifr, which means void. The symbol 0 was born while counting with stones on sand: when the last stone was taken away there was nothing anymore on the sand, except for a circular imprint.\r\rMathematically zero is an even number (divisible by 2 with no remainder), it is also the smallest non-negative integer and the only natural number not to be positive (nor negative).\r\rThe number is of course used to express a quantity, in this usage it is correct to identify it with nothingness. Although, a set with zero elements is empty but is still a set: when the score of a match is 0-0 it means that none of the teams has scored. The match has been played though and we can't say that \"nothing\" happened. It is not convenient to perfectly identify the number zero with the theorical concepts of nothingness and void.\r\rZero\u00a0is also used to number the Tarot card of The Fool, alongside with number twenty-two.\r\r\r\r&nbsp;\r\r&nbsp;\r\r&nbsp;\r\r&nbsp;",

        "text": "Google Pathways Jeff Dean, Senior Fellow, and SVP at Google announced the introduction of Pathways: a new AI architecture multi-tasking, multi-modal, and more efficient.Pathways will handle thousands or millions of tasks, understand multiple types of data, and do so with remarkable efficiency. It will move us forward from the era of single-purpose models to one in which more general-purpose intelligent systems reflect a deeper understanding of our world and adapt to new needs.What is Google Pathways?Pathways is a new way of thinking about AI that addresses many of the weaknesses of existing systems and synthesizes their strengths.Google Pathways is multi-tasking Jaff Dean says in his article: Today's AI models are typically trained to do only one thing. Pathways will enable us to train a single model to do thousands or millions of things.Today's machine learning systems are often trained from scratch for each new problem. This means that each model is trained to solve only one problem, and each time you introduce a model, you start from scratch. It is as if every time we learn a new skill, we forget the ones we knew before. The result is thousands of single models for single tasks that take more time and more data to learn.The idea with Pathways is to train a model that can handle multiple tasks together and learn new tasks faster because it draws on prior knowledge. So the idea is to create a model that combines already known capabilities and puts them together to perform further more complex tasks.Google Pathways is multi-modal Jeff Dean says in his article: Today's models mostly focus on one sense. Pathways will enable multiple senses.The world is generally perceived through different senses. Current AI systems process only one mode of information at a time: they can take in text, images, or speech but not all three at once.The idea of Google Pathways is to enable multi-modal models that include vision, hearing, and speech understanding simultaneously. The result would be models that are more insightful and less prone to error and bias.Google Pathways is more efficientIn the same article, Jeff Dean says: Today's models are dense and inefficient. Pathways will make them sparse and efficient.The third problem is that most of today's models are \"dense,\" meaning that the entire neural network is activated to accomplish a task, regardless of whether it is very simple or very complicated.The idea is to make Google Pathways work like the human brain, that is, to build a single model that is activated \"sparsely,\" meaning that only small paths through the network are called into action when needed.The model learns which parts of the network to activate in which situations and for which tasks. In this way, not only is the model able to learn multiple tasks together, but it can do so faster and more efficiently because it does not have to activate the entire network for each task.To find out more about Google Pathways, check out our Web Stories here.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTop SEO trends for 2023\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBLOOM for SEO\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPrompt engineering in SEO\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFAQ Schema Markup\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTopic Clusters SEO\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tView all stories\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t[wl_faceted_search title=\"Related articles\" template_id=\"\" post_id=\"\" uniqid=\"\" limit=\"10\" preview=\"\" preview_src=\"https://wordlift.io/blog/en/wp-content/plugins/wordlift/images/block-previews/faceted-search.png\" post_types=\"\" ]",

        "text": "Diving deep into Product Knowledge Panels Let\u2019s take a first look at Product Knowledge Graph Panels and how they can impact the organic traffic of your eCommerce website. In this article I will share everything I learned on this type of rich results.Before dissecting this new panel let\u2019s try to define them. Product Knowledge Graph Panels are information boxes that appear on Google when you search for products that are in the Knowledge Graph. They were first introduced on mobile back in November 2017.Get shopping information in a snap. Now with a single search, you can quickly find product photos, videos, reviews, descriptions and more. pic.twitter.com/4w0OXyvAJ2\u2014 Google (@Google) November 14, 2017Much like any other Knowledge Panels a Product Knowledge Panel is meant to help you get a quick snapshot of information on a specific product-entity based on Google\u2019s understanding of the available content on the web.&nbsp;Here is an example of an interactive filter on the size of a Weber Kettle (18, 22 or 23 inches?) Anatomy of a Product Knowledge PanelThis is by far the most interactive rich result that I have ever seen. The information is automatically generated, comes from various sources across the web, and allows you to quickly get access to:&nbsp;Product Details (descriptions, features, material, size, weight and a lot more depending on the product)&nbsp;Link to the official product page (this is a link to the product page on the manufacturer\u2019s website)Reviews (all the reviews from different websites, organized around the most frequently asked questions - this is powerful but, hey no links here!)&nbsp;Price Comparison (the list of all the stores that sell online that product)&nbsp;Panels are updated as information changes on the web and the layout - depending on the product - might also include:Personalized Ads (these are sponsored links that take you to the different online shops. I saw different behaviours here: ads that are separated from the panel - appearing before the panel or ads that are embedded in the \u201cStores\u201d section)&nbsp;Product videos (these are introductory product videos mostly coming from YouTube that present the product)Accessories (these are related products that can be purchased along with the main product - in the markup the property to be used is isAccessoryOrSparePartFor - this helps you link accessories of a main product)&nbsp;Critic reviews (these are direct links to an evaluation of the product written by an accredited author, it is important to use schema.org/Review or the review property nested inside schema.org/Product)How to optimize your content for Product Knowledge PanelsA few things are very clear so far.&nbsp;1. Write product reviews and make sure to match the product that you are targetingIf you produce product reviews you have a new opportunity to gain qualified traffic as long as you use structured data markup for Product or for Review (that target a Product). Products can be reconciled using the GTIN code - this is a globally unique 14-digit number used that identifies trade items, products, or services. You can also add a sameAs link to the entity in Google\u2019s Graph (i.e. the Weber Original Kettle 18\u201d has its own Machine-Readable IDs kgmid=/g/11b6rg_zd5 that you can use in the schema markup).&nbsp;Accredited reviews might get featured and have direct links2. Embed YouTube videos in articles using structured dataYou can also get very visible by embedding in your articles YouTube videos using the VideoObject markup. Articles with embedded videos can get higher ranking than the canonical video itself (as long as the content that you produce adds value to the video) ?I find it very interesting that it's possible to rank #1 in the video search results by embedding a YouTube video (+Schema) &amp; writing unique content about it. This SEJ content ranks even higher than the original YouTube video.So yes, in this case, more content *is* better ? pic.twitter.com/rosmjEoqKS\u2014 Lily Ray ? (@lilyraynyc) September 27, 20203. Use structured data markup on all your product pages (and if you are the manufacturer...don\u2019t forget to use the Google Manufacturer Center)All the manufacturers will get a direct link to their product pages and yes all of this might go at the expenses retailers that - on some queries at least - will be more likely forced to spend money on advertising.Manufacturers can also send product data using the Google Manufacturer Center, one of the most immediate and direct ways to send authoritative products information to Google. Bing also has a similar functionality but at the time of writing the website wasn\u2019t available. &nbsp;Adding structured data is essential and can help you earn the spot that you deserve. One example for all, if the panel features the \u201cAccessories\u201d tab; using schema markup will help Google create the link between the product articles that present the product\u2019s accessories (hence driving more clicks to these websites) .Here is an example of links that you can earn by helping Google understand a product\u2019s ecosystem.4. While critic reviews helps, customer reviews will not get you clicksAs of today user generated reviews are aggregated in the panel from multiple websites and do not have a link to the source. The content is very well organized (English only) around automatically generated queries that Google generates from all the reviews it acquires (the magical power of NLP).&nbsp;Conclusions and more insightsProduct Panels are completely new and provide the searcher with an immersive experience on Google Search. They are designed as a one-stop shop for products that you can buy online. Google is most probably experimenting a lot with these new rich results (I see things changing frequently especially in relationship to product ads) and metrics are still volatile.&nbsp;Having said so I did a quick analysis on a manufacturer website on a cluster of 100 queries on Google.com in the US. First a disclaimer: 100 queries from a single website is a small sample and, while it cannot be considered statistically relevant, it does shed some light.&nbsp;Here is what I discovered:&nbsp;Panels tend to appear on the most trafficked queries; more than half of the queries that I analysed had a panel already!!&nbsp;Impressions, when there is a panel, tend to jump (+110.85% more impressions on average when compared to queries where there is not a panel) - remember this is a manufacturer so they are always present,CTR goes down (-10.7% in comparison to queries with no panel) as we receive more impressions.KGPP (there is a Panel) - n.a. (there is no panel)[et_pb_section global_module=\"13147\"][/et_pb_section]The most important lessons learned Impressions have a growing importance in evaluating your business performances, as Google drives more engagement on its SERP, your site might get less clicks but you will still close the sales;To close the sales and to leverage on Knowledge Panels for Products you need to create (or aggregate) great content around products in the form of reviews, videos and top notch articles that compel users to purchase. A smooth online experience is made of multiple steps and these needs to be coherent and...well connected.High quality structured linked data along with a consistent content model can&nbsp; truly make a difference in helping Google understand your entities, their relationships and in the end this will help you sell more! &nbsp;Willing to review the schema markup on your eCommerce website?

        "text": "Rank Zero Since the introduction of the\u00a0Featured Snippets in 2014, Google is trying to answer to users' searches with quick organic answers and not only with the list of links we used to see before.These answers are the so-called\u00a0Rank Zero results: they are composed by\u00a0an extracted\u00a0answer (which takes data from other websites around), a display title and an URL. Sometimes they happen to be enriched with\u00a0images, tables, bulleted lists and more.Thanks to their position on the SERP, Rank Zero results tend to have a very high CTR.[wl_faceted_search]\u00a0Frequently Asked Questions   What is the zero position? Zero position refers to the answers extracted by google to the questions asked by the users, those answers are extracted from websites based on the most relevant ones to the questions asked. When creating well-optimized content professional SEOs analyze the top results in order to analyze the search intent and to get an overview of the competition.  What is the rank of the zero matrix? The zero matrix does not have any entries, and its rank is zero. Once the matrix contained even a single entry it cannot be ranked zero any longer.  What is an example of Google search result that can be found in position 0? Google search result that can be found in position 0 is usually the first answer shown on the search, it is the answer that includes the most relevant information to the question or the topic. This kind of analysis is called SERP (Search Engine Result Page) analysis which is part of keyword research and helps you understand if the query that you identified is relevant for your business goals. More importantly by analyzing how results are organized we can understand how Google is interpreting a specific query.  What is position in SEO? A position in search engine optimization (SEO) is the place at which the website appears in google search, a position is driven by the most relevant information and the traffic of the website. Google shows the results that it feels are most valuable and relevant to its user, meaning that your Brand SERP reflects Google\u2019s perception of your brand in the context of your audience.  What is full rank? A full rank matrix refers to a matrix with ranks that are equal to the largest possible of a matrix with the same dimensions, however, if the ranks are smaller than the largest possible dimensions, it is called rank deficient     ",
